        "description": "Cell and gene therapy workshops | Genetic Alliance UK\nCell and gene therapy workshops\nGenetic Alliance UK are about to launch a new programme to examine gene and cell therapies with our community. We will learn about the technologies from experts and explore the aspects of the treatments that participants feel are most important to the community. We hope to develop a group of informed spokespeople from the genetic, rare and undiagnosed community who understand and can talk about the therapies and produce a guide for engaging with our community on this topic.\nWe're looking for people affected by a rare, genetic condition directly, either as patients, parents or carers. Are there people in your networks who would like to be part of this series of workshops? Is cell and gene therapy on the horizon for your community, or much nearer?\nBuilding on our previous 'Talking About Genome Editing' project where we collaborated with the Progress Educational Trust to explore the language, messages and implications of genome editing, we want to educate and empower those who are directly affected by rare, genetic or undiagnosed conditions and could benefit from being treated with cell and gene therapy, now or in the future.\nWe will have two workshops in March and April and we hope to take participants to visit a site for research or manufacture of cell or gene therapy.\nIf there are individuals within your networks that would be interested in participating, or you would like to know more, then please get in touch with us by emailing [email protected].\nUniversität Wien (via Public) / How do metals interact with DNA?\nTSD Times Summer Edition is here!\nRueda informativa ofrecida por la portavoz del MAE de Rusia, María[...]\nBriefing by Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova, Samara, June[...]\n\"Il suolo regala tanto. Non calpestiamolo\"- Convegno finale del[...]\n03/21/2017 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 03/22/2017 03:34\nThe teams of Leticia González from the Faculty of Chemistry of the University of Vienna and Jacinto Sá from Uppsala University have developed a protocol that is able to detect with high precision how, where, and why a drug interacts with the biomolecules of an organism. 'In a first step, using high-energy X-ray radiation from the Swiss Light Source third-generation-synchrotron, the favorite binding location of the drug inside the cell is determined', González explains. In a second step, advanced theoretical simulations, partially done on the supercomputer 'Vienna Scientific Cluster', rationalize the preference of the potential medicament for that particular location.\nThe scientists have applied this protocol to the drug Pt103, which is known to have cytotoxic properties but an unknown mechanism of action. The compound Pt103, which belongs to the family of the so-called platinum-based drugs, showed promising antitumor activity in previous studies. Until recently, scientists could only speculate on the action of the compound with the DNA found inside a human or cancer cell. 'We could show that the drug binds to a specific site of DNA, which was not expected based on previous research. And we could also explain why the drug attacks this particular site' says Juan J. Nogueira, a postdoctoral researcher in the group of González and co-author of the study. Using this newly gained knowledge one can better understand the functionality of the corresponding chemotherapeutic agent, which might lead to the development of new and more efficient drugs.\nPublication in 'Journal of Physical Chemistry Letters'\n'Direct Determination of Metal Complexes Interaction with DNA by Atomic Telemetry and Multiscale Molecular Dynamics.'

What is it for?\nAPLACTIN contains pravastatin, a substance belonging to the group of statins, drugs capable of reducing the level of fat and cholesterol in the blood. This action is made possible by the blocking of an enzyme important in the synthesis of cholesterol itself, called HMG-CoA reductase.\nAPLACTIN is indicated in adults in the following cases:\nTreatment of primary (familial) hypercholesterolaemia or mixed dyslipidaemia (changes in the amount of fat in the blood) as an adjunct to diet, when the response to diet or other non-drug treatments (e.g. exercise or weight reduction) has been inadequate .\nReduction of mortality and the frequency of cardiovascular disease (affecting the heart and / or blood vessels) in patients with moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia and at high risk of a first cardiovascular event (heart attack, stroke), in addition to the diet.\nReduction in mortality and the frequency of cardiovascular disease in patients who have had a history of myocardial infarction (death of part of the heart tissue caused by the closure of a vessel that carries blood to the heart) or unstable angina pectoris (pain in the chest due to a temporary decrease in blood flow and oxygen to the heart) and who have normal or elevated cholesterol levels, in addition to correcting other risk factors.\nReduction of hyperlipidemia (increase in blood fat levels) following transplantation in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy (therapy to avoid rejection of the transplanted organ) following transplantation of a solid organ (eg liver, pancreas, kidneys) (see section 3 \"How to take APLACTIN\" and \"Other medicines and APLACTIN\").\nContraindications When Aplactin should not be used\nDo not take APLACTIN\nIf you are allergic to pravastatin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).\nIf you have active liver disease (liver disease) and if you have a marked and lasting increase in levels of transaminases in the blood (enzymes that indicate liver function), which exceed 3 times the maximum permitted limits (see \"Warnings and precautions\" ).\nPrecautions for use What you need to know before taking Aplactin\nTalk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking APLACTIN.\nBefore starting treatment with APLACTIN, tell your doctor:\nif you suffer from kidney failure (impaired kidney function);\nif you have hypothyroidism (decreased thyroid function);\nif you have previously had problems with muscle toxicity from 'using statins and fibrates (see' Other medicines and APLACTIN ') or another cholesterol-lowering medicine, such as nicotinic acid (niacin);\nif you or someone in your family have hereditary muscle disorders;\nif you suffer from alcoholism (alcohol dependence);\nif you are over 70, especially if you have other factors that could predispose you to muscle disorders;\nif you are taking or have taken within the last 7 days a medicine called fusidic acid (used to treat bacterial infections) by mouth or by injection; the combination of fusidic acid with APLACTIN can cause severe muscle problems (rhabdomyolysis).\nIn these cases, the doctor will need to perform a blood test to assess creatine kinase (CK) levels before starting therapy.\nTell your doctor immediately if you experience symptoms such as pain, tension, weakness or muscle cramps of unknown nature during treatment, because blood tests are needed to evaluate creatine kinase (CK) levels, or it may be necessary to stop taking treatment. This medicine can cause muscle problems such as myalgia (muscle pain), myopathy (disease affecting muscles) Rhabdomyolysis (disease characterized by damage to muscle fibers), even fatal, may occur very rarely, which may be associated with secondary renal failure (alteration of function kidney resulting from other pathologies).\nStop taking this medicine and see your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms, especially if you are being treated with this medicine for a long time, as interstitial lung disease (lung problem) can occur:\nWhile you are being treated with this medicine, your doctor will check the levels of enzymes produced by the liver (AST and ALT) and will tell you to stop taking APLACTIN if the levels are three times above normal and consistently.\nTell your doctor if you have suffered from liver disease (liver disease) in the past or if you regularly consume alcohol, as special caution should be used in these cases.\nDuring therapy with this medicine, blood sugar (blood sugar concentration) may rise and, in some patients at high risk of developing diabetes, it may cause an excessive rise in blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) that may require diabetes therapy.\nYour doctor will monitor you closely if you have high levels of blood sugar, triglycerides (fat) and high blood pressure.\nAPLACTIN is not suitable when hypercholesterolemia is due to high HDL cholesterol levels.\nThe use of APLACTIN in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended.\nInteractions Which drugs or foods can change the effect of Aplactin\nTell your doctor if you are taking medicines called fibrates (eg gemfibrozil, fenofibrate) and used to lower the fat (cholesterol) content in the blood; concurrent use with APLACTIN is not recommended because it may increase the risk of muscle problems (see \"Warnings and Precautions\"). Your doctor will perform specific tests (control of creatine kinase, CK levels).\nTake this medicine with caution and talk to your doctor if you are taking the following medicines:\nColestyramine or Colestipol (drugs used to lower cholesterol levels in the blood). When APLACTIN is taken simultaneously with these drugs it may decrease its therapeutic effect. APLACTIN should be taken 1 hour before or 4 hours after cholestyramine or 1 hour before colestipol. In order not to have a therapeutic decrease of pravastatin (see section 3 \"How to take APLACTIN\");\nCyclosporine. The simultaneous intake of cyclosporine (a drug used to prevent rejection reactions after organ transplantation) and APLACTIN increases the body's exposure to the drug by about 4 times or more;\nErythromycin and clarithromycin (antibiotics). These drugs can lead to an increase in the concentration of pravastatin in the blood.\nIf you are taking a medicine used to treat and prevent blood clots called a \"vitamin K antagonist\", please tell your doctor before taking APLACTIN as the use of vitamin K antagonists concomitantly with APLACTIN may alter the test results. blood used to monitor treatment with vitamin K antagonists.\nIf you need to take oral fusidic acid to treat a bacterial infection you should temporarily stop using this medicine. Your doctor will tell you when you can resume treatment with APLACTIN. Taking APLACTIN with fusidic acid may rarely cause muscle weakness, burning or pain (rhabdomyolysis). For more information on rhabdomyolysis, see section 4 \"Possible side effects\".\nDo not take APLACTIN during pregnancy (see \"Do not take APLACTIN\").\nIf during therapy with APLACTIN you realize that you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, please inform your doctor immediately and stop treatment due to the potential risk to the fetus.\nDo not take APLACTIN while breastfeeding because a small amount of pravastatin is excreted in breast milk (see \"Do not take APLACTIN\").\nAPLACTIN has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, you may feel dizzy after taking APLACTIN. If this happens to you, avoid driving or using machines.\nAPLACTIN contains lactose.\nDose, Method and Time of Administration How to use Aplactin: Posology\nBefore starting therapy with APLACTIN, the doctor will rule out secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia (eg hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, excessive fat intake with diet).\nBefore and during treatment with APLACTIN you must follow a diet to lower the levels of fat in the blood (standard lipid-lowering diet). Take APLACTIN by mouth once a day, preferably in the evening, with or without food.\nThe duration of treatment varies according to medical prescription.\nThe recommended dose varies in the following cases:\nin the treatment of hypercholesterolemia (high blood fat levels) it is 10-40 mg once a day. Response is seen within one week and full effect is achieved within four weeks. Your doctor will check your blood fat levels and adjust the dose based on the results of the tests. The maximum daily dose is 40 mg.\nin cardiovascular prevention (prevention of heart disorders) is 40 mg per day.\nin therapy after organ transplantation the recommended starting dose is 20 mg per day if you are being treated with specific medicines (immunosuppressive therapy). Your doctor will adjust your dose up to a maximum of 40 mg per day.\nThe use of APLACTIN is not recommended.\nDosage adjustment is not necessary in the elderly unless there are predisposing risk factors (see \"Warnings and precautions\")\nUse in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency (kidney or liver problems)\nIf you have moderate or severe renal insufficiency or significant hepatic insufficiency the recommended starting dose is 10 mg per day. Your doctor will adjust the dosage based on your fat level.\nSimultaneous therapy with other drugs\nIf you are taking a resin, ie a bile acid sequestering drug (such as cholestyramine and colestipol) at the same time, take APLACTIN one \"hour before or at least four hours after the resin (see\" Other medicines and APLACTIN \").\nIf you are taking cyclosporine (a medicine used in organ transplantation), with or without other immunosuppressive medicines, the recommended starting dose of APLACTIN is 20 mg per day.\nIncreasing the dose to 40 mg should be done with caution and under medical supervision (See \"Other medicines and APLACTIN\").\nOverdose What to do if you have taken too much Aplactin\nIn case of accidental ingestion / intake of an overdose of APLACTIN, notify your doctor immediately or go to the nearest hospital.\nSide Effects What are the side effects of Aplactin\nmuscle pain (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia), muscle cramps, muscle weakness, high levels of a substance produced by the muscles (creatine kinase, CK);\nincreased levels of liver enzymes (serum transaminases).\nThe following undesirable effects have also been reported during clinical trials and following marketing of APLACTIN:\ndizziness, headache (headache);\nsleep disturbances including insomnia and nightmares;\nvision disturbances, including blurred vision and double vision;\ndigestive and burning disorders, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, bloating;\nitching, rash, hives, scalp and hair changes, including hair loss;\ndifficulty urinating (dysuria), frequent passing of small amounts of urine (pollakiuria) and repeated urge to urinate during the night's rest (nocturia);\nperipheral polyneuropathy (disease affecting multiple nerves), especially with prolonged treatment, and paraesthesia (decreased sensitivity of a part of the body);\nhypersensitivity reactions such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematosus-like syndrome;\njaundice (yellowing of the skin), hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) and fulminant hepatic necrosis;\nrhabdomyolysis (disease characterized by damage to muscle fibers) which may be associated with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria (presence of myoglobin in the urine) and myopathy (muscle disorders) (see \"Warnings and precautions\").\nUndesirable effects of unknown frequency (frequency of which cannot be determined from the available data)\nconstant muscle weakness (immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy).\nUndesirable effects related to the class of statins\ninterstitial lung disease (disease characterized by alteration of the tissue lining the pulmonary alveoli which can manifest itself with breathing problems such as persistent cough and / or shortness of breath), in exceptional cases especially in long-term therapy (see \"Warnings and precautions \");\ndiabetes mellitus, frequency depends on the presence or absence of risk factors (fasting blood glucose ≥ 5.6 mmol / L, BMI> 30 kg / m2, elevated triglyceride levels, history of hypertension);\ndermatomyositis (a condition characterized by \"inflammation of the muscles and skin).\nThe expiry date refers to the last day of that month and to the product in intact packaging, correctly stored.\nStore the medicine below 30 ° C.\nWhat APLACTIN contains\nOne 20 mg tablet contains:\nthe active ingredient is pravastatin sodium salt 20 mg.\nThe other ingredients are lactose monohydrate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, yellow iron oxide (E172).\nOne 40 mg tablet contains:\nthe active ingredient is pravastatin sodium salt 40 mg.\nDescription of what APLACTIN looks like and contents of the pack\nEach pack contains 10 tablets of 20 mg\nEach pack contains 14 tablets of 40 mg\nFurther information on Aplactin can be found in the \"Summary of Characteristics\" tab. 01.0 NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT -

The therapeutic response is evident within one week and the full effect of a certain dose is obtained within four weeks, therefore periodic evaluations of the lipid profile should be carried out. and the dosage should be adjusted accordingly.The maximum daily dose is 40 mg.\nCardiovascular prevention: In all morbidity and mortality prevention clinical trials, the only starting and maintenance dose studied was 40 mg daily.\nDosage after transplantation: In patients on immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplantation, a starting dose of 20 mg per day is recommended (see section 4.5).\nBased on the response of lipid parameters, the dose can be adjusted up to 40 mg under close medical supervision (see section 4.5).\nChildren: Documentation on efficacy and safety in patients below 18 years of age is limited, therefore the use of APLACTIN is not recommended in these patients.\nElderly patients: No dosage adjustment is necessary in these patients unless there are predisposing risk factors (see section 4.4).\nRenal or hepatic impairment: In patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or with significant hepatic impairment, a starting dose of 10 mg per day is recommended. Dosage should be adjusted according to the response of lipid parameters and under medical supervision.\nConcomitant therapy: The lipid-lowering effects of APLACTIN on total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol are enhanced when administered in combination with a bile acid sequestering resin (eg, cholestyramine, colestipol). APLACTIN should be administered 1 hour before or at least 4 hours after the resin (see section 4.5).\nFor patients receiving ciclosporin, with or without other immunosuppressive medicinal products, treatment should start with pravastatin 20 mg once daily and dose escalation up to 40 mg should be implemented with caution (see section 4.5). .\n- Active hepatopathies including persistent undetermined elevations of serum transaminases exceeding 3 times the upper limit of normal (see section 4.4).\nPravastatin has not been evaluated in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Treatment is not suitable when hypercholesterolemia is due to elevated HDL cholesterol.\nAs with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, the combination of pravastatin with fibrates is not recommended (see section 4.5).\nHepatic Disorders: As with other lipid-lowering drugs, moderate increases in hepatic transaminases have been reported. In most cases, liver transaminase levels returned to their baseline value without having to stop treatment. Particular care should be taken in patients who develop elevations in transaminase levels and therapy should be discontinued if elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) exceed 3 times the upper limits of the norm and are persistent.\nCaution should be exercised when administering pravastatin to patients with a history of liver disease or alcoholism.\nMuscle disorders: As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), pravastatin has been associated with the onset of myalgia, myopathy and, very rarely, rhabdomyolysis. Myopathy should be considered in all patients on statin therapy who present with muscle symptoms of unknown nature such as pain or tension, muscle weakness or muscle cramps. In such cases, creatine kinase (CK) levels should be checked (see below). Statin therapy should be temporarily discontinued if CK levels are> 5 times the ULN or in the event of severe clinical symptoms. Very rarely (in approximately 1 case per 100,000 patient-years), rhabdomyolysis has occurred, with or without secondary renal insufficiency. Rhabdomyolysis is an acute, potentially fatal, skeletal muscle condition that can develop at any time during treatment and is characterized by massive muscle destruction associated with a substantial increase in CK (usually> 30 or 40 times the upper limit of normal ) which leads to myoglobinuria.\nThe risk of myopathy with statin use appears to be exposure dependent and therefore may vary with individual drug characteristics (due to differences in lipophilicity and pharmacokinetics), including dosage and drug interaction potential. Although there is no muscle contraindication to the prescription of a statin, some predisposing factors may increase the risk of muscle toxicity and therefore justify a \"careful evaluation of the benefit / risk ratio and a particular clinical monitoring. In such patients, control of CK is indicated. before starting statin treatment (see below).\nThe risk and severity of muscle disorders during therapy with a statin are increased by the co-administration of interacting drugs. Occasionally the use of fibrates alone is associated with myopathy. The combined use of a statin with fibrates should generally be avoided. Co-administration of statins and nicotinic acid should be used with caution. An increase in the incidence of myopathy has also been described in patients receiving other statins in combination with cytochrome P450 metabolism inhibitors. This may result from pharmacokinetic interactions that have not been documented for pravastatin (see section 4.5). When combined with treatment. with statins, muscle symptoms generally resolve upon discontinuation of therapy.\nCreatine kinase levels and their interpretation: Periodic monitoring of creatine kinase (CK) or other muscle enzymes is not recommended in asymptomatic patients on statin therapy. However, it is recommended that CK be monitored prior to initiating therapy with a statin in patients with specific predisposing factors and in patients who have developed muscular symptoms during statin therapy, as described below. If baseline CK levels are significantly elevated (> 5 times the upper limits of normal), these will need to be re-measured 5 to 7 days later to confirm the results.\nOnce measured, CK levels need to be interpreted in the context of other potential factors that can cause transient muscle damage, such as strenuous exercise or muscle trauma.\nBefore starting the treatment: Caution should be exercised in patients with predisposing factors such as renal failure, hypothyroidism, previous history of muscle toxicity with a statin or with fibrates, personal or family history of hereditary muscle disorders or alcoholism. In these cases the CK levels will need to be measured before starting therapy. Measurement of CK levels should also be considered before starting treatment in people over 70 years of age, especially in the presence of other predisposing factors in this population. If baseline CK levels are significantly elevated (> 5 times the upper limit of normal), treatment should not be initiated and levels should be re-measured after 5 & -; 7 days. Baseline CK levels may also be useful as a reference in the event of a subsequent increase during statin therapy.\nDuring the treatment: Patients should be advised to promptly report the onset of muscle pain, tension, weakness or cramps of unknown nature. In these cases, CK levels should be measured. If a markedly elevated CK level (> 5 times the upper limit of normal) is detected, statin therapy should be discontinued. Also, discontinuation of treatment should be considered if muscle symptoms are severe and cause discomfort throughout the day, even if the CK rise remains? 5 times the upper limits of the norm. If symptoms resolve and CK levels return to normal, reintroduction of statin therapy at a lower dose and closely monitored may be considered. If an inherited muscle disorder is suspected in such patients, reintroduction of statin therapy is not recommended.\nPravastatin should not be co-administered with systemic fusidic acid formulations or within 7 days of discontinuing fusidic acid treatment. In patients where systemic use of fusidic acid is considered essential, statin treatment should be discontinued. for the duration of the fusidic acid treatment. There have been reports of rhabdomyolysis (including some deaths) in patients treated with fusidic acid and statins in combination (see section 4.5). The patient should be advised to consult a physician immediately if he experiences symptoms of muscle weakness, pain or tenderness.\nStatin therapy can be reintroduced seven days after the last dose of fusidic acid is given.\nIn exceptional circumstances, where prolonged systemic treatment with fusidic acid is required, for example in the case of severe infections, the need for co-administration of pravastatin and fusidic acid should only be considered on a case-by-case basis and under close medical supervision.\nInterstitial lung disease: Exceptional cases of interstitial lung disease have been reported with some statins, especially with long-term therapy (see section 4.8). Symptoms may include dyspnoea, non-productive cough and deterioration in general health (fatigue, weight loss and fever). If it is suspected that a patient has developed interstitial lung disease, statin therapy should be discontinued.\nDiabetes mellitus: Some evidence suggests that statins, as a class effect, increase blood glucose and in some patients, at high risk of developing diabetes, may induce a level of hyperglycemia such that antidiabetic therapy is appropriate. This risk, however, is outweighed by the reduction in vascular risk with the use of statins and therefore should not be a reason for discontinuation of treatment. Patients at risk (fasting glucose 5.6 - 6.9 mmol / L, BMI> 30 kg / m² , elevated triglyceride levels, hypertension) should be monitored both clinically and biochemically in accordance with national guidelines.\nThe medicine contains lactose therefore patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine.\nFibrates: The use of fibrates alone is occasionally associated with myopathy. An increased risk of muscle adverse events, including rhabdomyolysis, has been found when given in combination with other statins. These adverse events cannot be excluded with the use of pravastatin, therefore the combined use of pravastatin and fibrates (eg, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate) should generally be avoided (see section 4.4). If this combination is considered necessary, careful clinical monitoring and control of CK levels is required for patients on this regimen.\nColestyramine / Colestipol: When administered concomitantly, approximately 40 to 50% decrease in the bioavailability of pravastatin was observed. Administration of pravastatin 1 hour before or 4 hours after cholestyramine or 1 hour before colestipol did not result in clinically significant decreases in the bioavailability or therapeutic effect of pravastatin (see section 4.2).\nCiclosporin: Co-administration of pravastatin and cyclosporine leads to an approximately 4-fold increase in systemic exposure to pravastatin. However, in some patients the increase in pravastatin exposure may be greater. Clinical and biochemical monitoring of patients is recommended. being treated with this combination (see section 4.2).\nVitamin K antagonists: As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, treatment initiation or dose increase of pravastatin in patients concomitantly treated with vitamin K inhibitors (eg warfarin or other coumarin anticoagulants) may result in increased of the International Normalized Ratio (or INR, International Normalized Ratio). On the other hand, interrupting or reducing the dosage of pravastatin may result in a reduction in INR. In these situations, adequate monitoring of the INR is necessary.\nThe steady state bioavailability parameters of pravastatin were not altered following administration of warfarin.\nDrugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450: Pravastatin is not metabolically significantly metabolised by the cytochrome P450 complex. This is why drugs that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, or are inhibitors of it, can be added to a stable regimen of pravastatin without causing significant changes in the plasma levels of pravastatin, as has been observed with other statins. The absence of significant pharmacokinetic interaction with pravastatin has been specifically demonstrated for several substances, particularly those which are substrates / inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as diltiazem, verapamil, itraconazole, ketoconazole, protease inhibitors, grapefruit juice and CYP2C9 inhibitors ( eg: fluconazole).\nA statistically significant increase in pravastatin AUC (70%) and Cmax (121%) was observed in one of the two interaction studies with pravastatin and erythromycin. A statistically significant increase in AUC (110%) and Cmax (127%) was observed in a similar study with clarithromycin. Although these are minor changes, care should be taken when combining pravastatin with erythromycin or clarithromycin.\nFusidic acid: The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, may be increased by concomitant administration of systemic fusidic acid and statins. The mechanism of this interaction (whether it is pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic or both) is still unknown. There have been reports of rhabdomyolysis (including some deaths) in patients treated with this combination.\nIf systemic treatment with fusidic acid is required, pravastatin treatment should be suspended for the duration of fusidic acid treatment. See also section 4.4.\nOther drugs: No statistically significant differences in bioavailability were noted in interaction studies when pravastatin is administered with acetylsalicylic acid, antacids (taken 1 hour before pravastatin), nicotinic acid or probucol.\nPregnancy: Pravastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy and should only be given to women of childbearing potential when pregnancy is highly unlikely and when they have been advised of the potential risk. If pregnancy is planned or established, the physician should be informed immediately and pravastatin therapy discontinued due to the potential risk to the fetus.\nLactation: a small amount of pravastatin is excreted in human milk, therefore pravastatin is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see section 4.3).\nPravastatin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. However, when driving vehicles or operating machines, it should be taken into account that dizziness may occur during treatment.\nThe frequency of undesirable effects is classified according to the following convention: very common (≥1 / 10); common (≥1 / 100,\nClinical trials: APLACTIN was studied at a dose of 40 mg in seven randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials involving more than 21,000 patients treated with pravastatin (N = 10,764) or placebo (N = 10,719), representing more than 47,000 patient-years of pravastatin exposure. More than 19,000 patients were followed up for a median of 4.8 & -; 5.9 years.\nThe following adverse drug reactions have been reported; none occurred at a frequency in excess of 0.3% in the pravastatin group compared to the placebo group.\nUncommon: dizziness, headache, sleep disturbances including insomnia and nightmares\nUncommon: visual disturbances (including blurred vision and diplopia)\nUncommon: dyspepsia / burning, abdominal pain, nausea / vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, flatulence\nUncommon: pruritus, rash, hives, scalp / hair changes (including alopecia)\nUncommon: Micturition disturbances (including dysuria, pollakiuria, nocturia)\nDiseases of the reproductive system and breast:\nMusculoskeletal and connective tissue disordersEffects on skeletal muscle have been reported in clinical trials, eg: musculoskeletal pain including arthralgia, muscle cramps, myalgia, muscle weakness and elevated CK levels. The percentage of myalgia (1.4% pravastatin vs 1.4% placebo) and muscle weakness (0.1% pravastatin vs 3 times the ULN and> 10 times the ULN in CARE, WOSCOPS and LIPIDs are similar in the placebo groups (1.6% pravastatin vs 1.6% placebo and 1.0% pravastatin vs 1.0% placebo, respectively) (see section 4.4).\nHepatobiliary disorders: elevations of serum transaminases have been reported. In the three long-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials, CARE, WOSCOPS and LIPID, marked alterations in ALT and AST levels (> 3 times the ULN) occurred at a similar frequency (≤ 1.2%). in both treatment groups.\nIn addition to the above, the following undesirable effects have been reported since the marketing of pravastatin:\nVery rare: peripheral polyneuropathy, particularly after long-term use, paraesthesia\nVery rare: hypersensitivity reactions: anaphylaxis, angioedema, lupus erythematosus-like syndrome\nVery rare: rhabdomyolysis which may be associated with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria, myopathy (see section 4.4)\nThe following side effects have also been reported with the use of statins:\n• exceptional cases of interstitial lung disease, especially in long-term therapy (see section 4.4)\n• Diabetes mellitus: frequency depends on the presence or absence of risk factors (fasting blood glucose ≥ 5.6 mmol / L, BMI> 30 kg / m², elevated triglyceride levels, history of hypertension).\nReporting of suspected adverse reactions occurring after authorization of the medicinal product is important as it allows continuous monitoring of the benefit / risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system. \"address http / www.agenziafarmaco.gov.it / it / responsible\nThere is limited experience to date with pravastatin overdose. In case of overdose there is no specific treatment. In this case, the patient should be treated symptomatically and with appropriate supportive measures.\nPharmacotherapeutic group: lipid-lowering agents, cholesterol and triglyceride reducing agents, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors; ATC code: C10AA03\nPravastatin is a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the early passage that limits the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis, and produces its lipid-lowering effect in two ways First, through a specific and reversible competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, pravastatin produces a modest reduction in intracellular cholesterol synthesis. This leads to an increase in the number of LDL receptors on the cell surface and increases receptor-mediated catabolism and elimination of circulating LDL cholesterol.\nSecond, pravastatin inhibits LDL production by inhibiting hepatic synthesis of VLDL cholesterol, the precursor of LDL cholesterol.\nIn both healthy subjects and in patients with hypercholesterolemia, pravastatin sodium salt lowered the following lipid values: total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides; while HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A were elevated.\nThe West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of 6,595 male patients aged 45 to 64 years with moderate to severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol = 155 & -; 232 mg / dl [4.0 & -; 6.0 mmol / l]) and with no history of myocardial infarction, treated for a mean duration of 4.8 years at a dose of 40 mg once daily pravastatin or placebo in addition to the diet. In patients treated with pravastatin the results showed:\n- a reduction in the risk of death from coronary heart disease and non-fatal myocardial infarction (the relative risk reduction RRR was 31%; p = 0.0001 with an absolute risk of 7.9% in the placebo group and 5, 5% in patients treated with pravastatin); the effects on the incidence of these cumulative cardiovascular events were already evident after six months of treatment;\n- a reduction in the total number of deaths from a cardiovascular event (RRR 32%; p = 0.03);\n- that taking into account the risk factors, an RRR of death from all causes of 24% (p = 0.039) is also observed among patients treated with pravastatin;\n- a reduction in the relative risk of subjecting the patient to myocardial revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass graft or coronary angioplasty) of 37% (p = 0.009) and of coronary angiography by 31% (p = 0.007).\nThe benefit of the treatment, according to the above criteria, is not known in patients over the age of 65, as it could not be included in the study.\nGiven the lack of data on patients with hypercholesterolaemia associated with triglyceride levels above 5.3 g / l (6 mmol / l) after an 8-week diet, the benefit of pravastatin treatment was not established in this study. type of patients.\nThe Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing the effects of pravastatin (40 mg once daily) with placebo on 9,014 patients, between 31 and 75 years of age, for a mean duration of 5.6 years, with normal to high cholesterol (baseline total cholesterol = 155 & -; 271 mg / dl [4.0 & -; 7.0 mmol / l], mean total cholesterol = 219 mg / dl [5.66 mmol / l]) and with variable triglyceride levels up to 443 mg / dl [5.0 mmol / l] and with a history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris within the previous 3 & -; 36 months. Treatment with pravastatin significantly reduced the relative risk of death from coronary heart disease by 24% (p = 0.0004, with an absolute risk of 6.4% in the placebo group and 5.3% in patients treated with pravastatin), the relative risk of coronary events (death from coronary artery disease or non-fatal myocardial infarction) of 24% (p\n- a reduction in the relative risk of death from all causes by 23% (cardiovascular p by 25% (p\n- a reduction in the relative risk of using myocardial revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) of 20% (p\n- a 19% reduction in the relative risk of stroke (p = 0.048).\nThe \"Cholesterol and Recurrent Events\" (CARE) study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that compared the effects of pravastatin (40 mg once daily) on death from coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction. non-fatal for a mean of 4.9 years out of 4,159 patients, aged 21 to 75 years, with normal total cholesterol (mean total baseline cholesterol\n- the incidence of recurrent coronary events (death from coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial infarction) of 24% (p = 0.003, placebo 13.3%, pravastatin 10.4%);\n- the relative risk of recourse to revascularization procedures (coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) of 27% (p\nThe relative risk of stroke was also reduced by 32% (p = 0.032) and the risk of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) combined was reduced by 27% (p = 0.02).\nThe benefit of the treatment according to the above criteria is not known in patients over 75 years of age, as it could not be included in the CARE and LIPID studies.\nIn the absence of data on hypercholesterolemic patients with triglyceride levels greater than 3.5 g / l (4 mmol / l) or greater than 4.45 g / l (5 mmol / l) respectively in the CARE and LIPID studies, after a 4 or 8 week diet regimen, the benefit of pravastatin treatment in these patients has not been established.\nIn the CARE and LIPID clinical trials, approximately 80% of patients took acetylsalicylic acid as part of their treatment.\nThe efficacy of pravastatin in patients treated with immunosuppressants following:\n• heart transplant, was assessed in a prospective, randomized and controlled study (n = 97). Patients were treated simultaneously with pravastatin (20 & -; 40 mg) or less and a standard immunosuppressive regimen of cyclosporine, prednisone and azathioprine. Treatment with pravastatin significantly reduced the incidence of cardiac rejection with haemodynamic compromise at one year, increased survival to one year (p = 0.025), and lowered the risk of coronary vascular disease during transplantation as demonstrated by angiography and from the autopsy (p = 0.049).\n• kidney transplant, was evaluated in a prospective, uncontrolled, non-randomized study (n = 48) of 4 months duration. Patients were treated simultaneously with pravastatin (20 mg) or less and a standard immunosuppressive regimen of cyclosporine and prednisone.\nIn renal transplant patients, pravastatin significantly reduced both the incidence of multiple rejection episodes, the incidence of biopsy-confirmed acute rejection episodes and the use of intermittent injections of both prednisolone and Muromonab-CD3.\nPravastatin is administered by mouth in its active form. It is rapidly absorbed and peak serum levels are reached 1 & -; 1.5 hours after ingestion. On average 34% of the oral dose is absorbed, with an absolute bioavailability of 17%.\nThe presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract leads to a reduction in bioavailability, but the cholesterol-lowering effect of pravastatin is the same whether it is taken with or without food.\nAfter absorption, 66% of pravastatin undergoes a first extraction from the circulation in the liver, which is the main site of its action and the main site of cholesterol synthesis and elimination of LDL cholesterol. Studies in vitro have shown that pravastatin is transported to hepatocytes and, to a substantially lesser extent, to other cells.\nIn light of this substantial first pass through the liver, the plasma concentrations of pravastatin have only limited value in predicting a lipid-lowering effect.\nPlasma concentrations are proportional to the administered doses.\nThe volume of distribution is approximately 0.5 l / kg.\nA small amount of pravastatin passes into human milk.\nPravastatin is not significantly metabolised by cytochrome P450 nor does it appear to be a substrate or inhibitor of P-glycoprotein but rather a substrate of other transport proteins.\nAfter oral administration, 20% of the initial dose is eliminated in the urine and 70% in the faeces. The plasma elimination half-life of oral pravastatin is one and a half to two hours.\nAfter intravenous administration, 47% of the dose is eliminated by renal excretion and 53% by biliary excretion and biotransformation. The major breakdown product of pravastatin is the 3-α-hydroxy isomeric metabolite. This metabolite possesses one-tenth to one-fortieth HMG-CoA reductase inhibiting activity of the parent compound.\nThe systemic clearance of pravastatin is 0.81 l / h / kg and the renal clearance is 0.38 l / h / kg indicating tubular secretion.\nHepatic insufficiency: Systemic exposure to pravastatin and its metabolites in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis is increased by approximately 50% compared to patients with normal hepatic function.\nKidney failure: no significant changes were found in patients with mild renal insufficiency. However, severe and moderate renal insufficiency can lead to a two-fold increase in systemic exposure to pravastatin and its metabolites.\nBased on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and reproductive toxicity, there are no other risks to the patient than those expected due to the pharmacological mechanism of action.\nRepeated dose studies indicate that pravastatin can induce varying degrees of hepatotoxicity and myopathy; in general, substantial effects on these tissues were only evident at doses 50 times or more of the maximum human dose in mg / kg.\nIn the studies in vitro and in vivo of genetic toxicology, no evidence of mutagenic potential was found.\nIn a 2-year carcinogenicity study in mice using pravastatin at doses of 250 and 500 mg / kg / day (≥ 310 times the maximum human dose in mg / kg), statistically significant increases in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in males and females and, only in females, of lung adenomas. In a 2-year carcinogenicity study in rats, at a dose of 100 mg / kg / day (125 times the maximum human dose in mg / kg), a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was demonstrated. only in males.\nLactose monohydrate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, yellow iron oxide (E172).\nNews | Page 3 of 6 | Peoria Medicine\nDrew2019-01-18T13:46:06-05:00October 16th, 2018|Categories: CIS Updates, Security Awareness|\nA research article detailing a central Illinois poison outbreak involving synthetic cannabinoids earlier this year and the therapy provided is featured in the latest issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

The Steering Group was appointed by the PCT (Primary Care Trust – forerunner to the CCG, Clinical Commissioning Group) after a public meeting in the Community Hospital. It aims to help foster good relationships between Practice and patients and to represent patients’ views and needs. BCPG works with Bishop’s Castle Medical Practice to maintain and improve health care provision in Bishop’s Castle and its environs. Additionally, BCPG is actively involved with Shropshire Patients Group which represents patients groups to the Clinical Commissioning Group which is responsible for health care provision. BCPG also works to understand NHS developments with a view to supporting health care in the area.\nAll patients are considered general members of BCPG. All active (defined as members of Steering or Task Groups) members of BCPG are volunteers. BCPG is managed by a Steering Group which sets up Task Groups as and when required. General members can join any of the Task Groups and can feed information in to the Steering Group. See BCPG Terms of Reference here.\nFollowing a very successful public meeting on 3rd February which was attended by over 100, BCPG issued the following press statement. The meeting closed with a show of hands to determine support or otherwise for the proposition put forward to establish a prototype rural Urgent Care Centre / Planned Care Centre / Community Hub: the outcome was almost unanimous with approximately 95 attendees supporting the proposition, approximately 5 abstaining and none opposing.\nA packed public meeting last night called on the NHS Future Fit Programme Board, which meets today in Shrewsbury, to back a pilot development of a fully integrated GP–led Urgent Care Centre and local planned care centre at the existing Bishop’s Castle Community Hospital.\nPatients from across southwest Shropshire and eastern Montgomeryshire heard from Dr. Bill Gowans who has led the Future Fit Clinical Model exercise and from the Bishop’s Castle Patients Group as well as the Chief Executive of the Community Hospital Trust and local doctors.\nNick Hutchins, chair of the Patients Group said “Patients recognised the tough decisions facing Future Fit but agreed that ‘one size does not fit all’ when it comes to urgent care centres. Patients called for a far more integrated local approach to health and community care, which they saw as being totally in line with NHS policy. They agreed that the planned Urgent Care Centre at Shrewsbury and possibly Ludlow would not serve the majority of patients in this deep rural cross-border area”.\nThe Patient’s Group has submitted a proposition to Future Fit for an innovative pilot Urgent Care Centre / planned care centre / community hub. It wants to see the pilot implemented progressively and with pace and not to be kicked into the long grass whilst decision are taken on the new Emergency Centre for Shropshire and mid Wales.\nBrookside Community Health Center | Healthy Low Carb\nMarch 8, 2018 Alton Morgan Comments 0 Comment\nToenail fungus is uncommon in kids, however, the probabilities becomes far more as one's age increases.

REQUIP XL may cause you to fall asleep or feel very sleepy during normal activities such as driving; or to faint or feel dizzy, nauseated, or sweaty when you stand up. Tell your doctor if you experience these or the following problems, or if you drink alcohol or are taking other medicines that make you drowsy. Side effects may include nausea, dizziness, drowsiness or sleepiness, headache, and sudden uncontrolled movements (dyskinesia). Increase or decrease in blood pressure and heart rate may occur. Hallucinations may occur at any time during treatment. Also tell your doctor if you experience new or increased gambling, sexual, or other intense urges while taking REQUIP XL. REQUIP XL may increase the side effects of L-dopa. Most patients were not bothered enough to stop taking REQUIP XL.\nREQUIP (ropinirole) is an orally administered non-ergoline dopamine agonist. It is supplied as the hydrochloride salt of ropinirole 4-[2-(dipropylamino)ethyl]-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one and has an empirical formula of C16H24N2O?HCl. The molecular weight is 296.84 (260.38 as the free base).\nRopinirole hydrochloride is a white to yellow solid with a melting range of 243° to 250°C and a solubility of 133 mg/mL in water. REQUIP XL Extended-Release Tablets are formulated as a three-layered tablet with a central, active-containing, slow-release layer, and 2 placebo outer layers acting as barrier layers which control the surface area available for drug release. Each biconvex, capsule-shaped tablet contains 2.28 mg, 4.56 mg, 6.84 mg, 9.12 mg, or 13.68 mg ropinirole hydrochloride equivalent to ropinirole 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, 8 mg, or 12 mg, respectively. Inactive ingredients consist of carboxymethylcellulose sodium, colloidal silicon dioxide, glyceryl behenate, hydrogenated castor oil, hypromellose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, maltodextrin, mannitol, povidone, and one or more of the following: FD&C Yellow No. 6 aluminum lake, FD&C Blue No. 2 aluminum lake, ferric oxides (black, red, yellow), polyethylene glycol 400, titanium dioxide.\nREQUIP XL (ropinirole extended-release tablets) is indicated for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease.\nREQUIP XL Extended-Release Tablets are taken once daily, with or without food. Taking REQUIP XL with food may reduce the occurrence of nausea; this has not been established in controlled clinical trials [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY].\nIn clinical trials, dosage was initiated at 2 mg/day and gradually titrated based on individual therapeutic response and tolerability. Doses greater than 24 mg/day have not been studied in clinical trials. Patients should be assessed for therapeutic response and tolerability at a minimal interval of 1 week or longer after each dose increment. Caution should be exercised during dose titration because too rapid a rate of titration may lead to dose selection that may not provide additional benefit, but that may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Studies]. Due to the flexible dosing design used in clinical studies, specific dose response information could not be determined.\nWhen REQUIP XL is administered as adjunct therapy to L-dopa, the concurrent dose of L-dopa may be decreased gradually as tolerated. In the placebo-controlled advanced Parkinson's disease study, the L-dopa dose was reduced once patients reached a dose of REQUIP XL of 8 mg/day. Overall, L-dopa dose reduction was sustained in 93% of patients treated with REQUIP XL and in 72% of patients on placebo. On average the L-dopa dose was reduced by 34% in patients treated with REQUIP XL [see Clinical Studies]. REQUIP XL should be discontinued gradually over a 7�Cday period.\nFollowing conversion to REQUIP XL, the dose may be adjusted depending on therapeutic response and tolerability [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION].\n2 mg: pink tablets debossed with \"GS\" and \"3V2\", in bottles of 30 (NDC 0007�C4885�C13) and 90 (NDC 0007-4885-59).\n4 mg: light brown tablets debossed with \"GS\" and \"WXG\", in bottles of 30 (NDC 0007�C4887�C13) and 90 (NDC 0007-4887-59).\n6 mg: white tablets debossed with \"GS\" and \"11F\", in bottles of 30 (NDC 0007-4883-13) and 90 (NDC 0007-4883-59).\n8 mg: red tablets debossed with \"GS\" and \"5CC\", in bottles of 30 (NDC 0007-4888-13) and 90 (NDC 0007-4888-59).\n12 mg: green tablets debossed with \"GS\" and \"YX7\", in bottle of 30 (NDC 0007-4882-13).\nSymptomatic hypotension, hypotension, postural/orthostatic hypotension\nEvents with dopaminergic therapy\nDuring the premarketing development of REQUIP XL, patients with advanced Parkinson's disease received REQUIP XL or placebo as adjunctive therapy in 1 clinical trial. In a second trial, patients with early Parkinson's disease were treated with REQUIP XL or the immediate-release formulation of REQUIP without L-dopa.\nInderal purchase — over the internet\nHowever, the final decision will always be the prescriber's. Propranolol works by blocking the effects of adrenaline. This causes your heart to beat more slowly and with less force, which lowers blood pressure.

Besides that, engineering students (undergraduate and postgraduate); engineers, research scientists/ academicians involved in the system reliability engineering and optimisation related work.\nThe Guest Editors will be inviting substantially extended versions of selected papers presented at the 4th International Conference on Mathematical Techniques in Engineering Applications, 2020 (ICMTEA2020) for review and potential publication, but are also inviting other experts to submit articles for this call.\nMy son has had Type 1 diabetes for 4 years. He is 7 years old right now. His problem is that his blood sugar readings are not stable. He may read 300 in the morning and 400 in the evening, while sometimes his readings shows 60s in the morning and 90s in the evening. You may read that his morning reading is high and the evening is too low and visa versa. He is having a mixture of Actrapid and Monotard as follows:\nmorning: 4 units of Actrapid and 16 units of Monotard;\nevening: 2 units of Actrapid and 2 units of Monotard.\nHis weight is about 27 kilos. By the way, we used to measure his blood sugar twice or thrice a day.\nIs there any kind of medicine or different type of insulin in order to stabilize his blood sugar readings?\nIs there a new device to measure the blood sugar without punching the fingers?\nIs there a possibility of transplant and what is the percentage of its success?\nYour son is probably now coming out of the honeymoon period when he will be making less of his own insulin. When the honeymoon period ends, it becomes more difficult to control the blood glucose and can be quite variable.\nIt seems as though your son is on a reasonable dose of insulin. If only dealing with insulin types and doses would solve the problem of good control, diabetes care would be really simple. Unfortunately, good control is also dependent on the routines of regular diet, exercise, timing of insulin, etc. Perhaps you might need to look at these things again to see if there is any pattern to his blood sugars. Sometimes, a food and activity diary kept along with your blood glucose readings is a useful tool at working out what is going on.\nUnfortunately, there isn't a noninvasive blood glucose monitoring device yet, but check out a thing called the GlucoWatch which may be available in the next year or so.\nFinally as far as I am aware, no one is performing pancreas transplants in children, and islet cell transplants are still experimental in adults, not done yet in children.\nWhen our mouths are healthy, they’re home to billions of bacteria, both “good” and “bad.” The “good” ones play a key role. One case in point: they convert dietary nitrates (from leafy vegetables) into nitric oxide, which helps keep our blood vessels (and, consequently, our brains) in good working order. Plus, they limit the growth of unhealthful bacteria and help protect us from harmful microbes in the food we eat.\nUnfortunately, among the roughly 700 species of microorganisms that populate the mouth, about 15-30 cause damage. These pathogens tend to accumulate when we develop gum problems and cavities. As these bad actors crowd in, they weaken our natural defenses and enter our nervous systems, bloodstreams, and guts. Their means of access? Being swallowed or pushed into the blood vessels in our gums. Once they’ve infiltrated our systems, they trigger an immune response that can affect our brains and negatively impact cognitive health.\nWhat the science says\nResearch (including a recently published review of 23 studies) supports the connection between oral health and brain health:\nA 2021 study suggested that dental cavities could increase the risk of serious brain health issues.\nPorphyromonas gingivalis, the bacteria associated with unhealthy gums, has been found in the brains of patients with significant memory deficits.\nA 2020 study published in Neurology suggested that people with severe gum issues were more likely to develop serious cognitive problems.\nA 2020 study in Molecular Psychiatry found that middle-aged and older men with higher levels of Helicobacter pylori (a bacteria associated with unhealthy gums) were more at risk of profound memory challenges.\nWatch your mouth!\nAs we age, more “bad” bacteria tend to build up in our mouths, causing inflammation. To help cull this population of unhealthy bacteria (and to discourage its travel throughout our bodies), stick to an oral care regimen. Your brain will thank you. Here’s how:\nEat a high fiber diet. A study linked the consumption of foods like fruits and vegetables to a slowdown of gum problems. More fiber means more saliva, which helps clean out the mouth.\nAt the same time, cut down on sugary foods and drinks. Sugar fuels the creation (by harmful bacteria) of acid, which destroys tooth enamel.\nRinse your mouth with water after every meal.\nAt least twice a day, brush with a soft-bristle brush and a fluoride toothpaste for a full two minutes. Make sure to clean along your gumlines. Plus, don’t forget to brush your tongue or use a tongue scraper.\nTo remove plaque and leftover food, floss regularly. Rinse afterwards.\nAvoid mouthwash, which can hinder the growth of beneficial bacteria. Products with the active ingredient, chlorhexidine, are the worst offenders. A 2020 study showed rinsing with this type of mouthwash made microbiomes more acidic and reduced the availability of blood vessel-sustaining nitrites.\nOn a regular basis, visit the dentist for a checkup and cleaning. They’ll look out for signs of trouble, like sore bleeding gums; tooth loss; and pain when chewing.\nIf you have dry mouth, your dentist or dental hygienist might recommend an in-office fluoride treatment or suggest you use a fluoride gel or mouth rinse at home.\nThe future of dental care\nAs we learn more about the link between oral and brain health, the following preventative measures could become the norm:\nDentists might evaluate our oral microbiome by screening for aggressive negative strains.\nWe could take an oral probiotic featuring the bacterium, Streptococcus dentisani. Scientists believe this microbe makes antimicrobial molecules that help kill Streptococcus mutans, a contributor to tooth decay.\nWe might brush with a toothpaste featuring arginine, which produces ammonia and lowers pH. Or we could use a product with nitrate (in salt or vegetable extract form) to feed certain “good” bacteria.\nSidebar: A quick look at the mouth microbiome\nAfter the gut, the mouth has the second largest and most diverse microbiota.\nOral microorganisms include bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa.\nDifferent bacteria populate different areas of the oral cavity.\nEvery individual has a unique oral microbiome.\nMouth microbes tend to work in teams.\nLaunched in 2010, The Human Oral Microbiome Database offers a repository of oral bacterial genome sequences, featuring 772 prokaryotic species.\nSources:\nNarengaowa, Kong, W., Lan, F., Awan, U.F., Qing, H., Ni, J.

There is therefore, widespread interest in finding natural materials that can reduce the activity of myeloperoxidase in order to minimise damage.\nA number of studies have shown that a family of small, polyphenolic compounds in green tea (known collectively as flavanols), are effective antioxidants. Ms Kajer is trying to understand the specifics surrounding this effect. Interestingly, these compounds are particular to green tea as the further processing required to make other types of tea (black, oolong, etc.) reduces the levels of these compounds.\nMs Kajer has studied the effect of these flavonoids, both individually and in combination, in an isolated (test-tube) enzyme system and also with human white blood cells. In both cases, the green tea compounds significantly reduced the activity of myeloperoxidase and the damage it causes. Importantly, this effect occurs with levels of flavanols that are present in green tea.\nThis work was most recently presented at the 16th Biennial Meeting of the Society for Free Radical Research International, London at which Ms Kajer was awarded a 'Young Investigator Award' for her presentation.\nVolume 2012 |Article ID 147614 | https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/147614\nCian McDermott, Gabrielle O'Connor, Eilish McGovern, Geraldine McMahon, \"Conservative Management of Azygous Vein Rupture in Blunt Thoracic Trauma\", Case Reports in Critical Care, vol. 2012, Article ID 147614, 3 pages, 2012. https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/147614\nA 48-year-old male was the restrained driver of a motor vehicle involved in a head-on collision with a wall at high speed. Primary survey in the Emergency Department (ED) revealed reduced breath sounds over the right hemithorax and subcutaneous emphysema of the right chest wall. The initial blood pressure measured 100/60 mmHg, and he had a pulse rate of 84 beats/minute.\nChest radiography revealed a widened mediastinum, bilateral pulmonary contusions, and multiple rib fractures (Figure 1). The patient was resuscitated with intravenous crystalloid solution and blood to maintain haemodynamic stability. A 32-Fr thoracostomy tube was inserted in the right pleural cavity with an output of 250 mL of blood with minimal ongoing blood loss.\nPortable chest radiograph showing a right-sided haemothorax and a widened mediastinum (bilateral chest drains inserted).\nWhole body-computed tomographic (CT) imaging demonstrated a right-sided haemopneumothorax with extensive pulmonary contusions and multiple ipsilateral rib fractures. There was a mediastinal haematoma present in the right paratracheal area at the position of the azygous vein (Figure 2). Imaging of the head, abdomen, and pelvis were negative for further injury. Following orotracheal intubation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for close observation. He was successfully stabilised with crystalloid and blood infusion, and he did not require exploratory thoracic surgery.\nCT Thorax with a right-sided paratracheal haematoma at the level of the azygous vein (see arrow).\nBlunt thoracic trauma accounts for 25% of trauma-related mortality. Injury to the heart and great vessels of the thorax as a result of abrupt deceleration are recognised causes of immediate death [1]. Although an uncommon complication of blunt thoracic trauma, rupture of the azygous vein is associated with potentially life-threatening haemodynamic shock in 85% of cases [2]. The clinical pattern may be indistinguishable from injury to other great vessels.\nThe initial clinical presentation of a ruptured azygous vein is that of shock with acute hypovolemic loss into the right thoracic cavity. A right-sided haemothorax is the most common finding on a primary survey chest radiograph. The presence of a widened mediastinum and/or a haemothorax is of diagnostic significance and is usually attributed to disruption of the aorta or its major branches. However, these findings may also occur as a result of azygous vein disruption. Diagnostic computed tomographic scans of the thorax to determine the cause of mediastinal widening is indicated, if the patient is haemodynamically stable.\nAzygous vein injury in blunt thoracic trauma is most often a result of sudden decelerating forces such as those involved in motor vehicle accidents or falls from a height [3–5]. The azygous vein is most commonly torn at its arch, just proximal to the junction with the superior vena cava [4] (Figure 3). It is postulated that several different aetiologic mechanisms of injury may be involved. Rupture of the azygous vein may result from abrupt deceleration applied to the mobile azygous arch which may initiate shearing forces within the thorax [6, 7]. Also, an associated anterior dislocated fracture of the upper thoracic vertebrae in the proximity of the azygous vein may contribute to venous disruption [2, 4, 8]. This may have been the mechanism of injury in our patient who had also sustained a stable thoracic vertebral body fracture.\nSchematic diagram illustrating the anterior and posterior attachments of the azygous vein (reproduced with permission from Annals of Thoracic Surgery).\nThe management of a patient with a traumatic injury to the azygous vein involves rapid evaluation and resuscitation in ED in accordance with advanced trauma life support principles [1]. When suggestive clinical features or plain film abnormalities are detected in the haemodynamically unstable patient, then immediate surgical thoracotomy may prove lifesaving [2–7]. Right-sided tube thoracostomy is generally indicated for the management of a right haemothorax [2–4, 7]. An isolated contained tear of the azygous vein may respond to conservative management due to low venous pressure and intact mediastinal pleura. For the patient who is haemodynamically stable, aortography, transoesophageal echocardiography, and CT imaging of the thorax are the imaging modalities of choice to evaluate the associated aortic injuries [9].\nWall et al. described a series of 22 penetrating injuries to the azygous venous system over a 40-year period; all of these cases were managed by exploratory thoracotomy [10]. Nguyen and Drac presented a literature review of all previously reported blunt traumatic azygous vein injuries [11, 12]. Similarly, in all of these cases, operative intervention has been required to control intramediastinal haemorrhage. Our patient is unique because he did not require a thoracotomy. Thus, it represents the first recorded case in the literature outlining a successful conservative approach to the management of acute traumatic azygous vein rupture.\nA high index of clinical suspicion is crucial for the timely detection of an azygous vein lesion. The injury may remain occult and may have potentially catastrophic consequences if the diagnosis is delayed or missed. As with all traumatic injury, the emergency physician is important in suspecting the initial diagnosis and initiating appropriate life-saving treatment. Thus, awareness of this rare condition with early diagnosis and active aggressive management may improve eventual patient outcome.\nD. A. Butler, R. F. Schneider, and M.

        "description": "Ohio born, Fontana is a master at using urban landscapes to generate sound and has been sculpting sound on different landmark locations for the past 34 years. Harmonic Bridge uses the natural oscillations of the Millennium Bridge in London, and amplifies them with accelerometers into the two ends of the bridge, one being the Tate Modern Art Gallery the other Southwark Station of the London Underground.\nEach and every footfall or the strumming of the high tensile wires holding the bridge aloft have been caught by a multitude of vibration sensors attached at different parts of the bridge. The sound when fed back to the two ends is made to accommodate the acoustics of the Turbine running at the Tate, and the open spaces of the station. A haunting experience, if ever.\nLast December, Bill ran an installation “Spiralling Echoes” on the Rotunda of the San Francisco City Hall, using a highly focused and directional Ultrasound beam, run off against the surfaces of the dome, different audible peaks would emerge changing in tune with the architecture of the dome.\nWhile most installations tend to be packed up and disposed by the artists, the Silophone remains behind as a monument to general eeriness and a larger than life collaboration of the Internet, disembodied echoes and architecture.\nTo put it simply, the Silophone is an abandoned Silo in Montreal, Canada which was put to good use as a giant echo chamber to be fed with the voices and tunes of hundred upon hundreds of enthusiasts. Compositions can be uploaded via the website or by dialing their number, resulting in one rambling echo bouncing of rusted columns and disused shafts as it winds its way down.\nEach echo has a deep resonance thanks to the acoustics of Creepy Old Buildings INC, sounding almost as if someone ripped apart a curtain. . . to a time far back in the building’s history, until it fades away again into the mist of time. Up till the next set of calls, that is.\nThe exhibit seeks to draw attention to the disused grain elevator, Silo No. 5 and find an appropriate use for it in the current context. It’s currently maintained by the Silophone Organisation.\nTo play a tune, users can simply go to the playlist on the website and click on ‘Play Silophone’, click on any of the tracks listed to play. The sounds take a while to load, and make sure you click on the ‘Hear Silophone’ icon first. Upload your own recording (1 MB and below) in a .MP3 or .WAV format, and let the spine tingling begin.\n\nI expected to enjoy this, but I was surprised by just how much; a second viewing did nothing to lessen that, and this is easily the best X-Men film. Crucially, it really doesn't miss the previously pervading presence of Wolverine. Part of that is undoubtedly due to the vitality that McAvoy and (particularly) Fassbender bring to Professor X and Magneto. Singer's X-Men unfortunately relegated the characters to luvvie thesps trading intellectual ripostes; here there's real emotion underlying the action (and, really, McKellen always seemed like an old man playing a superhero; Stewart was always an ageless baldy).\nThe first 45 minutes is flawless as an introduction to the characters, and Fassbender is really the star. But mention should be made of the delectable Jennifer Lawrence, whose conflicting loyalties form the bridge between the disparate views of Xavier and Erik. Of the other actors, I'd definitely salute Nicholas Hoult as Frank McCoy, a rare example of a child actor who has seemingly effortlessly made the transition to rather superior adult thesp. Of the rest, Kevin Bacon enjoys being the big nasty, January Jones is well-cast as the remote, glacial crystal chick and Jason Flemyng (one of Vaughn's lucky charms) is quietly amplified as Azazel.\nMuch has been made of the Cuban Missile Crisis setting, but that's really a backdrop to the involving emotional drama (and it is involving). As to the too-much-too-soon climax, it does rather give you a don't-need-another-film link to X-Men, but I'd much rather see McAvoy and Fassbender at war for a couple of sequel/prequels. Even better, sign up Fassbender as the next Bond now, and get Vaughn to direct; the latter's come on in leaps and bounds since Layer Cake and I really wouldn't have been aware of the immensely tight production time on this if I didn't know about it. Kudos all round.\n\nThe laminated piston ring offers important advantages such as unbeatable efficiency and thermal shock resistance\n• The unique piston locking, timing gear and bearing set-up as well as the limited number of parts add up to a very robust design with long service life and,\n• The 40° angle between shaft and cylinder barrel allows for a very compact, lightweight motor/ pump.\n• The pump version has highly engineered valve plates for increased self priming speed and low noise, available with left and right hand rotation.\n• The F11's and F12's have a simple and straight-forward design with very few moving parts,making them very reliable motors/pumps.\n• Our unique timing gear design synchronizes shaft and cylinder barrel, making the F11/F12 very tolerant to high 'G' forces and torsional vibrations.\n\nFlexible learning: Delivered online using scheduled remote tutorials and workshops coupled with directed study, enabling students to simultaneously maintain professional roles in clinical practice or manage other commitments whilst completing their studies.\nDelivered in partnership with the National Institute for Prevention and Cardiovascular Health (NIPC): This partnership enables an exceptional opportunity for students to interact with leading experts as well as engage in cutting-edge research and further opportunities in cardiovascular disease prevention and rehabilitation.\nThis course is delivered by an interdisciplinary teaching faculty of leading experts and clinical specialists in cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation:\nSpecialist physiotherapist in cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation.

Some people have a genetic mutation of the protein which is called factor V Leiden. This is a disorder that can cause a condition known as thrombophilia.\nIf you have the factor V Leiden mutation, you are at greater risk of developing blood clots. This abnormal clotting most commonly occurs in either the deep veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis), or in the lungs (pulmonary embolism). Not everyone who has factor V Leiden experiences abnormal clotting, but there is a higher risk for those that do.\nBecause deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are serious enough to be life threatening, if you suspect that you have the genetic mutation of factor V, factor V Leiden, you should be tested to determine your risk factor for thrombophilia. Because factor V Leiden is a hereditary condition, you may have an increased chance of having it if you have a relative with factor V Leiden. It is also more common for Caucasians of European descent to have this factor V mutation.\nIn order to find out if you have factor V Leiden, a screening can be done by taking a sample of your blood to test for activated protein C resistance. A positive result may mean that you have the factor V Leiden mutation. If you or your health care provider suspect that you may be at a higher risk for factor V Leiden, you may need more information about whether your Medicare benefits cover testing.\nSymptoms of Thrombophilia Caused by Factor V Leiden\nIf you have a mutation in your F5 gene, this causes factor V Leiden thrombophilia. It does not affect everyone who has the mutation, but it can cause problems with your blood's coagulation factor V.\nBecause thrombophilia most commonly causes abnormal blood clots in the legs and lungs, it is important to know some of the signals that indicated these conditions.\nFor deep vein thrombosis, the signs may include:\n• Pain in the effected leg\n• Redness and/or skin warmth\nIf a clot has moved into the lungs, you may have the following symptoms:\n• Severe shortness of breath that comes on suddenly\n• Chest pain that occurs when drawing in breath\nStatistics indicate that factor V Leiden is the most common inherited form of thrombophilia in the United States and Europe among Caucasians. Fortunately, Medicare recipients have coverage for the necessary blood test needed to screen for this condition.\nMedicare Coverage for Factor V Leiden Testing\nUnder both Original Medicare Parts A and B, your Medicare benefits offer coverage for blood tests that your health care provider orders to diagnose or monitor a condition or a disease. These blood tests must be medically necessary for Medicare recipients to receive coverage.\nIf you are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, you have the same coverage that you would have through Original Medicare Parts A and B, but many plans provide additional coverage for blood exams in many cases. Part A (hospital insurance) covers the cost of your Factor V Leiden screening test if your physician deems it medically necessary and orders it while you are being cared for as an inpatient or in a skilled nursing facility. Part B (medical insurance) covers 100 percent of the cost of a medically necessary blood test if your health care provider orders it as part of your outpatient care in a medical clinic or doctor's office setting. The blood test must be Medicare-approved and the laboratory performing the test must accept Medicare assignment.\nWatermelon can significantly reduce blood pressure in overweight individuals while at rest and while under stress, according to a new study.\nMore people die of heart attacks in cold weather because the stress of cold temperatures causes blood pressure to increase. The heart has to work harder to pump blood into the aorta, and that leads to less blood flow to the heart. Researchers from Florida State University conducted a 12-week study to determine if amino acids from watermelon could reduce the risk.\nParticipants took the extracts or a placebo for six weeks. They then switched treatments for six more weeks. The participants also stopped taking blood pressure medication and did not make any changes regarding diet or exercise during the study. Tests included simulated cold weather conditions. The results showed positive impacts on aortic blood pressure and related vascular parameters.\nSources\n\"Chowing Down on Watermelon Could Lower Blood Pressure,\" Florida State University, 3/25/14\nfacebook\ntwitter\npinterest\nreddit\ntumblr\nemail\nprint\nAbout\nArticles\nRecipes\nWellness Tools\nEvents & Classes\nReviews\nEducational Content (c) 2010-2022 Taste For Life.

She simply notes that they \"don't have the luxury of time or the energy to play insurers' games.\"\nIn fact, stresses Mariam Tariq, insured individuals stricken with cancer should flat-out never be placed in a position where they are left dangling helplessly by a \"power imbalance between patients and insurers.\"\nTariq obviously survived her often deadly breast cancer diagnosis. The facts surrounding her experience suggest that she did so owing solely to her own perseverance unaided by any reasonable or cooperative conduct of her insurance company, UnitedHealthCare.\nThat entity actually denied her recommended treatment repeatedly. And it did so over her doctors' collective opinion that a long-recognized therapy they prescribed would be an optimal response to her cancer.\nFortunately, the proton beam therapy strongly endorsed by her medical team was ultimately seen as being wholly appropriate by insurance regulators in her state. They overruled UnitedHealthCare after a protracted timeframe marked by the company's unflagging resistance to providing coverage deemed by Tariq's doctors as being superior to traditional radiation treatment.\nTariq hasn't forgotten the experience. She now serves as an advocate for the Alliance for Proton Therapy Access organization, after recently being a legislative intern in Washington, D.C.\nHer efforts and those of a wide swath of other reformers now focus on forging change in the insurance realm. Her stated personal mission is \"to hold insurers accountable for providing cancer patients access to the treatments they need.\"\nSafe Use of Artificial Optical Radiation Light Sources Policy Standard\nInformation Sheet: Managing UV Light Risks Generated by Science-based and Engineering Equipment\nThe greatest risks to health are probably from:\nUV radiation from the sun. Exposure of the eyes to UV radiation can damage the cornea. The effects on the skin range from redness, burning and accelerated ageing through to various types of skin cancer.\nThe Control of Artificial Optical Radiation at Work Regulations came into force on 27 April 2010. The Regulations require the University to protect the eyes and skin of persons from exposure to hazardous sources of artificial optical radiation (AOR). This is achieved through the risk assessment process.\nArtificial Optical Radiation includes light emitted from all artificial sources in all its forms such as ultraviolet, infrared and laser beams (excludes sunlight).\nOccupying Colleges / Schools / Departments must identify equipment / activities that could produce AOR, assess the risks to which persons are exposed; with appropriate controls then put in place to eliminate or mitigate the risk.\nNucala 100mg is approved for the use as an add-on treatment of patients with severe eosinophilic asthma in over 40 countries including the EU, US, and Japan and has been prescribed to over 18,000 patients in the US.

Major institutions around the globe are conducting new studies, and international scientific conferences are being held to discuss the developments. The potential for compounds like psilocybin is being shouted from the rooftops, and the pharmaceutical world is responding. It's why we're here. There's a great deal riding on the success of the compounds now being adapted and synthesized for medical purposes, both in terms of the outlook for patients, and the companies and investors seeking a piece of what's already being called the psychedelic renaissance. Truffle Report decided to speak with Dr. Jukka Karjalainen, chief medical officer of Cybin Corp., a life sciences company based in Toronto, about how this much-touted potential is being turned into a reality with the current wave of psilocybin clinical trials.\nDr. Karjalainen: Background and History with Psychedelic Research\nDr. Karjalainen is the Chief Medical Officer of Cybin's drug development strategy for using psilocybin to treat major depressive disorder, or MDD. Before we got too deeply involved, I asked for some information on his background. \"I'm a medical doctor and a pediatrician,\" he says, \"also a specialist in pharmaceutical medicine and general practice. I've been in research since the early 1980s, and a practicing physician for twenty-two years. I've written ninety peer-reviewed scientific articles, chapters in books, and articles for various publications over the last forty years.\" He began consulting with pharmaceutical companies in the late '80s and early '90s, becoming a research manager and later medical director. \"My interest in psychedelics goes back about twenty years now. In 2001, I was reviewing the existing psilocybin literature for a couple of pharmaceutical companies. It was interesting, but because it's a Schedule I drug, it ended up not going ahead at the time,\" he adds.\nDr. Karjalainen clarifies that he knew of a great deal of research into psilocybin, some of which went back decades, but \"everyone was afraid of taking that step forward. It hasn't been until the past less than ten years that we've been able to really re-start clinical trials with psychedelics, particularly psilocybin.\" He also mentions that, unsurprisingly, he considers psilocybin's classification to be unjustified. \"Schedule I is considered to have a high potential for abuse, increased suicide risk, and no known medical potential. Psilocybin is just the opposite. It's the other way around.\"\nPsilocybin as a Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder: 'The Only Compound I Know'\nWith background out of the way, I wanted to know more about his work with Cybin, and asked about the choice they'd made, in contrast with other psychedelic drug developers, to focus specifically on treating MDD with psilocybin. \"Major depressive disorder is the second largest treatment market in the world, after cardiac diseases,\" he answers. \"It's huge. And the current antidepressants are not optimal. There's not a good treatment. There's a lot of side effects, a lot of issues with antidepressants. The patients are not happy, the doctors are not happy, nobody is happy. You have to take them every day, multiple times a day. The risk of suicide for people under the age of twenty-five taking antidepressants is significantly elevated with black-box warning in each product.\"\nBroadening the scope of his answer to psilocybin research, Dr. Karjalainen explains, \"This is the first targeted medication in development, that has already shown in the early phases of research and trials to be clinically efficacious for so many indications.\"\n– Cancer-related anxiety and depression\n– A wide range of eating disorders\n– Different types of headaches\n– And in particular, promising results in treating substance abuse, including alcohol, opioids, smoking, and cocaine\n\"This is the only compound I know, in the lifespan of the entire pharmaceutical industry, that can potentially treat such a vast number of indications, so many diseases. The next closest are some oncology compounds, drugs that affect three, four, maybe five different types of cancers. That's it,\" Dr. Karjalainen tells Truffle.\nIt's reason enough for any doctor.\nSublingual Films as a Delivery System\nCarrying on with our conversation, I wanted to bring us back to Cybin's focus. At this point, they're developing sublingual strips to act as a synthetic psilocybin delivery system. I asked about that choice. \"They aren't exactly strips,\" Dr. Karjalainen says, \"more of a thin film. And there are a few different reasons for us going that way. In the clinical trials, what's been used is a 25 mg oral capsule, and this has to go through the stomach and intestinal tract before being absorbed into the liver.\" He goes on to explain that when compared to sublingual delivery directly to the bloodstream, between fifty and sixty percent of the active ingredient is metabolized through first-pass liver metabolism.\n\"There have been studies that have shown the effects of delivering psilocybin intravenously, in which a 1 mg dose can be equivalent to a 10-20 mg dose delivered orally. This will lead to many benefits. Synthetic psilocybin at the moment is quite expensive to manufacture. The actual cost of the treatment per dose will be reduced very significantly with oral film dosing. The absorption rate and ultimate bioavailability for oral capsules are also quite variable, with some having thirty percent bioavailability, some as high as sixty percent. Patients could get a higher or lower dose than intended, and the treatment could be ineffective. Circulation of the active ingredient with the sublingual film is much more stable. It's the best option for consistency of dose and control of side effects. Then there are the patients. Patients who have these conditions may not want to take the capsules or tablets in public. The film requires no water to ingest, and is very discreet.\"\nPsychedelic Clinical Trials vs. Conventional, and Early Results\nAt this point, we'd spoken quite a bit about Cybin's clinical trials. I wanted to hear more from Dr. Karjalainen about how psychedelic clinical trials functioned compared to the rest of the pharmaceutical industry. \"It's been very smooth,\" he tells me. \"This research has actually been going on since the 1960s, and we understand the effects very well with an oral dose, we understand that the lower sublingual dose is more stable. In the oral capsule, we see some hallucinatory side effects, minor headaches lasting a few hours, all very manageable. We've had rarely serious adverse effects. It's a big difference from testing many other drugs. Other than that, effects on blood have not shown any real safety concerns, and patients are followed up observing how the patient is doing, how the treatment is working.\"\n\"At the present,\" he tells me, \"we have many different internationally recognized efficacy scales, and safety scales as well.\" He references the commonly used MADRS, which is physician-recorded, and BDE-II, which is patient-recorded, among others. \"They are all showing us something quite remarkable. With antidepressants, you have to take them every day. Even when successful, it usually takes between five to eight weeks for the clinically targeted effect to appear. The other problem being that over six months, most patients lack efficacy and must switch from one product to another and in fact, more than seventy-five percent of patients stop taking antidepressants. The negative side effects also make use of antidepressants very unsatisfactory. Whereas with psilocybin patients, in clinical trials, we've seen the treatment have a positive effect on depression, anxiety, all kinds of other symptoms, with one single dose. It's very exceptional. There are certain types of genetic treatments, therapies, that you only have to do once, but for any regular therapeutic it's usually dosed every day. It's very rare for it to last so long from one dose given at the clinic.\"\nThe Patients/Psilocybin Treatment\nIt sounds promising, but it's not a surprise. Psychedelic therapies and pharmaceuticals have gained impressive momentum in recent years precisely because of results such as these. With that in mind, I wanted to understand more about how Dr. Karjalainen decides whether or not a patient is eligible for treatment, and goes about administering the psilocybin. \"Obviously the clinical trials are different from the real world,\" he says. It's a fair point to begin on. None of us know yet exactly what legally administered psilocybin therapy might look like in its eventual form. At best, we have educated guesses based on similarities in trial models.\n\"We recruit patients with a certain scale of major depressive disorder. They must, of course, consent to the study, and they cannot use antidepressants. The dose is given, and the patient is observed in the clinic for six to eight hours. That may change when we have more clinical data available. For now, we keep them in a quiet environment, accompanied by a nurse, and we monitor for hallucinogenic effects. Many patients do not have any, but for those that do it's usually transitory, lasting an hour or two. There could also be a headache lasting an hour or so, a slight increase in blood pressure. All mild, and expected. I consider this therapy very justifiable for treating someone for four, five, six months with a single administration, as opposed to daily antidepressants.\"\nOutlook for Psilocybin Clinical Trials and Parting Thoughts\nAs we began to wind down, I asked Dr. Karjalainen how he envisioned the first wave of legal psilocybin pharmaceuticals being rolled out to patients and consumers. \"For me, quite understandably, the first wave would be in the countries where psilocybin has been around for ages, not criminalized. Jamaica, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, we have fourteen countries that we're looking at. However, it looks like the FDA and Health Canada are moving forward. More so the FDA. They've issued Breakthrough Therapy designation to COMPASS Pathways and the Usona Research Institute. Cybin will also be seeking breakthrough status for the sublingual film delivery system.\"\nIt's not surprising that the regulatory hurdles for medicalized psilocybin, once so daunting, are beginning to come down. I suspect most of us can think of someone in our lives who suffers from one or more of the conditions listed earlier. Comparing the described side effects of psilocybin trial patients with the average side effects of antidepressants, or many other medications currently on the market, should leave little doubt in anyone's mind that this work is worth pursuing.\nWhile I'm not sure what precisely my expectations were going into this interview, I can say that the biggest surprises for me, going into a talk about psychedelic drug development, turned out to be that there weren't any. In clinical trials at least, synthetic psilocybin is performing as expected, living up to its described potential, and, if I understand Dr. Karjalainen correctly, going better and more smoothly than most drug trials in the ordinary pharmaceutical world. Truffle Report is looking forward to speaking with other drug developers, academic institutions, legal scholars and thought leaders in the psychedelic space about what exactly the end result could look like.\nIn the interest of complete transparency, we'd like to disclose here that Cybin is a client of Truffle Report's parent company, Puff Digital. Cybin did not pay for, sponsor, or solicit this interview in any way. It's our intention in the future to ask the same sort of questions to as many other psychedelic drug developers as are willing to speak with us, and to give our readers as complete a picture as possible of the multifaceted field of drug development within the medical psychedelic space.\nIs History of Squamous-Cell Cancer a Marker of Poor Prognosis in Patients with Cancer | OncoLink\nSource: Annals of Internal Medicine, 131(9): 655-659, November 1999.\nPrécis: A study from Sweden claimed that a history of squamous-cell skin cancer appeared to be associated with a significant greater risk for death related to second cancers.\nIt is known that people who have previously had a squamous-cell skin cancer are at increased risk for developing other types of non-skin cancers. However, what we don?t know is whether people who have a history of squamous-cell skin cancer in the past do worse when they develop second cancers compared with people who develop these same cancers but never had skin cancer. This population-based Swedish Cancer Registry study was designed to answer this question.\nA total of over 400,000 patients 20 to 99 years of age in the Swedish Cancer Registry who had a diagnosis of cancer of the colon, breast, prostate, or lung; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; or chronic lymphocytic leukemia between 1958 and 1996 were studied.\nPatients with a history of squamous-cell skin cancer had significantly increased relative risk for death following a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer or prostate cancer compared with patients who had the same cancer types without a history of skin cancer.\nA history of squamous-cell skin cancer appeared to be associated with a significant greater risk for death related to second cancers. The mechanism remains unclear. These results may not apply to persons outside of Sweden or to people with types of cancers other than the ones studied.\nTratamiento del cáncer de piel (PDQ®) (Health professionals) Tratamiento del cáncer escamoso metastásico de cuello con tumor primario oculto (PDQ®) (Health professionals) Tratamiento del cáncer de piel (PDQ®) (Patients) Tratamiento del carcinoma de células de Merkel (PDQ®) (Patients) Tratamiento del cáncer escamoso metastásico de cuello con tumor primario oculto (PDQ®) (Patients)\nPromotes Cardiovascular Health: A 2013 study published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology reports that CBD protects against the vascular damage caused by a high glucose environment, inflammation or the induction of type 2 diabetes in animal models.\nAnd CBD proved to reduce the vascular hyperpermeability (which causes leaky gut) associated with such environments.\nRecent studies suggests that cannabidiol is safe, no cbd oil side effects and non-toxic in humans and animals.\nAnd according to this review, high doses of up to 1,500 mg/day of CBD seem to be well tolerated in human body.\nAnd a study published by Argentinian researchers in 2006 revealed that cannabinoid receptors both (type 1 and 2) are present in the submandibular glands that are responsible for producing saliva in the body.\nAlso, the activation of these receptors will alters the salivary production in the body which leads to mouth dryness which is also known as “cotton-mouth”.\nOf course, depression is a serious condition that may require medical treatment and supervision, and relying on self-medication isn’t always effective.\nAlso, it can be useful, but don’t hesitate to seek professional help if you are not experiencing relief from your symptoms or find that they are getting worse.\nTHC free CBD oil products are usually either broad spectrum because they have an array of cannabinoids and terpenes but no THC oil or isolates, crystalline isolate exclusively contains CBD.\nSo, CBD oil does not get you high since it has been specifically produced to minimize THC count (the stuff that gets you high).\nLearn more about the best cbd oil for depression, benefits and uses of Pure CBD oil, cbd oil for sale.\nYou must pay shipping and processing fee of $4.97 to send you a full 30 day supply of CDX Labs CBD Oil.\nYou will have 10 days to try the product plus 5 days for shipping, for a total of 15 days from your original order date to see if CDX Labs CBD Oil is right for you.\nIf you are unhappy with cbd during those 15-days, call the CDX Labs Customer Service to cancel your order.\nAnd to avoid cbd oil scam, we recommend that you order directly from the manufacturer’s website to avoid imitation.\nCreating community impact: Celebrating 10 years of MedLINCS - Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry - Western University\nCreating community impact: Celebrating 10 years of MedLINCS\nTwo hours northeast of London, the picturesque town of Walkerton, Ontario appears out of a patchwork of rural farming fields and rolling hills. The tranquil Saugeen River snakes its way around the outer edge of heritage buildings, bringing an element of natural charm to the town of roughly 5,000 people.\nThis is Dr. Amanda Wilhelm's, MD'14, home community, and the allure of the lifestyle she grew up with here has called her back to the Grey-Bruce region to complete her medical residency. \"I can't imagine living anywhere else,\" she said. \"I love the sense of community and belonging.\"\nBut childhood memories and an idyllic setting aren't the only reasons Dr. Wilhelm has returned to area. As a former participant in the Medical Learning in Community Settings (MedLINCS) program, she credits the elective opportunity with opening her eyes to the possibilities of practising rural-regional medicine.\n\"I don't think you can ever underestimate the importance of that first clinical exposure,\" she explained. \"I'm practising the exact same type of medicine I learned my summer in MedLINCS.\"\nAn elective for first and second year Schulich Medicine students, MedLINCS provides diverse clinical and teaching opportunities in rural medicine. And much like Walkerton, the dynamic small-town and regional communities that compose much of Southwestern Ontario are at the heart of the program.\nNow celebrating its 10th year, MedLINCS (formerly MedQUEST) has enriched learners and communities alike through a variety of partnerships and activities.\n\"After 10 years of partnering with our communities, we have learned our trainees get a richer glimpse into community practice through experiences in offices, clinics, hospitals and recurring placements with a wide variety of health care providers,\" said Dr. George Kim, assistant dean, Rural & Community Engagement. \"The students get a perspective into what 'real medicine' is all about.\"\nMedLINCS participants experience community medicine through a variety of clinical rotations with family physicians, specialists and allied health professionals. Throughout its first decade, support for Schulich Medicine learners has come from local hospitals and health centres, family health teams, emergency teams, long-term care facilities and many more.\nLearners also work collaboratively with community partners. This includes organizing the popular, week-long health career exploration camp delivered to local high school students. The goal of the camp is to develop interest for medicine and health professions in young people, creating a continuum of future learners pursuing health-related fields.\nMock disaster scenarios are a key element of this fun and formative week. Local emergency service crews, health professionals and volunteer actors stage the scenarios to create realistic portraits of how a major emergency incident would unfold.\nThe impact of these disaster scenarios has also reached beyond educating local youth, providing training and accreditation opportunities for many local EMS teams.\nAs a MedLINCS participant in 2011, Dr. Wilhelm took part in these activities, working alongside local physicians for six weeks in the Walkerton area. The program reaffirmed her notions of what rural medicine entails.\n\"Growing up in the area, my idea of what a doctor did was all encompassing,\" she said. \"My family doctor did everything and I entered medical school with the goal of doing the same. MedLINCS proved to me that it was possible.\"\nDr. Wilhelm is certainly applying the jack-of-all-trades approach to her medical career. As a resident with the Rural – Hanover Program, she works in family medicine, as well as obstetrics and emergency medicine.\nThe physicians who worked with her that first summer, Drs. Jacqueline Wong and Kristine Schipper, made a particularly powerful impression in steering her toward this path. \"My physician mentors played a bigger role than they'll ever know in my choosing family medicine and wanting to come back to the area,\" she said.\nThe second-year resident is paying this mentorship forward. She is now involved in MedLINCS from a teaching perspective, assisting with presentations and taking on Schulich Medicine students to observe her work.\n\"When I started working with first year medical students this year, I realized just how much other people shaped how I practise medicine today, so hopefully I can do the same for others,\" she said.\nThese are the types of outcomes MedLINCS is celebrating at the 10-year mark – Dr. Wilhelm is one of several former participants to return to rural Ontario to set-up practice.\nLike rolling hills and farming fields, the program has become another tie that binds Southwestern Ontario communities. After 10 years, hundreds of participants and countless community partners and volunteers, the School's responsibility and service to the wider region has been significantly strengthened.\nHelping Those Closest To You Deal With Stress\nOctober 5, 2021 Looking for the Light CBD, Family, Friends, Health and Wellbeing, Men & Womens Health, Mental Health One comment\nThe first thing that we think you should do is offer to listen. Sometimes, people who are suffering from stress just need to talk about what they are feeling. Often, coming up with a solution to help someone who is stressed out won't be possible, especially seeing as a lot of the causes are things that they don't always have the power to change. Of course, if they can change them, then you should absolutely suggest that they do. However, it is far more important that you listen to what they have to say and make them feel heard, rather than offering advice. You will often find that they know what they should do, but they still need to speak to someone about the way they are feeling. Be that person for them. Offer them your shoulder.\nWhile it may not always be possible to get rid of the thing that is stressing them out, you can still help them by finding the things that help them cope with stress better. For example, you could get them into the sport of some kind and do it together. Or, you could look into some herbal remedies that may help reduce the stress and purchase some weed pipes to make the experience a bit better. It really depends on what the person close to you finds relaxing. You've just got to remember that not everything is going to work, so don't get too frustrated when you're going through the trial and error phase.\nPrevious Post: Is Working From Home Causing You Anxiety?\nPingback: Helping Those Closest To You Deal With Stress — – Survivors Blog Here Mental Health Collaborative"

        "description": "Cough At Night | The Health and Wellness Times\nMediteranean diet reduces kids asthma risk by 78%\nNovember 6, 2008 by AnnA\nFiled under Childrens Health, Diets, Food & Nutrition\nWith 1 in 11 children currently receiving treatment for asthma it is now a very common condition – but that doesn't make it any the less worrying. We have dealt with asthma before, but some news in this week might help make life easier for some of those children, and their parents. For those who are unsure about asthma in young children, the symptoms to look out for are:\n* A cough at night\n* A cold that doesn't go away\n* A whistling sound when breathing out\nThat last symptom is particularly relevant in the UK as we apparently have the highest prevalence of severe wheeze in children aged 13-14 years than anywhere else in the world.\nNow the medical journal Allergy is suggesting a way parents can be more in control of the condition through some simple dietary changes. I have talked about the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet for heart health in adults, but now it seems it could also relieve asthma symptoms in children. In Crete, where the Mediterranean diet is the norm, an estimated 80% of the children there eat fresh fruit at least twice a day and almost that same number also have fresh vegetables twice daily as well. (Sadly the research doesn't tell us how they get them to eat so much without a fistfight) So why is it important? Well very few children in Crete have asthma or hay fever and the researchers from the University of Porto in Portugal concluded that their best asthma-fighting foods were oranges, apples, tomatoes and grapes.\nAdults on the same type of diet, who had asthma, were found to have fewer attacks and flare-ups. However, if they also included nuts in their diet at least three times a week then that produced less wheezing. A likely explanation for this is that nuts contain a lot of magnesium which helps boost your lung power.\nAVOID THIS: There was however one substance that the researchers found that would double the risk of children getting asthma and allergic rhinitis – margarine. This finding confirms what an Australian study found over 7 years ago when they first warned that the polyunsaturated fats found in many margarines can double a child's chances of having asthma.\nIf you want more information, please visit www.asthma.org.uk\nTags: apples, asthma, asthma in children, asthma symptoms in children, cold that doesn't go away, cough at night, grapes, margarine, medical journal Allergy, Mediterranean diet, oranges, tomatoes, wheeze, whistling sound when breathing out\nActipraz 40 Mg Tablet | Esomeprazole | Nexium | Precautions | Uses\nActipraz 40 Mg Tablet\nAvailability: IN STOCK SKU: CMS3774\nUse Actipraz 40 Mg Tablet to treat Gastroesophagal Reflux Disease.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a disease which is a severe form of acid reflux.

The acid's backflow irritates the food pipe lining & may cause inflammation. You may experience frequent regurgitation & heartburn, usually after eating. You may experience feeling of a lump in your throat & have difficulty swallowing. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a disease in which there is rupture in the inner lining of the stomach, 1st part of the small intestine or occasionally in the lower esophagus. An ulcer in the stomach is known as gastric ulcer, whereas that in the first part of the intestines is a duodenal ulcer. The most familiar symptoms of a duodenal ulcer are waking at night with upper abdominal pain or upper abdominal pain which improves with eating. With a gastric ulcer the pain might worsen with eating. Other symptoms may include belching, weight loss, vomiting, or poor appetite. Complications may also include bleeding, perforation & blockage of the stomach.

Furthermore, it has become necessary that most of data transported over a network are secured and protected.\nIt is therefore required to reduce the size of data by using compression algorithms, and also to reduce or even to suppress the capability of other users in the network of looking, reading and understanding the data by using encryption algorithms. Encryption may use the benefits of the compression to reduce the capability to unlock the encryption by reducing the predictability.\nData are generally encapsulated with protocols in frames or cells. Such protocols are becoming more and more complex and they introduce overhead. Besides, they need also be protected against external penetration for security. Accordingly, it is also required to use compression and/or encryption algorithms for protocols as for other data:\ncompression of the protocol may be used to reduce the overhead and facilitate the understanding in order to speed up the routing/switching over the network. Encryption may be used to reduce the visibility of the protocol (type of protocol, addresses . . . ) and the risk of intrusion.\nWide Area Networks (WAN) are the best candidates for compression and encryption although it may be interesting to use also compression and encryption on Local Area Networks (LAN) because WANs are either public networks or use public links which are very expensive and not under the protection of the entity transferring data. The three following cases are examples wherein compression and encryption should be used:\n1. Customer networks are more and more sharing the infrastructure through common protocol such as Frame Relay or IP (Internet) which introduce security problems (confidentiality, access).\nData encryption allows the exchange of sensitive data over public access networks including Internet. Protocol header encryption allows to suppress the visibility of transactions/communications and of origin/destination address names.\n2. WAN links are the slowest and most costly elements in a network. The complexity and overhead introduced by the protocols increasing over time (Ipv4 to Ipv6, Ethernet frame size, data base remote access . . . ) degrade the usability of the network.\nData and protocol header compression improves throughput over communication lines.\n3. Separate compression/encryption devices for data and headers which exist today duplicate efforts, increase latency, and introduce compatibility problems. Furthermore, there is a need on local networks because the protocol or the user are not necessarily aware that the destination is within the LAN or accessed remotely. The location where data and/or protocols are compressed or encrypted are different. Generally, a compression/encryption on data is preferably performed on end devices at application or presentation layers, before a transparent end to end data transmission is performed. On the contrary, the protocol header needs to be compressed/encrypted at each routing node in order to be correctly routed. Generally, the type of compression/encryption required for data and protocol fields are not the same. There is no need for an intermediate node to have a clear view of the data field: it is less secure and spends unnecessary computing resources.\nSome compression protocols are taking data fields into account while other ones are working exclusively on protocol headers but there is no common compatible existing protocol able to support multi-field compression/encryption control.\nUsing upper layers (application/presentation) is the easiest way to implement compression or encryption but it means that this function is only applied to that data itself and not to the various headers with their overhead. It means that it should be done on each system interfacing the network. Generally encryption of data is done by software such as ZIP, TAR . . . for compression or ViaCrypt or other similar code for encryption but involves personal activity and time/resource on each system and does not allow to perform compression at lower level. Encryption should always be done after compression. Inasmuch as Encryption randomizes the data, compression performed after encryption is not efficient. Its a good reason to move today encryption from upper layers to lower layers and after compression anyway.\nAll these drawbacks are reduced with implementation at lower layers (transport/network) especially if done by hardware to reduce compression/encryption time. At lower layers, it may be possible to compress/encrypt not only data fields but also header fields of the various protocols and to do it on the right order for better efficiency. Unfortunately, there is a limited capability on existing lower layers for the compression/encryption of the protocols which are specific and handle either header or data but never both using a similar encapsulation mechanism.\nIn addition to the reduced amount of data transmitted on the links, there are some advantages to improve both security and routing/switching time if it is not necessary to decompress each header at each network note. Some of the additional services are:\nProtecting data against reading or modification from unauthorized person.\nProtecting transaction against message suppression/insertion.\nVerifying originator of messages.\nAccordingly, the primary object of the invention is to provide a method of implementing a global encapsulation protocol able to support multiple types and fields of compression/encryption.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a compression/encryption method applying to all protocols and allowing to increase the performance of the compression rate and the transmission delay.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a new protocol able to split the various fields of a data frame by data and headers and a capability for each node to be able to manipulate, that is to compress (or decompress) and/or to encrypt (or decrypt) selected fields of the data frame.\nAccordingly, the invention relates to a process for controlling frames transporting data from a transmitting Terminal to at least a receiving Terminal through a plurality of consecutive nodes including a start access node connected to the transmitting Terminal and at least an end access node connected to the receiving Terminal and intermediary nodes, with each data frames comprising one or several protocol layers respectively associated with one or several communication protocols of controlling the frame flow at each node. The process consists in adding to each data frame a Data Manipulation Layer (DML) defining the parameters necessary for managing the manipulation (compression and/or encryption) of each field of the data frame located after the DML, and adding to each data frame a Control message for transporting a control protocol defining new parameters to be used by some ones of the plurality of nodes for managing the communication flow through the consecutive nodes.\nAccording to a characteristic of the invention, each data frame can be divided into a plurality of zones corresponding to the protocol layers located after the DML in the data frame or consecutive parts of these protocol layers and to the data block or consecutive parts of the data block, wherein each zone comprises a first sub-zone containing a manipulated data header (MDH) defining the parameters of the following compressed and/or encrypted data, and a second sub-zone containing data (MD) which have been compressed and/or encrypted according to the parameters defined in the first sub-zone.\nAccording to another characteristic of the invention, the parameters defined in the Control message enable to determine the function assigned to each node, so that the node may have the function of:—Access Node interfacing directly the transmitting or receiving Terminal, such an Access Node generating the DML if it connected to the transmitting Terminal and removing the DML if it is connected to the receiving Terminal,\nProtocol Node for the nodes which may only have access to some manipulated headers but have no access to the data, and\nNetwork node for the nodes which have no access to headers or data the Frame supervisor.\nThe invention relates also to a Data Manipulation Layer (DML) added to a data frame transmitted from a transmitting Terminal to at least a receiving Terminal through a plurality of consecutive of at least a data transmission network (WAN) with the data frame comprising one or several protocol layers respectively associated with one or several communication protocols for controlling the frame flow at each node, and comprising a Frame supervisor defining the protocol to be used with the data included in the data frame, the flow identification (Flow ID) and the frame sequence number, a Control message defining new parameters to be used by some ones of the plurality of consecutive nodes for managing the communication flow in the network, and a DML frame header in front of the DML defining the contents of the DML.\nThese and other features, objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent upon a consideration of the following detailed description of the invention when read in conjunction with the drawings in which:\nFIG. 1 shows a schematic block-diagram of a transmission path from a Terminal DTE 1 to a Terminal DTE 2 over a wide area network (WAN) wherein the invention may be used.\nFIG. 2 shows schematically the structure of the Data Manipulation Layer (DML) according to a preferred embodiment of the invention.\nFIG. 3 shows schematically the structure of a data frame wherein protocol headers or data fields are divided into blocks for which different manipulation protocols may be used in accordance with the invention.\nFIGS. 4a, 4 b, and 4 c represent the structure of the data frame wherein the DML which is not located in front of the frame may be shifted after other protocol layers.\nFIG. 5 shows a schematic block-diagram of a transmission path wherein DML nodes coexist with standard routing nodes.\nFIG. 6 shows a schematic block-diagram of a multipoint transmission configuration wherein a DML node can be an Access node or a Protocol node depending upon the destination of the path.\nIn a general way, the invention can be implemented in a wide area network (WAN) as illustrated in FIG. 1 for the transport of data frames between a transmitting Terminal (DTE 1) and a receiving Terminal (DTE 2), but could be also implemented in a local area network (LAN) or a large network composed of WANs and LANs. As shown in FIG. 1, DTE 1 transmits clear data to the first node accessing the network which transforms the clear data into compressed and/or encrypted data between NODE 1 and NODE 6. Reciprocally, the into compressed and/or encrypted data is transformed into clear data between NODE 6 and the receiving Terminal DTE 2.\nThe invention consists in adding a protocol layer in front of the existing protocols if supported by the network nodes or between the existing protocols in order to pass through the nodes that are not aware of the added protocol in order to coexist with the already installed protocols. Thus, it is possible to add the new protocol layer between the ATM protocol and the IP protocol or between the IP protocol and the TCP protocol or other upper layer protocols. In order to inform the upper layers of the presence of this new protocol, a mechanism such as a dedicated network layer protocol identifier is recommended.\nThe purpose of the added protocol is to define each field of the frame or cell, data as well as header, as being manipulated (compressed or encrypted or both). Thus, several compression and encryption protocols may be defined field by field. In the following description, the layer containing such a new protocol will be defined as the Data Manipulation Layer (DML).\nThe DML determines two main functions: a control protocol which defines the function of each node involved in a communication between a transmitting DTE and a receiving DTE, a DML protocol for encapsulating the data and providing pointers to all fields of the layer.\nData Manipulation Layer (DML) Protocol\nThe DML protocol is defined by several fields in the DML which are illustrated in FIG. 2. As pointers to each field are provided, each one may be handled separately. This allows to work separately on headers of protocols, the data block, or parts of the protocol headers or the data block.\nThe DML is composed of a Frame header determining the contents of the DML fields, a Frame supervisor (FS) a Control message defining the control protocol as described hereafter, a manipulated data header (MDH), a data block and a PAD necessary as words used for manipulated data (compressed and/or encrypted) are not necessarily aligned on bytes.\nDML Header Format\nThe DML Frame header includes 3 bits ABC wherein:\nA=1 when data are in manipulated mode (compressed and/or encrypted)\nA=0 when data are not in manipulated mode\nB=1 when there is a frame supervisor\nB=0 when there is no frame supervisor\nC=1 when there is a control message\nC=0 when there is no control message\n* 5 bits XXXXX indicating the number of bytes in the control message.\n* P is the parity bit of the frame header.\nNote that this way of formatting avoids from having 0 bits in fields dedicated to the Frame supervisor or to the Control message when they do not exist in the DML. However, another way would be to have always a Frame supervisor or a Control message even if they contain no significant bits.\nHereunder are the 8 cases corresponding to the different values of the ABC bits:\nData are not manipulated, and there are no Frame supervisor and no Control message. It is the way to handle transparent data which are neither compressed nor encrypted but which are using the same logical channel as manipulated data.\nData are not manipulated, and there is no Frame supervisor. There is a Control message the length of which is given by the 5 bits XXXXX. Such a Control message generated without a Frame supervisor indicates a global message that concerns all protocols involved. It can be used to define the size and contents of each Frame supervisor that may be used. It can be also used for the global setup of nodes involved in the transmission process.\nData are not manipulated, there is no Control Message and there is a Frame supervisor. As explained in detail hereafter, the Frame supervisor defines the protocol of the data included in the frame, indicates the flow identification and the sequence number identifying the sequence of the frame within this flow identification.\nData are not manipulated. There are both a Frame supervisor and a Control message. The length of the Control message is given by the 5 bits XXXXX. Such a Control message generated with a Frame supervisor indicates a message which relates only to the protocol defined in the Frame supervisor. Additionally, the Control message may concern only the flow identification defined in the Frame supervisor.\nData are compressed and/or encrypted. But there are no Frame supervisor and no Control message. Such a case corresponds to a data transmission between two Terminals which have defined a single protocol to be used in the transmission.\nData are compressed and/or encrypted. There is no Frame supervisor, but there is a Control message. Such a case is similar to the preceding one, except that a Control message is used to setup or to control the operation of the transmission nodes.\nData are compressed and/or encrypted. There is a Frame supervisor, but no Control message. After the frame supervisor, is included a manipulated data header (MDH) as illustrated in FIG. 2, which defines the characteristics of the compressed and/or encrypted data which follow the MDH field in the frame.\nData are compressed and/or encrypted, and there are both a Frame supervisor and a Control message.\nFrame Supervisor Format\nAs illustrated in FIG. 2, the Frame supervisor includes:\na Protocol field (8 bits) defining up to 246 protocols such as Ipv4, Ipv6, X.25, HDLC, Frame Relay, PPP or sub-protocols, or protocols over other protocols.\na Flow ID field (8 to 24 bits) identifying the transmission flow to which belongs the frame. It is used in addition to the protocol in order to simplify the routing/switching on those nodes that may not access to the protocol header.\na Sequence number field (4 to 8 bits) which is used to perform transmission error tracking or to synchronize aggregate flows using different paths in the network.\na Status field (4 to 16 bits) which is used for error management such a ½ window reached, ¼ error in sequence number etc.\nNote that other optional additional fields could be included in the Frame supervisor such as lifetime, segmentation or checksum fields.\nManipulated Data Header Format (MDH)\nAs illustrated in FIG. 2, the manipulated data header contains the following fields:\na Compression field (3 bits) defining up to 8 compression modes which could be supported simultaneously on one Flow ID. The Compression type may be V.24bis, LZS . . .\nan Encryption field (3 bits) defining up to 8 encryption modes which could be supported simultaneously on one Flow ID. The encryption type may be RSA, PGP, DES, IDEA, RC4 . . .\na Command field (2 to 8 bits) defining simple commands (ACK, RESET, Intermediate Init) or commands with additional fields (CRC check, dictionary update . . . )\na Data length field (6 or 14 bits) composed of one bit defining a short data length field (5 bits for 32 bytes) or a long data length field (13 for 8 Kbytes) followed by 5 or 13 bits.\nNote that each field of the frame (header or data) can be divided into several fields controlled by different protocols defining whether and how the corresponding field is compressed and/or encrypted. In such a case, there are several manipulated blocks in the frame as illustrated in FIG. 3, each block including a manipulated data header (MDH), a manipulated data (MD) and a PAD. Thus, in FIG. 3, there are two blocks. However, the number of blocks within a frame is not limited as they are chained together (for example, MDH 1 points to MDH 2).\nNote that a block could be used to compress and/or encrypt the protocol header whereas the data could be compressed and/or encrypted separately.\nData Manipulation Layer (DML) Building\nThe DML which is generated by the first network node (Access node) being directly connected to the transmitting Terminal, can be considered in several situations:\nsetup and initialization of the Network. Used when information are requested and answered generally by using the control protocol. In this step and especially at global level, the use of the additional fields is limited (MDH, MD) as they are not completely defined and checked. Only default settings may be used at that time.\nOnce a protocol is defined and default links are established, further fields of the DML may fully be used under this protocol allowing data transfer protected and encrypted if necessary between end devices (DTEs) or between nodes themselves by using control messages within a protocol.\nThe number of MDH/MD blocks depends really on the incoming data structure, the type of protocol and the type of routing/switching function to perform in the path. Additionally if, for example, firewalls are implemented within the network which will look at upper layer protocol fields such as TCP, HTTP, FTP . . . there is a need to put these headers in dedicated MDH/MD blocks in order to isolate them one side from the data and on the other side from lower layer protocols such as IP which will be used by intermediate protocol nodes that do not need to look at TCP or similar level of protocol.\nFurthermore, there is an interest to offer the capability within one frame to split the data in several data fields insofar as a single data frame may handle different kind of data: data, voice, video. Each one does not support the same kind of manipulation which leads to use corresponding manipulation mechanisms. In addition, it may be found that some part of the data is already compressed or encrypted which prevents to use efficiently any kind of manipulation on this part of data. Putting this part of data in specific MDH/MD block without manipulation while the remaining part is still compressed and/or encrypted improves significantly the performance of the global manipulation.\nThe control protocol is transported between nodes in control messages. It is used to setup these nodes along the network, to check for error, proceed to recovery and reset the nodes.\nThe control protocol works at three different levels:\n1. The global level, either logical or physical, which may include several connections using different protocols:\nAt global level, the following elements may be exchanged\nPublic Key exchange with certification in order to enable protected information exchange between the nodes.\nFrame supervisor definition, contents and size of the fields.\nData Manipulation protocols such as encryption protocols and compression protocols with their characteristics. This needs an exchange of information starting by a request from the Access node which has to know the capability of all the nodes in a network. Note that the intermediate nodes do not need to perform this kind of requests as they are not establishing connection. They will just answer to Access node requests.\nSecret encryption keys. These keys as the other information transported through the control protocol, may be themselves encrypted using a public key method such as RSA. These secret keys allows a better encryption method for large data transfers; they offer better performance than Public/private key methods. But to transmit these keys, the preferred solution is to exchange the public keys between the nodes in a first time. Then a node sends the secret key encrypted by the public key given by the destination. The receiving node can decrypt by using its private key corresponding to the public key at the disposal of the sending node. Authentication is also used as a common way to check that the provider of the key is the regular one. Either an authentication code is set (built in) in all the nodes in the network or each public key is put in a common server that will provide public keys to each requesting node.\n2. The protocol level which may include several features\nAt this level are defined the network protocols such as TCP, IP, Frame Relay, OSPF, RIP, SNMP, ATM, X.25 . . . that are supported in the network by all the nodes or a limited number of nodes.\nThe characteristics of each of the network protocols are defined so as to include the capability for each node to route or switch the protocol.\nDefault Flow ID are assigned such as connection-less IDs, management Ids.\nThe security to apply by default to each protocol.\nThe characteristics of various data compression protocols including their initialization: for example exchange of the starting compression tables/dictionaries if not empty.\nThe number of Flow IDs supported by the protocol which leads to the length of the ID-Flow field.\nIn the preferred embodiment of the invention, all the parameters set at global and protocol levels are put in a multi-protocol table which includes the following fields:\nNode names, type.\nNode addresses by protocol.\nCapability of the node for data manipulation: list of algorithm/protocols supported with pointer to their specific tables/keys.\nRouting and switching facilities by protocol.\n3. The connection level identified by a flow ID\nThe characteristics of each connection is then defined, connection by connection, when there is a need or a request to start one connection. A connection is always started by an Access Node.\nTo manage all the connections and associated Flow-IDs (at least one Flow-ID by connection) an additional Flow-ID table is implemented at node or port level, by protocol in order to manage the connections. The characteristics of each connection including the parameters related to its Quality of Service, max path length, security . . . are incorporated in this table. When the call is completed, Flow-IDs are released and can be reused. An empty field list is therefore maintained.\nA similar table can be used on intermediate nodes where Flow-IDs may have to be swapped from one port to another. In order to achieve that, an additional field is added on the above table giving the next Flow-ID to use and the destination port. Flow-ID swapping is used to reduce the number and size of IDS by link/port. Flow-ID swapping initialization and change is performed using the control protocol at connection level.\nAs illustrated in FIG. 1, the data transmission between a transmitting Terminal and a receiving Terminal using the principles of the invention can involve a plurality of nodes. These DML nodes may have different functions which divide them into three types: Access, Protocol or Network nodes\n1. Access Nodes:\nThese nodes interface directly the Terminal. They may be also integrated within the Terminal. They get and send clear data on one side from various protocols and generate on the other side the proposed protocol having multiple fields compressed and/or encrypted. They can code and decode data and header compression/encryption on the protocols they control. Node 1 and 6 are example of Access nodes.\nAn Access node is the only node where the DML is generated. It establishes connection through the network up to the final Access node destination which will remove the DML layer.\nAn access node needs to have a full view of the network to find the most appropriate route. It builds the route table and updates the various nodes in the network through the control protocol to perform the defined forwarding function (routing, switching at the appropriate level) on each node.\n2. Protocols Nodes\nThese nodes can only decode some of the header compression/encryption but have no access to the data. They can interface Access or Network nodes or standard equipment/networks to reuse standard protocol encapsulation but the data will remain protected until a node having Access node functions (data decompression/deencryption) is reached. Nodes 2 and 5 are example of Protocol nodes\nA Protocol node is able to understand a DML frame on its receive side and can access to some or all the headers which means that it can understand and decode the Manipulated Data Header (MDH) and decrypt and/or decompress the associated data which is in fact a network protocol header such as Frame-Relay or IP or IP+TCP . . .\nOn the other side (transmit side), a protocol node can perform the reverse function after having routed or switched the frame at the appropriate level. A DML is rebuilt using the same structure with updating if necessary of the various headers including the data contents of the header and its associated MDH.\n3. Network Nodes\nThese backbone nodes have access neither to the protocol header nor to the data. They have to route or switch at the Flow-ID level. They manage virtual circuits knowing their routing characteristics up to the next Protocol node but have no idea of the final destination and cannot view the data. Nodes 3 and 4 are example of Network nodes.\nA Network node may only switch or route using the Frame supervisor fields which means that it should refer to the ID to check within its local routing table to which port it should forward the frame and on which flow-ID (if this one is changed).\nThe type of node (Access, Protocol or Network) is a definition which applies either to the full device or to a port or list of ports, or to a protocol or list of protocols, or Flow-IDs. This means that a device may be simultaneously\nAccess node for some links, Protocol node for other and Network node only for the remaining links which have not been assigned to higher privilege.\nIt is possible to find Protocol nodes inside a cloud of Network nodes, and Access nodes inside a cloud of Protocol nodes. The next node in a path is not necessarily a node of the same level or a node of the level just above or under its level. Any combination is possible. An Access node includes all rights and privileges of Protocol and Network nodes while a Protocol node includes the rights and privileges of a Network node.\nCoexistence of DML Nodes with Standard Routing Nodes\nThere is no problem to implement the principles of the invention defining the DML nodes as explained above, within a network wherein there are standard routing nodes. For example, it can be assumed that a DML has to be set up just after a link protocol PPP as illustrated in FIG. 4a. In such a case, all the upper layers including IP header, TCP header and data themselves can be compressed and/or encrypted.\nThis above case can be illustrated by FIG. 5. As NODE 1 which is a standard routing node, is not able to understand the DML protocol, there is a need that a protocol (PPP) which can be routed over the network, be located in front of the frame. This applies also between NODE 2 which is a standard routing node and NODE C, and of course, between NODE 1 and NODE 2.\nA way to solve the interconnection with standard routing nodes in the case of FIG. 5 is to shift the DML to the right while the IP header is used without being manipulated as illustrated in FIG. 4b. But this solution has the drawback to increase the number of bytes to be used when it is necessary to decompress the IP header and generally also to decrypt the IP header. Note that the IP header has to set as next layer field a value that NODE C can detect to start the DML processing.\nA better approach would be to use the frame structure illustrated in FIG. 4c, where the IP header not manipulated has NODE B as source address and NODE C as destination address. This will result in an encapsulation pipe shared by several users to pass through NODE 1 and NODE 2. It looks like a tunneling function which will protect the identification of real source and destination and avoid network penetration by not authorized people.\nFIG. 6 shows an example of multipoint configuration wherein one of the destination is a standard routing node (NODE 2). The transmission path from DTE 1 to NODE D is similar to the above case in reference to FIG. 5. At NODE D, the DML may be used to forward data either to NODE E and DTE 2 or to NODE 2 and DTE 3. In the latter path, NODE D must be able to decompress and/or decrypt all layers including or not the data (depending on the capability of NODE 2); therefore, NODE D will be both an Access node for DTE 3 even though it is not directly connected thereto and a Protocol node for DTE 2.\n1.

The week is observed in June each year, in the days leading up to and including Father’s Day. This year, Men’s Health Week runs from June 13th through the 19th. People use all sorts of ways to raise awareness and creating Men’s Health Week wristbands are just a start.\nBlue is the signature color of Men’s Health Week, so many people dress in all blue during Wear BLUE day at work during the awareness week. Given that, blue wristbands can be just the thing to help raise awareness. In fact, the bands could be solid blue, color-blocked with blue and white or gray, or even blue swirled with white or gray. Any number of messages could be imprinted on the bracelets, including ones that say “Men’s health is a family issue,” “Be healthy; get screened,” or “Stay healthy; be educated.”\nAccording to WebMD, the top concerns men face are cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, prostate cancer, depression and suicide, and diabetes. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that over 300,000 men die each year from cardiovascular issues and nearly 87,000 men die from lung cancer. That’s why, during Men’s Health Week, men are encouraged to get screened and to get educated.\nAmazing Wristbands is a leading provider of customized silicone wristbands available online, including Men’s Health Week bracelets. Our wristbands are comfortable, durable, and non-allergenic, made of 100% silicone. Many of our wristbands can be created with our easy-to-use online tool.

        "description": "While it is always important for health care professionals to be fully aware of all medicines or therapies a patient is taking, it is especially important in surgical patients because of potential herbal interactions with medications and anesthetic agents used during the surgical procedure; and the potential for adverse reactions including effects on coagulation, blood pressure, sedation, electrolytes or dieresis [9, 14–22]. Patients having elective surgery are usually counseled to discontinue certain medications prior to surgery, especially anticoagulation agents, diuretics, and oral hypoglycemics. It is important for surgeons and anesthesiologists to be familiar with natural products and their perioperative implications. However, one survey demonstrated that the majority of physicians were not familiar with the side effect profiles of many herbal products and did not recommend stopping herbal medications in the perioperative period [15]. Another study evaluating the knowledge and practice of family medical residents found that, when asked to match an herbal product to a drug interaction, the mean test score was 32% [23].\nPharmacist-mediated medication reconciliation efforts at the University of Kansas Hospital (KUH) have documented preoperative use of natural products by surgical patients. The Anesthesia Preoperative Evaluation Clinic (APEC) is a clinic within KUH where patients scheduled for surgery receive a pre-surgery evaluation by a nurse and meet with a pharmacist to discuss their medications. KUH has developed a Pre-Surgical Medication Counseling Form which provides discontinuation counseling information for specified medications. The role of the pharmacist is to obtain an accurate medication history from the patient and provide recommendations for discontinuation of the patient's medications in regards to their surgical procedure. The role of the nurse is to obtain an accurate medical history from the patient and draw any necessary laboratory work and conduct an EKG, if necessary. If any EKG abnormalities are noted, or if concerns are raised about the patient's safety during surgery, an anesthesiologist will meet with the patient and address the concerns. Most patient appointments in the APEC are scheduled one week prior to surgery; however walk-in appointments are welcome.\nCurrent recommendations given to patients regarding natural product use include a statement recommending discontinuation 14 days prior to surgery. This implicates a potential problem: as noted above, most patients are scheduled one week prior to their surgery. Additionally, two of the three patient rooms had a chart which included pharmacological effects, perioperative concerns and preoperative discontinuation of specific herbs (see Table 1). However, the chart was not complete or accurate and did not provide references. In consideration of these current problems, the primary objective of this study is to identify patterns of natural product use and their potential complications among patients scheduled for surgery. Secondary objectives include improving existing medication reconciliation efforts, and developing discontinuation guidelines for the use of these products prior to surgery.\nElevation Oncology Announces the Presentation of Preclinical Data on the Specific Inhibition of HER3 to Block NRG1 Fusion Signaling - Elevation Oncology\nElevation Oncology Announces the Presentation of Preclinical Data on the Specific Inhibition of HER3 to Block NRG1 Fusion Signaling\nPreclinical Data Research NRG1 fusion HER3 Publication\n– Inhibition of HER3 by seribantumab reduces tumor volume by 50-100% in preclinical in vivo models containing an NRG1 fusion –\n– Presentation of the data at the 32nd EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics –\nNEW YORK, NY – October 26, 2020 – Elevation Oncology, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of precision medicines for patients with genomically defined cancers, announced today the presentation of preclinical data on the specific inhibition of NRG1 fusion signaling by seribantumab, a HER3 monoclonal antibody, at the 32nd EORTC-NCI-AACR Symposium on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics (Odintsov et al., 2020). The data support the scientific rationale for the Phase 2 CRESTONE study for patients with solid tumors of any origin that have an NRG1 gene fusion. The CRESTONE study is currently enrolling at sites across the US. Details on the CRESTONE study have recently been presented at both the AACR Virtual Special Conference: Pancreatic Cancer (Bendell et al., 2020) and the North American Conference on Lung Cancer (Spigel et al., 2020).\n\"The preclinical research on HER3 inhibition in disease models of cancers with NRG1 gene fusions is encouraging,\" said Igor Odintsov, MD, Research Fellow, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and lead author of the abstract, who performed this study with Romel Somwar, PhD, in The Marc Ladanyi Lab at MSK. \"The data demonstrate that treatment with seribantumab results in decreased phosphorylation of not only HER3 but also its dimerization partners HER2, HER4, and EGFR, and downstream PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, suggesting efficient inhibition across HER3 and the entire ERBB signaling pathway. Administration of seribantumab resulted in significant tumor shrinkage of tumors that contain an NRG1 gene fusion in in vivo models of lung and ovarian cancer with an approximately 50% and 90-100% tumor reduction, respectively. These results support the potential of HER3 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy in patients that have tumors harboring an NRG1 fusion.\"\nSeribantumab's primary mechanism of action in the NRG1 fusion model is through inhibition of ligand-dependent activation of HER3 (also known as ERBB3). Seribantumab also interferes with the dimerization of HER3 with other ERBB family members and blocks the phosphorylation of all ERBB family members and activation of the PI3K and MAPK downstream signaling pathways.\n\"Precise therapy development is needed to ensure that patients and their physicians have treatment options that make their genomic test results actionable,\" said Lori Kunkel, MD, Chair of the Elevation Oncology Scientific Advisory Board. \"These data outline the scientific rationale for targeted inhibition of HER3 when an NRG1 gene fusion is detected. The specific inhibition of HER3 with the monoclonal antibody seribantumab results in significant tumor reduction and sustained disease control in models of cancers driven by an NRG1 gene fusion. These preclinical results are now being clinically evaluated in the Phase 2 CRESTONE study for patients with solid tumors harboring an NRG1 gene fusion.\"\n\"Seribantumab demonstrates significant activity in preclinical models through the destabilization of HER3 and the entire ERBB signaling pathway,\" said Shawn Leland, PharmD, RPh, Founder and Chief Business Officer of Elevation Oncology. \"In tumors with an NRG1 fusion, HER3 signaling activated by NRG1 fusion proteins is most often the unique oncogenic driver. It is critical for patients to have the appropriate genomic test to detect the presence of an NRG1 fusion and we have partnered with multiple diagnostic companies, major academic centers and community practices to expand access to the CRESTONE study. We believe that this collaborative approach offers the best opportunity to identify patients who may benefit from treatment with seribantumab and allows us to meet them where they are, especially during the time of COVID-19 where immunocompromised patients with cancer are reluctant to travel.\"\nDiagnostic partnerships will enhance traditional patient enrollment in the CRESTONE study through real-time, nationwide identification of NRG1 fusion positive patients within the Ashion Analytics, Strata Oncology, Tempus, Caris Life Sciences, and US Oncology Research partner networks. Through the various partnership models, patients may also be enrolled in CRESTONE either through active referral to current strategic sites or \"just-in-time\" site initiation within the partner networks.\nThank you for your business!You should be receiving an order confirmation from Paypal shortly.Exit Shopping Cart\nCCHAP Meals on Wheels Program!\nToggle Navigation\nHome\nAbout\nContact\nStore\nCOVID-19 Statement\nHome\nAbout\nContact\nStore\nCOVID-19 Statement\nA food delivery service in Cleveland Ohio offering nutritious meals to those in need.\nA Program of Collaboration Station, a 501c3 nonprofit organization\nLEARN MORE\nCCHAP Meals\nDelivering meals to those with physical disabilities and to individuals with chronic or acute health conditions who need healthy, home-cooked, nutritious meals prepared for them.\n1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW\nCCHAP Meals\nIn addition to home delivered meals, our agency provides assistance to those in need of Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) through our licensed Dietitian on staff\n+012 345 6789\n​CCHAP Meals\nDelivers Meals On Wheels to ages 22 and older to ensure they have healthy, nutritious food to eat at home.

As a result, ovaries become inflamed and develop cysts, which further result in irregular menstrual periods. Women who face pregnancy failure due to PCOS and ovulatory dysfunction is often recommended Androxal (Clomiphene) to rule out this condition. It can temporarily correct the ovulation process in women dealing with infertility.\nHow to use Androxal?\nThe doctor will ask you to start clomiphene orally on either day of your menstrual cycle. One pill needs to be taken for five days. Ovulation often occurs between 13-18 days of your cycle. In case, one's fails to ovulate, the doctor may increase the dosage.\nClomiphene is often taken in combination with other medicines to induce mensuration and ovulation in women who do not have a fixed menstrual cycle.\nWhat if I miss the dose of Androxal (Clomiphene)?\nIt is always recommended to take the dose at the same time every day. In case, you have missed it, take it as soon as you remember. Do not double dose or take the missed dose, if you are near the time for your next dose.\nThe dosage of this medication is different for different patients. Follow your doctor's directions before changing the dose and the number of times you take it. The duration of the medication also depends on the medical condition you have.\nThe side-effects of using Androxal are:\nCheck with your doctor if any of these symptoms are bothersome.\nSome of the medicines should not be taken together at all. Therefore, your doctor should always be informed about all the medications you are taking to avoid any drug interaction.\nAlso, the existence of any other medical problem may affect the usage of clomiphene. Make sure you inform your doctor if you are suffering from a cyst on the ovary, fibroid tumor of the uterus, inflamed veins due to blood clots, endometriosis, liver disease, depression, unusual vaginal bleeding, etc.\nWhen this medication is taken, regular visits to the doctor are necessary to check the progress and effectiveness of the medication on you. In case, you think you are pregnant. Don't delay! Taking clomiphene while you are pregnant may cause birth defects.\nResearch Community - Coronavirus (COVID-19)\nHere you will find information and guidelines for Ulster's research community, including PhD researchers.\nUlster University experts are tackling the Covid-19 pandemic from every angle, and leveraging global partnership networks to support the local, national and international response.\nAll Researchers are reminded that there may be a delay in accessing the emergency services in the event of an accident at work. As such, essential research must be of a low risk basis.\nAs it is possible that issues relating to Covid-19 could cause setbacks to research, this section is intended to highlight specific factors that occur more frequently in a research context and to aid planning as an individual researcher or as the leader of a research team.\nSetbacks could range from minor delays through to the irrecoverable loss of significant work.

It is recognised that institutions are needing to divert staff resource to other critical areas, including for those working in clinical and health-related fields.\nSuch activities should be prioritised without concern for the effect on REF preparations. The REF exercise has been put on hold until further notice to enable this, and adapted details of the framework are being developed.\nThe submission deadline on 27 November 2020 will no longer apply, and a new submission deadline will be announced no later than eight months prior to the deadline. Full allowance will be made for the impact of coronavirus across affected areas of submissions.\nThe UK research funding bodies recognise the significant effort that has been invested so far by institutions in preparations for the current REF cycle. In view of this, and following the Minister's advice to universities on supporting their staff, the REF staff census date (31 July 2020) remains unchanged.\nThe full impact on universities as they respond to calls to support the national effort in the face of COVID-19 is yet to be fully understood. As greater clarity about the period of serious disruption to universities emerges, REF will undertake a light touch consultation on the adapted details of the framework, in view of these challenging times.\nThe 3 April deadline for nominations to the expert panels has been lifted and nominations may continue to be made until further notice; an appropriate notice period will be given once a new deadline is in place\nResearch Suspensions\nWhat action do we take in relation to human research studies that involve direct contact?\nAll face-to-face research involving human participants in the community must be conducted in line with current government regulations and guidelines on social interaction/distancing and any travel restrictions in force at the time.

The chemicals, however, still make their way into the environment and many people have been exposed to low levels of the chemicals, according to a press release.\n\"As endocrine-disrupting chemicals, PCBs interfere with the way the thyroid hormone functions, but they don't actually change the amount of the hormone found in the body,\" study researcher R. Thomas Zoeller, PhD, of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, said in the release.\n\"Although these effects are largely invisible in scientific studies that only judge thyroid activity by measuring hormone levels, they may be having a real impact on infants' brain development.\"\nZoeller and colleagues conducted a birth cohort study of 164 pregnant women with low-dose chemical exposure and no thyroid disease from the GESTE study.\nFor the study, the researchers measured maternal and cord blood thyroid hormone levels at birth. They quantified mRNA levels of CYP1A1 — an enzyme that converts endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) into a form that directly interferes with the body's thyroid hormone receptors — and placental thyroid hormone receptor targets (placental lactogen and human growth hormone V [GH-V]).\nResults showed that pregnancies with higher amounts of CYP1A1 in the placenta also appeared to have evidence of thyroid disruption in the tissue. These pregnancies also tended to have higher placental lactogen and GH-V levels, even as the mothers' overall thyroid hormone levels remained the same, according to the release.\n\"Whatever is happening in the placenta likely reflects what is happening in the fetus,\" Dr. Zoeller said. \"To truly understand how endocrine-disrupting chemicals may be affecting pregnancies, the findings show we need to study not only hormone levels, but hormone activity at the cellular level.\"\nZoeller also noted that smoking may exacerbate the effects of EDCs, as exposure to cigarette smoke increases the body's production of CYP1A1. In the study, placental tissue from pregnant women who smoked generally contained higher levels of the enzyme, according to the release.\nChristian Hospital Northeast Emergency Department - Volk Construction\nChristian Hospital Northeast Emergency Department\nVolk Construction / Portfolio / Christian Hospital Northeast Emergency Department\nBJC, Christian Hospital\nPhase 1 of the project was a partial renovation of the radiology department.

Irreversible electroporation is the stage at which the electric field has been applied with sufficient amplitude and duration to cause permanent damage to the cell membrane and thus cell death.\nUnder general anaesthesia and with imaging guidance, needle-electrodes are passed directly through the skin into the target tumour. Up to six single use disposable needles are placed at a fixed distance apart in the target lesion. A series of very short electrical field pulses are delivered over several minutes to ablate the tumour and a small surrounding tissue margin.\nPercutaneous approach with image guidance:\nJ12.8 Other specified other therapeutic percutaneous operations on liver\nY12.3 Electrochemotherapy to lesion of organ NOC\nIn addition ICD-10 code C78.7 Secondary malignant neoplasm of liver and intrahepatic bile duct is assigned.\nHome/Neurological disorders/Parkinson's Disease/The Challenges of Diagnosing PD\nDiagnosing Parkinson's disease can be challenging, especially during the early stages. Nearly 40% of people with the disease may never be diagnosed, and as many as 25% are misdiagnosed. Even during disease progression, symptoms may be difficult to evaluate and may reflect other disorders. A tremor may not be obvious while a person is sitting or posture changes may appear as osteoporosis or merely a sign of aging. Some doctors, who feel that tremor is a requirement for diagnosis, may not know that as many as one third of people with Parkinson's disease may not experience tremor.\nAdditionally, making the diagnosis is even more difficult because currently there are no blood or lab tests available to diagnose the disease. Some tests, such as a CT scan or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), may be utilized to rule out other disorders that cause similar symptoms. Given these conditions, a doctor may need to observe the patient over time to distinguish signs of tremor and rigidity, and combine them with other typical symptoms. The doctor will also accumulate a complete history of the patient's symptoms, activity, medications, other medical problems, and exposures to toxic chemicals. This will typically be followed up with an arduous physical exam with focus on the functions of the brain and nervous system. Tests are performed on the patient's reflexes, coordination, muscle strength, and mental function. Making a clear-cut diagnosis is vital for prescribing the correct treatment procedure. The treatment decisions made early in the illness can have profound repercussions on the long-term success of treatment.\nBecause the diagnosis is based on the doctor's exam of the patient, it is crucial that the doctor be experienced in evaluating and diagnosing patients with PD. If you suspect you have PD, you should see a specialist, if possible a movement disorders trained neurologist.\nWhy Talk Therapy is the Cornerstone of Addiction Treatment\nTalk Therapy for Addiction Treatment\nSouth Florida Drug Rehab » Talk Therapy for Addiction Treatment\nAddiction is a very severe mental illness that hijacks the brain, which makes it difficult to separate truth from fiction. In your active addiction, you may feel like you're all alone in your struggles because people don't understand. On the other hand, you may feel as though you're not someone who deserves to have someone listen. Talk therapy is a crucial part of addiction treatment as a way to help your brain heal and give you clarity.\nThere's No Judgement in Talk Therapy\nPsychotherapy Heals the Brain\nWhat separates people with an addiction from those who don't is a malfunctioning prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex not only helps to regulate the flow of dopamine in the brain, but it has many other responsibilities as well. When the prefrontal cortex isn't functioning properly, it makes it extremely difficult for people with addiction to get sober. The great news is that with treatment, this part of the brain can begin to heal and reboot necessary functions, including:\nEach of these different aspects of the prefrontal cortex begins to heal through the process of addiction therapy. Through the education individuals receive in addiction treatment, they start to understand why they feel so different. The lack of attunement makes it difficult to connect to others, and a lack of self-awareness stops you from seeing the truth. By being able to talk about the realities of different situations, you begin the healing process of recovery.\nThrough this type of therapy, you have the opportunity to work with someone who is coming from a non-biased, non-judgmental place. This is extremely important for anyone who has a hard time opening up. A therapist knows that no matter where you came from, you're not defined by past experiences. Addiction is a legitimate illness, and you'll be treated with kindness, respect, tolerance and compassion.\nScientists spend a lot of time studying the disease of addiction in order to find the best ways to begin healing the brain. Working with trained professionals at an addiction treatment center gives you the chance to make progress. Evidence-based treatment methods and psychotherapy help you begin to recognize reality again. You'll also begin to feel empowered because many of the things that heal you are already within you.\n1st Step Behavioral Health wants to help you see that there's a much better life that awaits you in recovery.

Abnormalities in RAAS system especially stemming from genetic variability in ACE and ACE2 expression (including ACE I/D polymorphism) have been proposed to explain underlying pathogenesis and variability in SARS-CoV-2 infection. In a meta-regression data set of 30 countries, we found significant associations of ACE I/D ratio and COVID-19 prevalence, deaths and recovery rate but not when adjusted for possible confounders. This ecological study suggests potential of ACE I/D data as predictive biomarker COVID-19 risk and severity in a population specific manner, subject to validation in large genetic epidemiological and functional studies.\npopulation specific manner\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global pandemic with concerning figures for total cases (>26.5 millions), deaths (>0.9 million), and serious/critical (>58 thousands) (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ as of September 01, 2020) with serious global effects on healthcare, economy and life style. COVID-19 epidemiological data displays regional tropism where Europe seems to have suffered from a higher incidence and death rates than China and other East Asian countries [1]. In addition, significant heterogeneity in clinical course of COVID-19 disease has also been observed ranging from asymptomatic carriers and mild flu-like symptoms to severe respiratory distress with increased risk of multi-organ failure and subsequent death [2]. This data suggests that viral and host genetic modulators in addition to the classical systemic risk factors and socio-behavioral differences could differentially facilitate COVID-19 infection and outcome. As a result, global efforts such as COVID-19 host genetics initiative (https://www.covid19hg.org/), and vaccine development are in progress with special focus on host genetic determinants to better understand its pathophysiology and ways to combat it.\nThe renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is involved in regulation of blood pressure and extracellular volume and is regulated by reciprocal interaction of two key angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) analogs i.e. ACE1 (converts angiotension I to angiotension II) and ACE2 (metabolizes angiotension II) [3]. COVID-19 represents a condition where the delicate RAAS hemostatic balance is disturbed resulting in vasoconstrictive, pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic and pro-apoptotic effects of unopposed angiotension II which may explain acute lung injury and other pathologies observed as a result of SARS-CoV-2 infection [reviewed in [4]]. Several observations support the evident association between RAAS imbalance and COVID-19 disease including; (1) the ACE2 is the main cellular receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 and this interaction results in exhaustion and reduced expression of ACE2 [5,6], (2) animal models of SARS-CoV and disrupted ACE2 demonstrating ACE2 downregulation mediated severe lung and cardiovascular injuries [7,8], (3) recombinant ACE2 offers protection against lung injury in mice and SARS-CoV-2 infection in human organoids [9], and functional genetic variations in ACE2 and its analog ACE, especially the 287bp insertion/deletion (Ins/Del) polymorphism (rs4646994), may reflect variability in ACE and ACE2 levels in general population (e.g. D allele of ACE I/D polymorphism mediates higher ACE expression) [10] and have been associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypertension, obesity/metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular risk, and abnormal blood clotting tendency; all of which represent clinical hallmarks of severe COVID-19 disease [reviewed in [4,11]]. In contrast, no clinical advantage was observed in COVID-19 patients treated with ACE inhibitors or angiotension receptor blockers (mediating high ACE2 and low angiotension II) [12], suggesting that further efforts are needed to fully comprehend the role of RAAS in COVID-19. Therefore, the present study employed an ecological meta-regression design to evaluate the ACE1 I/D genotypic data in relation to the observed differences in COVID-19 epidemiological parameters in different ethnicities especially in European and Asian countries.\nThe ACE I/D polymorphism frequency data for each country was retrieved from previously published studies following the Systematic Studies and Meta-Analysis Reporting System (PRISMA) guidelines. The main inclusion criteria for studies was reporting of ACE I/D variant genotypic data in healthy population. I and D allele frequencies for ACE polymorphism in healthy controls of each study were retrieved and used for estimations of cumulative I/D ratio for each country.\nCOVID-19 data pertaining to prevalence, serious or critical patients, deaths and recovery rate for each country (per 106 population for all variables) were extracted as available from www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/countries website. Since different indicators of economy, health services and prevalence of relevant chronic health conditions may modulate country specific COVID-19 data, different confounding variables including COVID-19 diagnostic tests performed (number per 106 inhabitants), GDP/capita (PPP), current health expenditure/capita (PPP), healthy life expectancy at birth, DALY diabetes mellitus, DALY hypertensive heart disease and DALY respiratory infections as retrieved from the World Health Organization website www.who.int/countries/en/.\nComprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 was used to generate the forest plot where points of estimation (I/D ratios) were calculated by dividing frequency of I-allele with that of D-allele among all the studies of each country along with standard error of each ratio (for countries having more than one study). Normal distribution of variables was checked using Shapiro-Wilk test and non-normally distributed variables were log-transformed using log1p function. The estimated value of association, p-value and meta-analytic scatterplots were generated using Metafor R package. Multivariable linear regression models were constructed where COVID-19 epidemiological measures (prevalence, serious or critical patients, deaths and recovery rate) were taken as outcome variables while considering ACE I/D ratio and above mentioned confounding variables as explanatory factors. All the statistics were performed on R version 4.0.2. A two tailed p-value less than 0.05 was considered as significant.\nWe first performed a crude overall analysis including all countries (n=47), where the univariate regression analysis suggested no significant associations between ACE I/D ratio and COVID-19 epidemiological parameters (Online ResourceSupplementary Table S1). Similar trends with no significant associations were observed in multivariate regression analysis after adjusting the data for possible confounders (Online Resource Supplementary Table S2). However, when data was subdivided into two major groups (Asian and European countries), it was observed that a decrease in ACE I/D ratio was significantly associated with an increase in COVID-19 mediated deaths/million only in Asians (point estimate = -3.21, p = 0.01). However, univariate and multivariate regression results showed non-significant associations of the COVID-19 log-transformed prevalence, deaths, serious or critical and recovery rate with ACE I/D polymorphism in the Europeans (Online Resource Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).\nWe further performed quality control of our cumulative dataset by including only countries (a) with more than one studies for ACE I/D ratio, and (b) with ACE I/D polymorphism frequencies conforming to HWE, thus, resulting in a total of 30 countries in this refined dataset. The meta-analysis results for cumulative ACE I/D ratio of included studies are presented in Figure 1. The overall point estimate was 0.625 (95% CI 0.60-0.65) with no apparent publication bias as shown in Online Resource Supplementary Figure S1. Asian countries displayed relatively higher ACE I/D allele frequency ratios (all ≥0.85 with an average of 1.01) compared to European countries (average ACE I/D ratio of 0.60).\nMeta-regression results for this refined dataset indicated a significant association of ACE I/D ratio with the COVID-19 prevalence (point estimate = -0.059, p = 0.001), deaths/million (point estimate = -0.039, p = 0.01), and recovery rate (point estimate = -0.037, p = 0.02) (Figure 2) but not with severity of the disease (point estimate = -0.030, p = 0.18). However, none of these associations persisted when data was adjusted for possible confounding variables in multivariate regression analyses (Table 1).\nThe COVID-19 related data and knowledge is rapidly evolving. Our meta-regression results indicate a possible correlation of ACE I/D polymorphism with COVID-19 prevalence, deaths and recovery rate. It means that the countries with lower ACE I/D ratios (i.e. high frequency of D allele) showed higher prevalence and deaths due to COVID-19 infection especially in the context of European versus Asian countries. However, this correlation could not be established when adjusted for possible confounders, although multivariate regression analysis was not performed in Asian sub-group due to low sample size. Overall, the ACE I/D variant presents specific genotypic frequency in Caucasian and Asian populations. Most European (especially North European) and East Asian (as some South European) countries demonstration high and low distribution of the D/D genotype, respectively. These population specific genotypic distributions may have resulted from the long-term human migration patterns eastward and westward across the vast Eurasian continent. The present findings based on ACE I/D data offer explanation, at least partially, for the observed differences in COVID-19 prevalence and mortality between the East Asian and European countries. However, it is noteworthy that differential socio-economical, healthcare and societal/behavioral factors among different ethnicities may significantly modulate these apparent associations between ACE I/D polymorphism and COVID-19 epidemiological measures.\nPreviously various studies reported association of ACE I/D polymorphism either with COVID-19 prevalence [13-16], or mortality (affected by COVID-19 testing intensity) or deaths/million (independent of COVID-19 testing intensity) [15,16,11,17] or with recovery rate [18]. The variability in the results of the previous meta-regression reports may have originated from differences in; (1) measure of ACE I/D polymorphism and COVID-19 parameters used and source/method of data retrieval, (2) relative distribution of ethnicities/countries included, and (3) the data analysis approaches (e.g. adjustment for possible confounders and sensitivity analyses).\nFunctionally, COVID-19 patients with low I/D ratios may have an unopposed abundance of angiotension II protein in their blood resulting from more D-allele mediated excessive ACE expression on one hand and downregulation of ACE2 receptor because of SARS-Cov-2 engagement on the other, thus triggering downstream deleterious effects most notably of which is acute lung injury [4]. This RAAS imbalance due to ACE abundance may also explain why elders are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection [19]. In addition, preliminary evidence was also provided by a recent study reporting hypertension dependent association of ACE DD genotype and severe COVID-19 using a sample set of 204 Spanish SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [20]. Thus, excessive serum ACE levels and/or presence of ACE Del/Del genotype may still predict a more severe clinical course in SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nNevertheless, the present study has some limitations. Due to the ecologic study design, the results of the present study should be considered as a mean to develop hypothesis rather than definitive casual associations and should not be subjected to individual level interpretations. In addition, several additional confounders of genetic, epigenetic, social/behavioral and environmental in origin may contribute towards observed COVID-19 epidemiology data and thus should be accounted for in the future studies.\nIn conclusion, the results of present study should be interpreted with caution and further studies following genetic epidemiological, cohort and experimental study designs with functional validations and based on samples from COVID-19 patients should be conducted to delineate definitive causal relationship between the genetic variants in RAAS, especially ACE I/D polymorphism, and outcome of the COVID-19.\nAll authors contributed to the study conception and design.

But when the flow of breath taken by these respiratory tubes starts to get blocked, there is trouble in breathing. The air that is inhaled does not reach the lungs completely, due to which the person starts breathing stridently while trying to breathe. This condition is called asthma.\nTreatment and Care\nResearch\nJain’s cow urine therapy clinic aims for a happy and healthy life by integrating ancient Ayurvedic knowledge with modern technology. Our therapy means cow urine including Ayurveda works on a person’s three doshas that are- The Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These tri-energies maintain our health, any imbalance in these doshas, is responsible for human’s health and disease. We are glad to say that we have seen so many positive results through our treatment. Thousands of people got rid of many diseases after taking our treatment.\nOur patients not only put an end to their disease but also live a disease-free healthy life forever. This is the reason why people are getting attention towards our therapy. Our years of research in Ayurvedic treatments have helped us advance our methodology. We aim to reach as many people as we can to build a healthy and happy society all over the world.\nEffective Treatment By Cow Urine Therapy\nConsistent with the cow urine healing approach a few herbs work to rejuvenate physique defects (Vata, bile and phlegm) which cause asthma if they may be disproportionated. A few Ayurvedic medicines comprise many beneficial elements to deal with them. It improves the metabolism of the body.\nBRONKOL+ LIQUID ORAL\nKOFNOL+ CAPSULE\nTONER (NASAL DROPS)\nFORTEX Pak\nKey herbs which makes the treatement more effective\nMulethi\nDue to its expectorant and bronchodilator properties, it can treat cough, bronchitis and also reduce the effects of chronic asthma. It even loosens and thins the mucus that clogs the airways and helps facilitate its expulsion through coughing to relieve congestion.\nHaldi\nHaldi has an effective property named curcumin. This agent can also reduce respiratory inflammation. Curcumin can aid in reducing inflammation and reducing airway obstruction. As an add-on drug for the treatment of asthma, it is effective and healthy.\nTulsi\nIt is an excellent aid against the symptoms of asthma. Camphene, cineole, and eugenol present in tulsi help to reduce cold and congestion in the chest. It is effective in asthma, influenza, cough, and cold. These tulsi extracts help to keep open the passages of the bronchial airway. This allows patients with asthma to have improved lung processes and fewer attacks.\nKantakari\nKantkari is very effective in drawing out the scum of Kapha from the bronchial tubes resulting in the oxygenation of the blood and relieving symptoms of asthma and providing solace to a person.\nBilva Patra\nIt contains chemicals called tannins, flavonoids and coumarins. These chemicals help to reduce swelling (inflammation). This might help treat asthma and other respiratory conditions.\nPippli\nIt has decongestant, bronchodilator and expectorant activities. Pippli is very useful for asthma due to its Kapha balancing property. It helps release mucus from the air passages due to its expectorant property thus allowing the person to breathe easily.\nKutki\nIt is also a strong antibacterial herb. In the respiratory system, Kutki has demonstrated the ability to reduce the severity and longevity of asthmatic attacks and has been attributed to compounds such as androsin and apocynin.\nSonth\nIt is a well-known natural treatment for various conditions including asthma. It can help reduce airway inflammation and inhibit airway contraction.\nTriphala\nTriphala has been shown to alleviate bronchial hyperreactivity in asthma. It is very effective to strengthen the respiratory and immune systems.\nKali Mirch\nKali Mirch is beneficial for cough and respiratory problems due to its antitussive (relieving cough) and anti-asthmatic properties. By using Kali Mirch one gets relief from throat problems and cough.\nCow Milk\nCow milk contains nutrients like probiotics, vitamin D, and immunoglobulins that boost the immune system and in turn reduce the risk of asthmatic allergies. It can help reduce respiratory infection and the chances of one getting an asthmatic attack.\nCow Milk curd\nThe healthy bacteria found in cow milk curd helps lung tissues to stay healthier. Specifically, it can stimulate the production of interleukin cells which decreases the risk of asthma inflammation.\nGomay Ras\nGomay Ras causes a temporary low state of inflammation in the lungs that somehow dampen the immune system's response to allergens.\nCow Ghee\nCow ghee not only keeps the body warm but also treats common cold, cough and breathing problems. Ghee is rich in antioxidants and acts as an aid in the absorption of vitamins and minerals from other foods.\nAmla Green\nAmla green is very high in vitamin C which helps in improving immunity and tolerance to asthma. Its anti-inflammatory properties play a vital role in the reduction of the severity of asthma attacks.\nAshwagandha\nAshwagandha provides a range of health benefits in reducing inflammation and anxiety. These benefits help fight diseases including asthma. Ashwagandha root extract could enhance a person's cardiorespiratory endurance.\nDalchini Powder\nCinnamaldehyde, one of the main active components of this herb may help fight various kinds of lung infection. It has been shown to effectively treat respiratory tract infections caused by fungi. It helps to remove phlegm from the throat and gives the immune system a boost.\nElaichi Powder\nElaichi Powder has an antimicrobial and antiseptic active ingredient called cineole which helps prevent any bacterial infection that could directly or indirectly damage the lungs. This is especially helpful for people who are asthmatic. It makes breathing easier by enhancing blood circulation within the lungs. It also fights related inflammation by soothing the mucus membranes.\nShatavari\nShatavari helps in the treatment of respiratory disorders which can help asthma patients. The Shatavari root effectively treats a cough and cold. It may help strengthen a person’s immune system.\nGojala\nWe use gojala in our cow-urine therapy, basically it means cow-urine extract, the main component in our medicine. This extract is made of the urine of the indigenous breeds of cow. Gojala has its own benefits because it’s beyond the possibility of any kind of contamination. It has high quality and is abundant. When gojala mixed with ayurvedic herbs it becomes more effective to treat any disease and favourable to the consequence of the particular disease. This extract is superimly tested and that’s why it’s more trustable and beneficial as well.\nQuality of Life\nRemedy with cow urine brings accurate fitness and maintains the doshas in order. Today as an end result of our medication human beings are continuously enhancing their health. It improves the condition of their day-to-day life. Ayurvedic drugs alongside cow urine can serve as a complementary remedy to limit a range of reactions that come from the usage of heavy doses, mental pressure, radiations and chemotherapies. We inform humans how to live a joyful and anxiety-free life with an untreatable disorder if any. Thousands of human beings live a balanced lifestyle after taking our remedy and it’s a big achievement for us to provide them a life they dream of.\nComplication Prevention\nIn Ayurveda, cow urine has a special position that is often said to be helpful for illnesses like asthma. Our years of painstaking work prove that by using our herbs, almost all complications of asthma vanish. Sufferers tell us that they notice a big relief in chest pain, difficulty in breathing and asphyxia, tiredness, control and balance hormonal and chemical changes in the body, and improve the patient’s immune system that works favorably for other asthma complications.\nLife Expectancy\nIf we are concerned about life expectancy, cow urine treatment itself is a lot of promise. Any disorder, whether minor or critical, has a negative effect on the health of a person and lasts for a period of years, often for life. Life expectancy is brief until the condition is identified, but not with cow-urine treatment. Not only does our ancient therapy comfort the illness, but it also enhances the longevity of the person without leaving any contaminants in his body and this is our ultimate objective.\nReducing Drug Dependency\n“Sarve bhavantu sukhinah, Sarve santu niramayah, Sarve bhadrani pashyantu, Maa kaschit dukha bhag-bhavet”, its capacity let all be happy, let all be free from disease, let all see the truth, may no-one experience suffering. By following this proverb, we prefer our society to be like this. Our remedy accomplishes this by way of giving reliable treatment, enhancing life expectancy and decreasing the drug dependency of affected people. Our remedy has greater benefits and nil risks than any psychological therapies available in this current world.\nReducing Recurrence Chances\nIn comparison to wide-ranging general practice, we concentrate on the underlying cause of the disease and causes that may increase the chances of recurrence of the disease rather than relying exclusively on disease control. We are effectively decreasing recurrence rates by implementing this approach and providing a different path to the lives of people so that they can live their lives mentally and physically in a healthier way.\nCauses and Prevention\nCauses of Asthma\nNormally, due to swelling and shrinkage in the respiratory tubes, a serious disease like asthma arises in which many reasons for this condition may be responsible for daily routine which gradually play its important role in giving rise. Asthma disease can be caused due to many reasons, but it is necessary to find those reasons because without knowing the cause we will not know whether this disease is actually asthma or something else. Factors responsible for asthma disease are:\nGenetically transmitted disease\nOne major reason for having asthma disease is to reach other family members from one generation to another by the person suffering from asthma. Due to some problems or changes in DNA, the risk of getting such disease is often increased. However, in such circumstances, the disease usually occurs in the same way but the level, symptoms, causes and consequences of this disease also changes due to the changing phase of the age and the ability of the body to change itself.\nAllergic Reactions\nInfluence of airways by dust particles present in the air\nAsthma disease is the result of reaction in the body due to dust particles present in the air. These dust particles block the passage of air coming out of the airways after entering through the mouth and nose and the person suffocates and it’s hard for him to breathe properly.\nHighest level of allergy\nDue to the presence of anything in the air, when our body’s immune system reacts exceptionally to any external substances it is a kind of allergy. When the fine particles in the air enter in our body, it affects the lungs and respiratory tubes and causes asthma disease. These particles can be in any form such as finely dusted clay particles, wheat grains of paddy, fine hairs of a pet or existing particles of some kind of chemicals.\nDamage to respiratory tract due to strong smell\nExtremely strong odour causes weak lungs and trachea to become infected and the person does not breathe properly. The smell of perfumes, incense sticks, strong chilli, harmful chemicals, acids etc., when a person with a weak lung inhales these strong odours, he constantly sneezes and coughs and it causes the risk of their lungs becoming infected.\n3. Excessive use of heavy medicines\nSometimes if the right disease is not caught or due to small infection and disease, it is treated with heavy medicines which causes the disease to be cured, but due to the side effects of the reaction of those heavy medicines, it directly affects our body. Any of these medicines taken in the treatment for any pain or cure cough, fever and colds become fatal to the body and cause asthma.\n4. Food Supplement\nIf a person has food allergy, he may have asthma. Some foods in the food supplement that react in the body, produce symptoms that are capable of causing asthma. This allergy can be very serious and sometimes it can even kill a person. If a person is allergic to food, it is possible that asthma can become an important part of their life that he needs to find out. There are many foods that can cause allergy. They are:\nWheat\nPeanut\nCoconut\nMustard\nSpleen\nEggs\nMillet\nSoyabean\nMilk & milk products\nDry fruits\nFish\nIf a person is allergic to any of the food items, he should avoid eating all these foods and should know that these things will also increase his chances of having asthma.\n5. Smoke & Smog\nPeople who are addicted to cigarette smoking continuously for many years, such people have more chances of having asthma. Slowly, their lungs start to weaken and the mucus cough starts continuously. If a woman is about to become a mother and is smoking cigarettes, in such a time it will have a detrimental effect on her child as well as that child may also be born with weak lungs and also have to suffer from asthma in his life.\nAny type of smog that comes out of cigarettes, vehicles, chemical factories, incense sticks or burning waste material reaches our lungs and blocks our breathing process and the problem of stretching in breathing tubes arises.\n6 Inflammation & Infection\nOur lungs start swelling, blocking the passage of respiratory tracts and attacks of asthma if we inhale strong odor, smoke or smog. This problem of sinusitis can also cause a person to have an asthma attack. This is a type of nasal problem in which the passage of the pores in the nose which helps in breathing becomes blocked due to some reason.\n7. Physical Activity & Mental Stress\nIf a person suffers from asthma and starts exercising continuously, it causes a deep shock to their body and there is a gradual contraction in the lungs and respiratory tubes and that person gets an attack of asthma. To keep the body strong, heavy exercise is done for hours, it causes them to feel stretch and pain in the lungs and they have trouble breathing.\nStress is a common thing in the kind of person living today but when this stress becomes so much then a person loses control of his physical and mental condition. In such a situation this mental stress remains for a long time that puts a bad effect on their body. In such a situation, the person laughing, crying, being happy or sad and thinking more, every situation has its side effects on their brain and body which directly hits their asthma.\nPrevention from Asthma\nPrevention of asthma is often considered to be very important as it rises to a small level and takes a serious form if ignored. To prevent asthma, the sufferer has to adopt various measures such as:\nProtecting from dusty soil allergies as much as possible\nTry to avoid taking so much stress\nTaking appropriate medicines for any other disease to avoid side effects\nThe practice of yoga and exercise has to be done on a daily basis\nTaking steps to ensure that the level of asthma is properly checked and treated accordingly\nMaking a habit of living in pure air and away from chemicals and polluted areas\nUnderstanding and keeping correct information about your allergy, keeping symptoms in mind and avoiding getting affected\nGet vaccinated periodically\nSymptoms and Types\nSymptoms of Asthma\nIf someone is suffering from asthma his symptoms are revealed only by his breathing process due to contraction and swelling in his respiratory tubes. Many symptoms of asthma can be revealed in a person like:\nDifficulty in breathing and asphyxia\nThe first and foremost symptom of asthma is sensed in the event of shortness of breath. If a person suspects of having an asthma disease or if he has an asthma attack, he has to breathe hard to check his breathing.\nSweating and shivering\nDue to suffocation sufferers suffering from asthma, a person starts feeling restless and nervous, he starts sweating and trembling hands and body. A person starts to lose control of himself and he constantly tries to breathe. Such conditions are sufficient to detect the symptoms of asthma.\nBody fatigue\nEarly tiredness of the body can also be a symptom of asthma. In such a situation, the person gets tired of doing any small work and tiredness persists throughout the day and heaviness occurs in the body. In such a situation, the person starts breathing fast. In these circumstances, he can’t walk fast, run or climb up the stairs.\nFeeling of heaviness in the head\nDue to the narrowing of the lungs and blocking the passage of the airways, a person is not able to breathe properly which has a direct effect on his brain and he feels heaviness in the head. There is a kind of pressure in the head, the nerves start to stretch and the veins start to swell if a person is asthmatic.\nSevere chest pain and rapid heartbeat\nSevere pain starts in a person’s chest when he gets an asthma attack. This pain remains constant for the whole day or a few days. Due to the inhalation of the person, the extent of panic increases so much that his heartbeat also becomes faster than normal and sometimes this condition becomes more serious.\nTypes of Asthma.\nAsthma disease is neither the same in every asthmatic nor the symptoms. Asthma can happen to anyone at any point of age whether it is children, older, female or male. There are also different types of asthma that can be treated properly according to their symptoms. These types are:\nGenetic Asthma\nFamily history becomes a risk factor for asthma involving different genes. Genetic asthma is a type of genetically progressive asthma in which genes are transferred from one generation to another and then to the third generation and then react accordingly. These reactions of asthma can be due to any allergies, habits and physical deficiencies. If the father has asthma, it is not necessary that his son or daughter also has asthma, but his grandchildren have asthma.\nAllergic Asthma\nIf a person is allergic to something like dust, dirt, smell, smoke, fine particles or any food item, there are breathing problems such as persistent cough, cold, nasal congestion or sneezing. It is known as allergic asthma. It is the most common type of asthma. Most children have this type of allergy.\nChronic cough and cold Asthma\nIt is common for any person to have a cough or cold. But when these coughs and colds become chronic or have been going on for a long time, it increases the swelling in the lungs and infects the lungs which cause trouble in breathing. Lungs become weak and constant dry and mucus cough and constant watery discharge come from the nose. Their bacteria reach inside the body to damage the lungs.\nVocational Asthma\nIt is known as occupational asthma when a person starts having asthma attacks due to his working space. If a person has any type of allergy due to the environment of his place of work, his asthma can emerge. The polluted air of the environment, dusty soil, factory smoke, poisonous gases etc. cause human beings to damage their lungs and respiratory tract. Apart from this, due to excessive work stress, one also gets asthma attacks.\nPhysical Exertion Asthma\nAsthma due to physical exhaustion is that type of asthma in which human’s physical work is more. Normally, exercising causes more tiredness in the human body and at that time they come to know the symptoms of asthma. At the time of exercise or after hours, a person starts feeling constricted in the respiratory tract. During that time the person starts coughing continuously and the chest starts to get heavy and the breath starts blooming.\nComplications\nComplications of Asthma\nThe contraction and swelling in the airways causes trouble in breathing\nInability to detect asthma levels, side effects of medicines worsen the condition\nLack of energy\nTightness and mucus in the chest due to persistent cough\nStress and anxiety\nLack of sleep and restlessness throughout the day\nHeaviness of the chest increases gradually.\nUS Patents\n#6410059\n#6896707\n#7235262\nRecognitions\nGMP Registration\nCLOSE\nIP Rights Registration\nCLOSE\nWorld Book of Records\nCLOSE\nWhat Patients Are Saying\n\"Various studies have been conducted where Jain's Cow Urine Therapy has shown significant improvement in patients.\"\nElectroencephalographic evidence for improved visual working memory performance during standing and exercise. | Semantic Scholar\nSearch 205,658,147 papers from all fields of science\nCorpus ID: 52960179\n@article{Dodwell2019ElectroencephalographicEF,\ntitle={Electroencephalographic evidence for improved visual working memory performance during standing and exercise.},\nauthor={Gordon Dodwell and Hermann J.

(Photo: Pexels)\nWashington: A new study revealed how obesity can contribute to promote breast cancer in women. Obesity leads to the release of cytokines into the bloodstream, which impacts the metabolism of breast cancer cells, making them more aggressive as a result.\nThe study stated an as yet unknown mechanism making breast cancer more aggressive. The enzyme ACC1* plays a central role in this process,\" said Dr. Mauricio Berriel Diaz, deputy director of the Institute for Diabetes and Cancer (IDC) at Helmholtz Zentrum München.\n\"ACC1 is a key component of fatty acid synthesis,\" Diaz added. \"However, its function is impaired by the cytokines leptin and TGF-ß.\" The levels of these cytokines are increased particularly in the blood of severely overweight subjects.\n\"Blocking the signalling pathways and switching off the metastasis-related genes could be a therapeutic target,\" Herzig said. \"As part of the so-called neoadjuvant therapy, the risk of metastases or the recurrence of tumours could be reduced prior to the surgical removal of the tumour.\"\nhttp://www.hpolyeedy.cf\nCommon Health Benefits of Clapping That Can Change Your Life Leading to a Healthy Future\nMost people today would be surprised to realize that clapping or applauding with hands is a good exercise for the body that helps to stimulate the organs resulting in its smooth functioning hence scientific research have proved the fact that little babies who have the habit of clapping grow up with smart brains. This physical movement is the direct key to living a cheerful and stress-free life as striking with the palms is a therapy, related to celebrations as well as achievements thus play a major role in healing depression, hypertension, occasional headaches and problems such as hair fall. Clapping during the morning hours of the day such as while praying at the holy places or singing songs helps to activate a large section of the brain gradually improving the health. It is also a useful medicine for curing pains such as arthritis or any other form of ailment in the different parts of the body.\nDoctors have suggested for applying to both the hands some coconut or palm oil so as to stimulate the pressure points in the fingers and make them active in order to create energy waves in the body. By striking both the hands helps in better blood circulation in the veins and arteries and is extremely beneficial for those with cholesterol problems. Also, children who are prone to clapping on a daily basis in the schools are likely to have bright academic prospects as they make less spelling mistakes than others as well as increase the levels of concentration. This exercise also helps to improve digestion and make the body more immune to diseases thus allowing to one to remain fit and healthy all life.\nIn present times the residential areas have established amusement parks for the people to gather for exercises and morning walks. Some of them go there for clapping as a routine affair to have positive effects both on the body and mind. A few minutes of claps can help in better secretion of hormones as well as keep the heart healthy by removing all the obstructions from the blood vessels and other channels. Patients suffering from low pressure can also raise their hands and clap for a faster recovery. It is also extremely effective for enhancing the nervous system hence those spend some time from their hectic schedules for clapping daily feel fresh and active throughout the day. It also acts as a medicine in reducing the blood sugar levels as well as help in curing certain mental diseases such as insomnia, protects the body from infections such as common cold and lungs related problems such as asthma and eye defects. Biologically the hands and palms are the settlements for reflex points that ensure the healing response to the entire body system thereby the health benefits of clapping as a yoga exercise is innumerably resulting in the healthy development of the body for the people of all ages.\nMilnacipran was recently approved by FDA for the management of fibromyalgia syndrome. Clinical trials have demonstrated that this agent may be a reasonable alternative or adjunct therapy for patients with fibromyalgia syndrome who are unable to tolerate first-line tricyclic antidepressant therapy.\nFibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a condition classified by widespread chronic pain and is associated with fatigue, morning stiffness, and disordered sleep. Milnacipran is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) that was recently approved by FDA for the management of FMS. In clinical trials, milnacipran has demonstrated efficacy in reducing FMS symptoms, with patients exhibiting response rates of 25% to 33%. Milnacipran is generally well tolerated and has minimal interactions with concomitant drug therapies. Nausea was the adverse event most frequently reported in clinical trials. In patients with FMS who are unable to tolerate first-line tricyclic antidepressant therapy, milnacipran may be a reasonable alternative or adjunct therapy. (Formulary. 2009;44:197–202.)\nFibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a rheumatologic disorder characterized by chronic nonlocalized pain and tenderness. The chronic pain condition is classified by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) as ≥3 months of widespread pain in combination with tenderness at ≥11 of 18 defined tender point sites.1 In addition to chronic pain, 73% to 85% of patients with FMS also report experiencing fatigue, morning stiffness, and sleep disorders.1 Patients may also experience myriad auxiliary symptoms, such as irritable bowel or bladder, depression, anxiety, paresthesias, headaches, and cognitive disturbances.2\nAntidepressant agents offer unique mechanisms within the neurohormonal system that may alleviate symptoms that commonly affect quality of life in patients with FMS. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been associated with reductions in pain, fatigue, and disordered sleep independent of reduction in depression in patients with FMS.4,5 TCAs have been considered first-line therapy in treating FMS, but their use is limited by their anticholinergic side-effect profile.\nMilnacipran (Savella, Forest/Cypress) is an orally administered SNRI that was recently approved for the management of FMS.5,6\nMilnacipran ([±]-[1R(S),2S(R)]-2-[aminomethyl]-N, N-diethyl-1-phenyl-cyclopropanecarboxamide hydrochloride) is an SNRI that has demonstrated greater inhibition of norepinephrine than of serotonin in rat hypothalamus.6 This agent also has some affinity for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor but does not bind to dopamine, histamine, or muscarinic receptors and thus lacks many of the side effects of TCAs.6,7 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans performed after administration of milnacipran have demonstrated increased brain activity in specific areas of the brain (caudatus nucleus, anterior insula, anterior cingulum, and amygdala) that are involved in the pain response in FMS.8\nClauw et al10 conducted a study of 1,196 patients with FMS across 86 US centers. This was a registration trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of milnacipran in a larger patient population. Eligible patients were required to have a score ≥4 on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and a VAS pain score of ≥40 (scale, 0–100). All patients had an FMS diagnosis based on ACR criteria and had to discontinue all CNS-active therapy, as well as medications that would interfere with the evaluation of FMS symptoms; however, patients were allowed to use hydrocodone as rescue therapy (maximum dose, 60 mg/d). Patients entered a 1- to 4-week washout period, followed by a 2-week baseline assessment period. Eligible patients were then randomized to treatment with milnacipran 100 mg/d, milnacipran 200 mg/d, or placebo. Milnacipran-treated patients received 12.5 mg on Day 1, 12.5 mg twice/d for 2 days, 25 mg twice/d for 4 days, and 50 mg twice/d for 7 days. Patients who were randomized to the 200-mg/d group received 100 mg twice/d for 7 days. All other randomized patients underwent placebo dose-escalation to maintain blinding. All patients remained on a stable dose from Weeks 3 to 15, and any patient who was intolerant of the assigned dose was dropped from the trial.\nAt study end, significantly more patients treated with milnacipran than those treated with placebo met the 3 criteria for improvement (changes in morning-recall VAS pain scores, global status on PGIC, and SF-36 PCS score) in FMS symptom response (observed cases [OC] analysis: milnacipran 100 mg/d, 25%; P≤.01 vs placebo; milnacipran 200 mg/d, 26%; P≤.001 vs placebo; placebo, 13%).10 Both doses of milnacipran significantly decreased the composite pain response versus placebo (OC analysis: milnacipran 100 mg/d, 39%; milnacipran 200 mg/d, 46%; placebo, 25%; P≤.001 for both vs placebo). There were also significant differences with both doses of milnacipran in secondary outcomes, including time-weighted averages of weekly mean PED morning-recall pain scores (last observation carried forward [LOCF] analysis, mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM]: milnacipran 100 mg/d, 44.3±0.9; milnacipran 200 mg/d, 43.3±1.0; placebo, 48.9±0.9; P≤.001 for both vs placebo) and PGIC scores (LOCF analysis, mean ± SEM: milnacipran 100 mg/d, 3.1±0.1; milnacipran 200 mg/d, 3.0±0.1; placebo, 3.5±0.1; P≤.001 for both vs placebo). Time-weighted averages of SF-36 PCS reached statistical significance only in the milnacipran 100-mg/d group (LOCF analysis, mean ± SEM: milnacipran 100 mg/d, 35.3±0.4; P≤.001 vs placebo).\nThe most common adverse effect was nausea, which occurred in 34.3%, 37.6%, and 19.2% of patients treated with milnacipran 100 mg/d, milnacipran 200 mg/d, and placebo, respectively.10 Other adverse effects that occurred more frequently with milnacipran than with placebo were constipation, hot flushing, dizziness, palpitations, hyperhidrosis, hypertension, vomiting, tachycardia, and migraine. More patients treated with milnacipran 100 or 200 mg/d discontinued therapy because of adverse effects than those treated with placebo (19.5%, 23.7%, and 9.5%, respectively). The 2 milnacipran doses demonstrated similar efficacy; however, more adverse events were reported in patients receiving milnacipran 200 mg/d. This study demonstrated that milnacipran not only had an effect on pain but also improved fatigue and patient-reported cognitive complaints.\nMease et al11 randomized 888 patients from 59 centers in the United States to treatment with milnacipran 100 mg/d, milnacipran 200 mg/d, or placebo for 6 months. Patients had to discontinue all CNS active therapies but could continue taking acetaminophen, aspirin, and stable doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Patients could use hydrocodone ≤60 mg/d as rescue therapy; however, they could not use this therapy for 48 hours before study visits or during each 2-week period preceding the primary end point (Weeks 14–15 and 26–27). Patients were excluded from the study if they had a severe psychiatric illness. Eligible patients entered a 1- to 4-week washout period and then entered a 2-week baseline period. A greater proportion of patients was randomized to milnacipran 200 mg/d than to milnacipran 100 mg/d or placebo for the collection of long-term safety data. All patients underwent a dose-escalation period of 3 weeks, including those treated with placebo to ensure blinding. Milnacipran-treated patients were scheduled to receive 24 weeks of a stable dose of milnacipran (27-week exposure in total).\nAt 15 weeks, a greater proportion of patients treated with milnacipran 100 and 200 mg/d had met the criteria for a composite responder than those treated with placebo (OC analysis: milnacipran 100 mg/d, 32.8%; P≤.003 vs placebo; milnacipran 200 mg/d, 32.8%; P≤.001 vs placebo; placebo, 17.3%). At 6 months, 31.9% (P≤.017 vs placebo) of patients treated with milnacipran 200 mg/d and 33.3% (P≤.056) of those treated with milnacipran 100 mg/d were composite FMS responders compared with 19% of placebo-treated patients (OC analysis). A statistically significant reduction in pain was observed within 1 week of initiation of milnacipran therapy in both treatment groups and continued throughout the duration of the study, with maximal pain relief observed at 9 weeks. In the OC analysis, 45.2% (P=.003 vs placebo) of patients treated with milnacipran 100 mg/d and 45.4% (P<.001 vs placebo) of patients treated with milnacipran 200 mg/d were FMS pain composite responders versus 27.2% of patients treated with placebo. Milnacipran-treated patients also experienced improvements in physical functioning, fatigue, and cognition as measured by the SF-36 domains of physical functioning, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) total score, and Multiple Ability Self-report Questionnaire (MASQ) score. There were statistically significant improvements in physical functioning (mean change from baseline, 3.55; P<.05 vs placebo), bodily pain (mean change from baseline, 6.05; P<.01 vs placebo), and mental health (mean change from baseline, 3.70; P<.01 vs placebo) as measured by the SF-36 in the milnacipran 200-mg/d group versus placebo. Milnacipran 200 mg/d was also associated with a statistically significant mean change from baseline in fatigue versus placebo at 15 and 27 weeks (MFI score: milnacipran 200 mg/d, –5.62 at Week 15 and –5.80 at Week 27; placebo, –3.04 at Week 15 and –3.35 at Week 27; P<.05). Mean changes in patients' baseline perception of cognitive function were greater in the milnacipran 200-mg/d group versus the placebo group (milnacipran 200 mg/d, –2.28 at Week 15 and –2.68 at Week 27; placebo, 0.10 at Week 15 and 0.16 at Week 27; P<.05). There was no difference among groups with respect to sleep quality or quantity as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS)-Sleep Problems Indices.\nAt 6 months, 43%, 46%, and 35% of patients in the milnacipran 100-mg/d, milnacipran 200-mg/d, and placebo groups, respectively, had discontinued therapy. Most patients discontinued therapy because of adverse events (milnacipran 100 mg/d, 19.6%; milnacipran 200 mg/d, 27%; placebo, 10.3%).11 The overall incidence of side effects was 90.7%, 83.9%, and 85.2% in patients treated with milnacipran 200 mg/d, milnacipran 100 mg/d, and placebo, respectively. The most commonly reported adverse event was nausea, consistent with other clinical trials. This trial and the trial by Clauw et al10 may have limited applicability to patients with FMS who have psychiatric disorders, as these patients were excluded from these studies. It is not known how many patients were excluded because of psychiatric illness in each study; however, in the study by Clauw et al,10 53% of screened patients were excluded, and in the study by Mease et al,11 46% of screened patients were excluded.\nBranco et al12 conducted a phase 3 European trial involving 678 patients at 83 centers. Eligible patients were required to have a mean daily VAS pain score of 20 to 90, FIQ-Physical Function (PF) subscore ≥3, and a Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score ≤25 at baseline. Patients were randomized to milnacipran 100 mg twice/d or placebo for 12 weeks after a 4-week dose escalation. Patients underwent a 9-day down-titration after 12 weeks of therapy and were assessed at 2 weeks after treatment. The primary end point was pain composite responder rate and the PGIC at 16 weeks. The primary end point was measured in the same way as in Clauw et al10 and Mease et al.11 Patients were excluded if they had a severe psychiatric illness; eligible patients had to discontinue all CNS active therapies, as in previous trials.10,11 A major secondary end point was FIQ total score as measured by weekly recall self-assessment at on-site visits.\nMilnacipran was associated with a higher composite response rate than was placebo (24.2% vs 14.6%; OR=1.9; P=.0003). The FIQ-Total score was significantly improved in patients treated with milnacipran versus those treated with placebo (adjusted mean difference, –3; P=.015). Patients treated with milnacipran demonstrated improvements in pain (morning VAS, P<.0001 vs placebo), quality of life (both mental and physical, as measured by FIQ-Total-Modified and SF-36 mental component score [MCS], P<.01 vs placebo), fatigue (MFI-Total, P<.01 vs placebo), global status (PGIC, P<.0001 vs placebo), and cognition (MASQ-Total, P<.05 vs placebo). Withdrawal of treatment because of adverse events was 22.3% and 9.9% in the milnacipran and placebo groups, respectively. This study demonstrated that milnacipran 200 mg/d improved pain and overall functioning for patients with FMS with minimal side effects.\nMilnacipran was well tolerated in clinical trials. The most frequently reported adverse event was nausea, occurring in 32% to 40% of patients.13 Other common adverse events (incidence ≥5%) were noradrenergic in nature, such as dry mouth, hyperhidrosis, headache, hot flush, and constipation.7,9 In clinical trials, the incidence of early discontinuation of milnacipran because of adverse events was 22% to 27%.10–12\nCompared with TCAs, milnacipran may have fewer anticholinergic and alpha-adrenergic effects.7 Milnacipran may have more noradrenergic effects but fewer serotonergic effects than duloxetine or venlafaxine.7 Milnacipran is unlikely to have a significant effect on cardiac function. In studies, palpitations were reported in 7% to 8% of milnacipran-treated patients.9 This agent does not significantly increase blood pressure, unlike venlafaxine, and has only a minimal association with increases in heart rate.7,9 However, increases in blood pressure and heart rate may occur, and manufacturer labeling recommends monitoring of these parameters.9\nMilnacipran is unlikely to have many pharmacokinetic interactions with concomitant drug therapies because this agent undergoes minimal CYP450 metabolism, is mostly excreted unchanged in the urine, and has low plasma protein binding. Milnacipran may, however, interact with other drugs from a pharmacodynamic perspective.9 Serotonin syndrome may occur when milnacipran is administered with lithium, which impairs serotonin metabolism, or when milnacipran is administered with serotonergic drugs.9 Because milnacipran inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine, caution should be exercised when milnacipran is administered with epinephrine and norepinephrine, as concomitant use may lead to paroxysmal hypertension and arrhythmia; milnacipran may also oppose clonidine's antihypertensive effect.9 Concomitant milnacipran and intravenous digoxin use should be avoided, as coadministration of these agents has been reported to cause postural hypotension and tachycardia.9 Reports of postural hypotension and euphoria have also been documented when clomipramine is replaced with milnacipran.9 As milnacipran is centrally acting, general caution should be exercised when this agent is used with other centrally acting drugs. Concomitant use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) is contraindicated.9\nDr Cios and Dr Kim are senior clinical pharmacists, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.\n1.

What are its Uses and Side-Effects? - Shanghai Chemicals\nKetamine Hydrochloride or Ketamine HCL falls into the categories of drugs that are commonly known as dissociative anesthetics. It is used as a prescriptive drug, especially during surgical procedures, for starting and maintaining anesthesia. It induces loss of consciousness and produces the feeling of relaxation to relieve pain. It is also used as a research chemical in laboratories for a variety of purposes.\nClassified as a class III scheduled drug, Ketamine HCL is only approved for medical and research uses. It should only be used after getting a doctor's prescription under proper medical settings. If not used in a controlled manner, it can cause many health-related and addiction problems. Ketamine's drug abuse potential can create hallucinogenic and dissociative effects on a person. That is why unauthorized selling of Ketamine HCL is restricted in many parts of the world.\nThe main controversy around Ketamine is that in some medical practices, it is used as an off-label medication to treat depression and other related conditions. Off-label drugs are those drugs that are not approved by FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in the United States for medical practices.\nIf you run any medical facility or want to buy this drug for approved medical practices, make sure to find reputed Ketamine HCL manufacturers for your needs. Here at Shanghai Chemicals, we sell high-quality Ketamine Hydrochloride to healthcare providers in the USA, UK, Canada, and China for approved medical practices.\nKetamine is used in veterinary as well as hospitals in various medical settings. It is either injected into muscles using injections or given to patients through an intravenous line in some cases. The most common human medical practices where Ketamine HCL is used during treatment procedures are:\nUses of Ketamine are safe only under approved and prescribed medical practices. Any overdose or uncontrolled use can cause several physical and mental health effects. A person can also witness psychological addiction after the prolonged use of this drug. You can witness the following side-effects due to uncontrolled uses of Ketamine HCL:\nApart from these common side-effects, some people can witness serious side effects including:\nIn case you notice any of the above problems after a treatment involving Ketamine HCL as one of the medications, you should immediately contact your doctor for medical attention.\nPosted in Ketamine HCL manufacturerTagged Ketamine HCL, Ketamine HCL manufacturer, Ketamine HCL manufacturers, Ketamine HCL Provider\nMaassMedia's Lynette Chen Presents at Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab Day | MaassMedia | E-Marketing Analytics\nMaassMedia's Lynette Chen Presents at Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab Day\nLast Monday, the Guardian Mobile Innovation Lab hosted an event in honor of the completion of its 2-year long mobile news delivery experimentation project.\nThroughout the project, MaassMedia partnered with the Lab to develop metrics frameworks, survey questions, and analyses that assessed user engagement with experimental news formats designed specifically for mobile, including their real-time election updates from the U.S. Election, Olympics result notifications during Rio 2016, and several others.\nLynette Chen, Senior Analytics Consultant at MaassMedia, had the opportunity to present our work measuring user engagement with the Guardian mobile experiments.

Elderly patients often do not have access to the range of treatment options available to younger patients. For instance, a study published late last year found that younger patients with advanced NSCLC were three times more likely to receive chemotherapy than were older patients. Besides increased sensitivity to the side effects of platinum-based chemotherapy, elderly patients often have other diseases, as well as diminished physical resilience. Add poor survival prognosis for advanced NSCLC to these factors and the result has been fewer treatment options for elderly lung cancer patients.\nSingle-Agent Chemotherapy Effective in Elderly\nAn article in a recent issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute offers elderly lung cancer patients a chemotherapy regimen that reduces symptoms and treatment side effects and may prolong life. The Elderly Lung Cancer Vinorelbine Italian Study Group (ELVIS) reports on the first multicenter, randomized clinical trial examining single-agent chemotherapy with vinorelbine (Navelbine) in elderly lung cancer patients.\n\"We feel the results of this trial show that treatment with vinorelbine may be a valuable option for elderly non-small-cell lung cancer patients. This is the first treatment option we discuss,\" said principal researcher, Dr. Cesare Gridelli of the Instituto Nazionali per la Studio e la Cura del Tumori in Naples, Italy. Dr. Gridelli and his colleagues recommend that single-agent vinorelbine become the control arm for future studies exploring chemotherapy in elderly lung cancer patients.\nThe ELVIS study divided 161 patients over 70 years of age with late-stage NCSLC into two arms. Patients in the chemotherapy arm received vinorelbine, while those in the control arm received supportive care only. Self-directed questionnaires measured quality-of-life factors. Although the study was flawed by low enrollment, results were encouraging enough to cause researchers to begin administering vinorelbine to patients in the control arm before the study's projected conclusion.\nBesides finding improved quality of life, researchers discovered a clear survival advantage for patients treated waith the vinorelbine regimen compared to those in the control group. Nearly twice as many patients on the vinorelbine arm were alive 1 year into the study. Vinorelbine-treated patients also had fewer of the symptoms of lung cancer, such as pain and shortness of breath. (Of the 78 patients in the vinorelbine group, 5 were removed from the trial due to either severe constipation or arrhythmia.)\nDr. James Rigas, director of thoracic oncology at the Norris Cotton Cancer Center of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, is encouraged by the ELVIS results. \"I am so happy to see this study finally published. I think a lot of physicians were already using vinorelbine for their elderly patients. They knew it was gentler [than mixed-agent chemotherapy] but were unsure if it was really helpful. The ELVIS study shows it increases survival time and maintains good quality of life.\"\nHowever, the perception that chemotherapy is exceedingly harsh persists among many elderly patients, said Dr. Rigas. He hopes more physicians will gain confidence about prescribing vinorelbine and realize the value of getting to know each patient as a unique person. \"I routinely tell elderly lung cancer patients 'we can help you live longer, with fewer symptoms.' Then I find out about their life, what they want to live for, and we decide together what's right for them.\"\nPerspectives of Patients Treated With Vinorelbine\nOne of Dr. Rigas' patients, 73-year-old June Charron of Lyndonville, Vermont, has been living with lung cancer since 1995. She has had two surgeries and two recurrences. When she learned that cancer had returned to both lungs, she was leery of chemotherapy. After consulting with Dr. Rigas, Ms. Charron began treatment with mitomycin (Mutamycin) and vinorelbine but experienced low white blood cell counts and switched to therapy with vinorelbine alone.\n\"It's been over a year now and the cancer hasn't progressed. I go through chills, then hot flashes the day of treatment, once every 4 weeks, but after that I feel fine,\" she said.\nAnother of Dr. Rigas' patients, David Moyer, 73 years old, of Hanover, New Hampshire, began vinorelbine treatments last April, after surgery was ruled out for a tumor in his right lung.\n\"I'm tolerating the Navelbine very well,\" he commented. \"But first, I had a sizable conference with Dr. Rigas. He said the side effects vary from individual to individual. After that talk, I wasn't as apprehensive.\"\nMr. Moyer was fatigued during the first few courses of treatment, but now feels well enough to walk over 2 miles a day. He regards chemotherapy as a holding action. \"This is not going to cure it but maybe it will hold it in check till they find something that will,\" he said.\nAdvocacy Group Praises Study\nPeggy McCarthy, executive director of the Alliance for Lung Cancer Advocacy, Support and Education (ALCASE), praised the ELVIS report as a breakthrough for elderly patients.\n\"This is a very important study and shows that treatment with single-agent chemotherapy is a valid option for elderly patients. We hope this is only the first of many studies in the treatment of lung cancer in the elderly,\" Ms. McCarthy said.\n\"Based on our telephone calls, we know that a large number of elderly patients are told by their diagnosing physician that there is no medical care available for them. This study should be read by every physician who diagnoses and treats lung cancer so that all elderly patients are aware of their treatment options. Not only does single-agent treatment show an acceptable level of side effects and relief of disease-related symptoms, but it may allow older patients to be alive for those moments that matter to them—a grandchild's wedding or great-nephew's graduation.\"\nARS | Publication request: A minimal peach type II chlorophyll a/b-binding protein promoter retains tissue-specificity and light regulation in tomato ARS : Research\n/ Publication #189667 Related Topics\nPrograms and Projects Subjects of Investigation ARS National Programs Search for a research project ARS Office of International Research Programs ARS Office of International Research Programs Regional Contacts ARS Food Security Research ARS International Research Partnerships ARS Biosecurity Engagement Research Title: A minimal peach type II chlorophyll a/b-binding protein promoter retains tissue-specificity and light regulation in tomato\nSrinivasan, Chinnathambi Submitted to: BioMed Central (BMC)Biotechnology\nCitation: Bassett, C.L., Callahan, A.M., Artlip, T.S., Scorza, R., Srinivasan, C. 2007. A minimal peach type II chlorophyll a/b-binding protein promoter retains tissue-specificity and light regulation in tomato. BioMed Central (BMC)Biotechnology. 7:47. Interpretive Summary: The first generation of vectors used in the genetic engineering of agricultural crops promoted expression of the foreign gene in all plant tissues and during most stages of plant development. For the second generation vectors, it is desirable to regulate expression of the inserted gene more precisely in specific tissues/organs and/or during specific stages of development. To obtain precise tissue and developmental expression of a foreign gene, regions of the DNA (promoters) which specify precision expression must be identified, isolated, and used in the new vectors. We describe the isolation of a photosynthetic gene promoter (Cab promoter) which allows expression of attached genes in green tissues, like leaves, stems and young fruit, but which drastically reduces expression in roots and mature fruit. The expression of this promoter from peach was tested in tomato using a reporter gene whose expression was easy to follow. Reporter gene activity was highest in leaves and young (green) fruit, and lowest in roots and mature (red) tomato fruit. Therefore, genes expressed under the control of the peach Cab promoter can be used to express genes in leaves conferring resistance to certain diseases and pests without having these genes expressed in the edible roots or fruits of the engineered plant.\nA minimal peach chlorophyll a/b-binding protein gene (Lhcb2*Pp1) promoter (Cab19) was isolated and fused to a uidA (GUS) gene containing the PIV intron. A control construct carrying an enhanced mas35S CaMV promoter fused to uidA was also constructed. Two different orientations of the Cab19GUS fusion, relative to the right and left borders of the binary vector, were transformed into tomato cv Ailsa Craig and selected on kanamycin. Regenerated transformants testing positive for the presence of GUS or the peach Cab19 promoter were characterized as to their expression patterns in different tomato organs. Ten lines of each construct and an untransformed control line were assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively for GUS expression in leaves and flowers, and quantitatively in roots. Both types of assays indicated higher GUS expression from the mas35S promoter than the Cab19 promoter. Although GUS levels were readily detectable in flowers and roots of mas35S transgenic plants, little activity was observed in plants carrying the Cab19 promoter constructs. GUS activity in transgenic green fruit was relatively high for all promoter constructs; however, in red, ripe fruit, activities were on the whole lower for the Cab19 promoter constructs than the mas35S. GUS activity from transgenic mas35SGUS seedlings exposed to light or kept in the dark was similar among eight lines tested, whereas, activity in dark-grown Cab19GUS seedlings was undetectable. These results indicate that the minimal Cab19 promoter retains both tissue-specificity and light regulation.\nThe College of Engineering (CoE) Research Ethics and Governance Committee (REC) is a sub-committee of the University Research Ethics and Governance Committee and directly reports to it.

        "description": "When will doctors start prescribing 'food as medicine?' - THE UNHIVED MIND IV\nWIRED HEALTH 2016 29 APRIL 16 by MATTHEW REYNOLDS\nhttp://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2016-04/29/food-as-medicine-molly-maloof\nDr Molly Maloof keeps the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley in peak physical condition, but you won't find many pills on her prescriptions.\nYou're more likely to go away from an appointment with Maloof with a new Instagram to check out and five app recommendations. That's because she believes that food is the best medicine.\nEighty per cent of the global disease burden is preventable, Maloof, a health optimisation practitioner, told the audience at WIRED Health. And a large part of that is down to bad diet.\nType two diabetes is perhaps the most prevalent preventable disease – in 2013, 5.1 million people died from diabetes and there are as many as 382 million people currently living with the disease, costing the global economy billions of pounds. The diabetes epidemic is so bad that the UK public health journal The Lancet branded it a \"public health humiliation.\"\nFor Maloof, the answer is simple: \"We need to treat the root cause of our disease with better food.\" That's easier said than done. \"Our bodies tell us that doing the wrong thing feels right and doing the right thing feels wrong,\" warned Maloof.\nUsing drugs to control bodyweight only exacerbates the problem. Statins are commonly prescribed to limit blood cholesterol and lower the risk the risk of heart attacks and strokes, but are also associated with an 12 per cent increased risk of diabetes. \"Are people trading a heart attack for diabetes?\" said Maloof.\nIf drugs can't help us, then it might be time to pay Maloof's clinic a visit. To set her patients on the road to recovery, Maloof prescribes a strict regimen of boxed meal kits (such as Hello Fresh), fresh produce and inspirational food Instagrams. \"For most people, it's simple changes over time that have the biggest result,\" she said.\nBut not all of Maloof's recommendations are openly available on the internet. Her secret weapon? Nutrigenomics. Maloof uses data from genome sequencing companies like 23andMe to produce a diet plan that she claims is unique to your genetic makeup.\nShe also runs micronutrient tests that identify the nutrients her patients are low on and then provides a bespoke diet plan to supplement those deficiencies. Add in quarterly data from blood, saliva and stool samples, and Maloof said she can create a diet plan that responds to minute changes within your body.\nBut a visit to Maloof is only the beginning – her patients have to take control over their own diets to really reap the benefits and there are no quick wins. \"The real blockbuster drug of this century is the activated patient,\" said Maloof. \"They have to want better health.\"\nWhat study materials can a layperson use to gain a deeper understanding of lung cancer? - Medical Sciences Stack Exchange\nI am an outsider to the medical sciences, yet now in desperate need of knowledge to help a family member with lung cancer navigate the difficult medical system in our country. I would like to develop the knowledge to be able to read up on, and have educated discussions on treatment options. I have a great deal of time for reading and am confident of my ability to study the background material.\nAs a layperson, what study materials could help me gain a deeper understanding of lung cancer?\nedited Jan 22 '19 at 0:10\nGenerally, recommendation requests are off topic on almost every SE site. I've posed the question on meta to get a community consensus.\nJan 21 '19 at 14:59\n@JohnP I edited the Q to make it more adherent to site guidelines - though I do realize it is still a recommendations type Q that is by nature opinion-based, I feel it had potential to help others seek knowledge on their own.\n@Gordon The article you linked to seems reasonable, but the site in general is a bunch of click bait. (That's why they broke the article into 11 pages unnecessarily - to present more ads.) The same information can be found on more reputable sites that don't sell supplements. We prefer such sites here. Also, answering in comments is to be avoided.\nJan 22 '19 at 2:08\n@DoctorWhom this is much better. I think the consensus is that recommendation requests are off topic, but this I think dodges that nicely.\nCancer can be one of the most complicated concepts in medicine, not only because of the pathophysiology of cancer, but the complicated statistics involved in the epidemiology of the diseases and interpreting the results of studies on treatments.\nIf your previous studies have been completely outside of the biological sciences, it will be very difficult to gain the degree of understanding that you seem to want. Even if you have some biology background, at best, you should definitely not expect to gain the expertise to confidently second-guess actual medical providers.\nHowever, I applaud you for your desire to understand as much as possible, and you certainly may be able to learn enough to follow along in conversations about risks and benefits of different treatment options, and to have educated discussions about what is going on with your loved one.\nYou might FIRST START with patient education websites from the NIH or CDC on the basics of lung cancer, then fill in the gaps of details and background needed using textbooks on the underlying concepts.\nFor that, these are some of the more popular texts used in medical school, if you are able to get your hands on them, which have good sections on lung cancer.\nRobbins and Cotran: Pathological Basis for Disease (or Robbins Basic Pathology)\nWest: Pulmonology Physiology and also Pathophysiology\nAdvancing your understanding of the mechanisms underlying cancer development and progression:\nPathoma (the sections on oncogenesis are fantastic)\nI would also do some reading on how to interpret the statistics pertinent to cancer, such as odds ratio, relative risk, number needed to treat, sensitivity/specificity, incidence, mortality rates, 5 year survival rates, etc. Statistics are not taught well in most schools these days and additional knowledge is important to being able to understand how decisions are made.\nanswered Jan 21 '19 at 10:30\nNot the answer you're looking for?

In the past several weeks, everyone's lives have been turned upside down. COVID-19 literally hit home when my daughter, Jessa, contracted the virus and experienced all the classic symptoms, including the rapidly progressing acute lung distress. Praise be to God; she has recovered as rapidly as her condition progressed. The onset of her condition forced me to gain as much knowledge as quickly as possible to decrease the rapidly developing \"cytokine storm\" that I saw coming on. As you may know this cytokine storm is the cause of the respiratory failure seen in so many people who have unfortunately succumbed to their illness. I spent the next several days immersed in books, webinars, podcasts, and internet searches and I wish to share the information I have learned with all of you.\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus binds to ACE-2 receptors on the cells, highest in the heart, lungs, kidneys, and vascular cells, lymph, and spleen.\nAfter binding the body's immune response is to release inflammatory chemicals called cytokines. This process is upregulated leading to fever, body aches, but also a possible massive infiltrative process in the lungs. This could in some (not most) lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\nThe level of \"cytokine storm\" is under the control of Inflammasomes. The more inflammation reaction, the greater the chance for cytokine storm and increased risk of death from coronavirus. The two cytokines that seem to be most upregulated are IL-1B, IC-6, IFN-y, TNF-a. One particular cytokine-like protein has been implicated in sepsis-induced cytokine storms: High mobility group Box 1 protein (HMGB1). The higher the cytokine level, the higher the HMGB1is. These HMGB1 levels at peak will last 18 hours before they begin to decline. When HMGB1 is expressed in lung tissue it causes massive neutrophil (white blood cell) into the lungs and acute lung injury. As the storm progresses respiratory failure (requiring mechanical ventilation), acute renal failure and systemic shock all occur.\nPossible Coronavirus Intervention\nA. Inhibit Inflammasomes that Initiate Cytokine Cascade\nVitamin C Blocks Inflammasomes. Many have heard IV Vit C was highly effective in a Chinese study to halt coronavirus and is now being utilized in U.S. hospitals to treat acute coronavirus.\nMelatonin. Blocks inflammasomes and is highest in young people and lowest in older people. Electropollution from EMFs such as Wi-Fi, cell phones, iPads, computers, and all cell phone towers have been proven to interfere with pineal gland function and decreasing melatonin.\nNitric oxide.

Currently, there is no vaccine and often testing is reserved for only the extremely ill. So, with this understood it behooves us to take a strong stance with general wellness and health to also bolster a strong immune defense. You may be asking, \"What else can I do?\".\nGet plenty of sleep. Study after study suggests sleep boosts immunity via several mechanisms.\nEat a healthy nutritious diet. Garbage in/garbage out. Your immunity will be garbage if you don't eat well. One serving of sugar can decrease white blood cell function by 50% for 8 hours. Foods high in sulforaphane such as broccoli and brussels sprouts are a good choice because they help decrease IL-6 that contributes to the cytokine storm. Garlic and onions have antiviral activity. Fruit, foods high in anthocyanins and polyphenols such as blueberries, elderberry, cinnamon, and grapes help block viral docking on the ACE-2 receptor.\nExercise. Daily exercise with some kind of movement has been proven over and over to help boost immunity. It also helps with proper lymphatic motion to prevent toxic stagnation.\nCheck your Mental Health. These are very trying times for all, and anxiety and fear will weaken your immune system. Anxiety is fostered by an unknown future and certainly, we are all facing many unknowns. I take comfort in my faith knowing that I can control only what is in my control and the rest I leave for God. My own beliefs have encouraged me to \"stay in peace\" during times of trouble. Instead of focusing on your uncertainties, shift your consciousness to greater mankind and consider donating money or time and help one another in any way you can. Maybe this will be how the world will truly heal!\nBasic Immune Supplemental Support \"If you're not sick with COVID-19.\"\nVitamin C – preferably buffered 4000 mg/day\nVitamin D3 – preferably emulsified 4000 IU/day\nElderberry syrup 1 tsp. 2x/day not with cytokine storm\nGlutathione – preferably liposomal 1 tsp/day\nLauricidin (monolaurin) – 1 scoop/day\nIf you are a patient of Dr. Arne's or Dr. Herzog's and are interested in further information regarding this post, a telehealth conference with your chiropractor may be scheduled for further assistance with proper immune support for your specific health needs.

Webster, opinion contributor — 11/16/17 05:40 PM EST\nA recent New York Times op-ed by Nicolas Kristof, \"Drug Dealers in Lab Coats,\" begins by citing \"63,000\" drug overdose deaths in 2016. In the next sentence, Kristof implies that these were exclusively opioid-related deaths. But they weren't. The 63,000 drug-related deaths involved all drugs including cocaine, benzodiazepines, and methamphetamines.\nIn a recent story, CNN also misreported the data. To quote the original story, \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects opioid overdose deaths to top 64,000 in 2016 when the numbers are finalized.\" To its credit, CNN corrected the error and modified the statement to say the number reflected \"drug overdoses.\" CNN also added the sentence, \"Most of these overdoses involved an opioid.\" But this was after the inaccurate information had been posted online and was widely read.\nThe Los Angeles Times unabashedly claimed that the opioid crisis \"killed more than 64,000 Americans\" last year. That is also untrue.\nGovernor Chris Christie explained his belief recently on National Public Radio (NPR) that opioids kill 175 Americans each day. If true, that would mean there would be a total of 63,875 opioid-related deaths in one year. The Washington Post cites the 175 deaths per day as well. Again, the data does not support these statements.\nWe've grown so used to hearing about the opioid crisis that, when we hear about drug overdoses, it's easy to reach the conclusion that the words \"opioids\" and \"drugs\" mean the same thing. However, they do not. Many media reports — and the ones I cited above are just a sampling —obfuscate that fact. Intelligent media consumers, as well as policymakers, can become confused.\nThere is additional confusion associated with opioid painkillers and illicit opioids. Though both are opioids, the first group is used for a legitimate medical purpose while the second group is not.\nSo let's be clear about this. When we read that there have been 63,000 or 64,000 drug overdose deaths, that does not mean they are deaths from prescription opioids.\nAlthough most drug overdoses involve an opioid, that includes opioids without a medical purpose such as heroin and synthetic fentanyl products that found their way to America from China and Mexico.\nPrescription painkillers certainly contribute to the crisis, but it is impossible to determine the extent to which they are involved for at least two reasons. First, heroin is metabolized into morphine which is often mis-categorized as a prescription opioid at autopsy.\nTo further complicate matters, fentanyl can be either prescribed for pain or smuggled from foreign countries. So, while a fentanyl-related death may be appropriately counted as a prescription opioid death, most of the increase in overdoses is from illegal fentanyl analogues.\nResearching this article and ensuring its accuracy was difficult, because the available information is incomplete and, in some cases, conflicting. That said, the preliminary 2016 reports of drug overdoses indicate that about 3 out of 4, or 75 percent, of drug-related deaths appear to involve a substance other than a prescribed opioid. Therefore, of the estimated 63,000 overdose deaths, only 1 out of 4 (or 25 percent) — that is, 16,000 — are associated with prescription opioids.\nWe need to recognize that the opioid epidemic has shifted away from prescription opioids. The number of recent overdoses of non-prescription drugs have eclipsed the original problem of prescribed painkillers.\nYet, most reports, including the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis, conflate the overdose data into one alarming figure that misleads policymakers into proposing interventions that don't address the primary source of the problem.\nThe approach we are taking is dangerous, because attempting to curb the number of drug deaths by hyper-focusing on prescription opioids is like calling the fire department to extinguish one house fire while the surrounding three houses next door burn to the ground.\nPreventing every overdose death is important, whether or not it involves prescribed opioids.\nPresident Trump has missed an opportunity to redirect his commission to address the larger drug crisis. We know he pays attention to the media.\nLet's hope the media will be more discerning with its reporting and ask policymakers what they are doing about the tragic overdose problem from drugs that are not prescription opioids.\nLynn R.

Most people will need a four-week course. Your symptoms should pass within two weeks, but it's very important that you finish the course of antibiotics to prevent the infection returning.\nNote that many spouses do drainage themselves to help their husbands reduce prostatitis symptoms. Many men with prostatitis have managed to conceive children.\nProstatitis is not caused by sexual abstinence. Male body accommodates itself to such situation and adjusts the sexual function. On the contrary, an active sexual life or uncontrolled sexual behavior often cause prostatitis, because men may easily get STDs and, consequently, prostatitis. By no means always.\nStress can have a significant impact on both types of Prostatitis. It worsens the symptoms of bacterial Prostatitis, but it also has a role in non-bacterial Prostatitis. The association between psychological disorders and chronic pelvic pain (CP) has recently garnered much attention.\nAcute prostatitis starts quickly. Long-term (chronic) prostatitis lasts for 3 months or more. Ongoing irritation of the prostate that is not caused by bacteria is called chronic nonbacterial prostatitis.\nAre You Sure That's What the Doctor Said About Your Leukemia? – AHealthyMe – Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts\nTHURSDAY, Nov. 2, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- The stress of a frightening leukemia diagnosis may impede clear doctor-patient communication, a new study suggests.\nPatients undergoing chemotherapy treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tend to view their illness and prognosis through a different lens from their doctors, researchers say.\nInvestigators found that patients are inclined to overestimate their risk of dying due to treatment and, at the same time, overestimate their chances for a full cure.\n\"Patients with AML face very challenging treatment decisions that are often placed upon them within days after being diagnosed,\" said senior study author Dr. Areej El- Jawahri.\n\"Because they face a grave decision, they need to understand what the risks of treatment are versus the possibility of a cure,\" said El-Jawahri, an assistant professor of medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\nAdult AML is a type of cancer generally seen in older people in which the bone marrow makes abnormal white blood cells, red blood cells or platelets. Chemotherapy, radiation, drug therapy or a stem cell transplant can be used as treatment, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\nInvestigators focused on 100 AML patients. Half were in intensive care for four to six weeks, while the other half were mostly treated as outpatients. On average, patients were 71 years old.\nRoughly three days after starting treatment, the patients and their doctors completed surveys.\nMore than 6 out of 10 patients said it was \"somewhat likely\" they would die because of treatment, and almost 30 percent said it was \"extremely likely\" they would die. However, 8 in 10 of the cancer doctors said that scenario was very unlikely.\nAnother survey one month later revealed other misunderstandings. While 90 percent of patients believed it was either somewhat or very likely they would ultimately be cured, three-quarters of the doctors thought it was somewhat or very unlikely that a cure was in the offing.\nThe gap was especially wide between doctors and outpatients. Researchers found 44 percent of outpatients thought they were very likely achieve a cure, but none of the doctors shared that view.\nThe five-year survival rate for people with AML is approximately 27 percent, according to the American Cancer Society.\nThe findings were recently presented at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and other groups, in San Diego.\n\"There were several very important factors we were not able to capture in our study, including what was actually discussed between patients and their oncologists, and whether patients simply misunderstood or misheard the information conveyed to them,\" El-Jawahri said in a meeting news release.\nStill, the urgency of decision-making required with AML may contribute to differences in perception, the researchers said. Previous work with patients treated for other types of cancer didn't uncover such pronounced distortions.\nSince 1982, Uncas Veterinary Clinic has provided exceptional service and personalized care to each and every patient.

The HS Program will centralize a network of dermatologists, plastic surgeons, nutritionists, gastroenterology specialists, and psychologists with expertise in managing HS.\nHS is a chronic inflammatory disease with recurrent abscesses in areas including the underarms, breasts, groin, and/or buttocks. It can cause considerable scarring and, in more severe cases, create sinus tracts (infection-prone channels) and fistulae (abnormal passageways connecting multiple abscesses). At its worst, HS is a painful, psychologically damaging, physically debilitating condition.\n\"Despite the fact that HS is a very common disease with devastating consequences, its awkward name is unfamiliar to the public and to most health care workers,\" said Dr. Steven Cohen, Professor of Medicine and Chief of the Division of Dermatology. \"More often than not, HS has a hugely negative impact on quality of life.\"\nWhile its cause(s) remain poorly understood, HS is considered by physicians and investigators to be a primary disease of the hair follicles. Given that a third of patients have one or more relatives who are also affected, a genetic mutation may also be involved.\nMichelle A. Lowes, MD, PhD\nThe Hidradenitis Suppurativa Program, including HS Treatment and Research Centers, is co-directed by Dr. Cohen and Dr. Michelle Lowes. Dr. Cohen specializes in the care of patients with HS and has been awarded grants to develop an HS Registry and Quality of Life Study to better understand the nature of this devastating disease. Dr. Lowes joined Montefiore Einstein in October 2014 as Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine, bringing a longstanding dermatological research background with focus on chronic immunological skin diseases. Educated and trained in Australia, she was formerly with the Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology at Rockefeller University.\nDr. Cohen and Dr. Lowes conceived the HS Treatment Program after observing unusually large and increasing numbers of patients with the disease in Montefiore's outpatient facilities throughout the Bronx. \"We feel the HS Program will enable us to provide the highest quality care for victims of the disease, including the broadest range of medical, psychological, nutritional, and surgical treatment options,\" said Dr. Cohen.\nThe Center's innovative, patient-tailored treatment approach may include minor surgery or medications such as topical and oral antibiotics, vitamin A analogues, and anti-TNF biologics. Laser and/or plastic reconstructive surgery may be involved in severe cases. Services for weight loss and smoking cessation (both known to exacerbate HS), pain management, and a support group for patients living with HS will also be integrated into the program.\nThe HS Treatment Program, located at the Montefiore Hutchinson Campus (Hutchinson Metro Center, 1250 Waters Place), accepts patients on alternate Monday mornings beginning Monday, April 13. Patients who wish to make an appointment, and physicians interested in referring patients or becoming involved in the Center, should contact Dr. Lowes (mlowes@montefiore.org) or Dr. Cohen (srcohen@montefiore.org).\nFrench regulator says up to 4,100 children victims of epilepsy drug | GulfNews.com\nApril 20, 2018 | Last updated 58 minutes ago\nValproate was approved as an anti-epileptic drug in France in 1967\nPublished: 17:22 April 20, 2017\nParis: An estimated 2,150 to 4,100 children in France suffered a major malformation in the womb between 1967 and 2016 after their mothers took a treatment against epilepsy and bipolar disorders known as valproate, France's drug regulator said on Thursday.\nValproate, which has been manufactured in France by Sanofi under the brand Depakine in the field of epilepsy and Depakote and Depamide in bipolar disorders, is also believed to cause slow neurological development.\nANSM, France's drug authority, said it would also publish a study on neurological effects in the second half of 2017.\nValproate was approved as an anti-epileptic drug in France in 1967 and has become one of the most widely prescribed treatments for the condition worldwide.\nParents of those affected say the French state and Sanofi were too slow to warn of the side effects of the drug, after the risks to foetuses became clear by the early 1980s.\nOmlek-D Capsule | Price,Uses,Side Effects | Drugcarts\nOmlek-D Capsule\nYou Save : Rs.5.65 Inclusive of all taxes\nMedical Description of Omlek-D Capsule\nOmlek-D Capsule contains Omeprazole 20mg and Domperidone 10mg .

What do they have in common? Intense colour pigments that attach to the outer surface of your tooth (enamel).\nTwo chemicals found in tobacco create stains: Tar and nicotine.\nBelow the hard, white outer surface of your teeth (enamel) is a softer area called dentin. Over the years, the outer enamel layer gets thinner, making yellowish dentin more visible.\nTeeth can also change colour due to medication, but they get a more gray tint rather than yellow. Tooth darkening can be a side effect of certain prescription drugs such as antihistamines, antipsychotics, and high blood pressure tablets. Young children who are exposed to antibiotics like tetracycline may notice discolouration of their adult teeth later in life. Chemotherapy and head and neck radiotherapy can also darken teeth.\nConcerns regarding the safety of all whitening treatments and products have existed for a long time but were amplified since the introduction of methods for bleaching at-home.\nThe most broadly known active ingredient in whitening materials is the peroxide, which is the compound that raises most concerns. However, results from numerous studies show that, when used correctly, peroxide-based tooth whitening is safe and effective.\nThe side effects that are most commonly seen are tooth sensitivity and gingival irritation, which are usually mild to moderate and transient. So far there is no evidence of significant health risks associated with tooth whitening.\nPotential adverse effects can occur with the inappropriate application, abuse, or the use of inappropriate whitening products.\nThe answer unfortunately is no. Tooth whitening will not permanently whiten and brighten your teeth, unless it is properly maintained. The correct aftercare instructions by the dentist and the patient's commitment and compliance using the top up prescription is the secret that leads to a brilliant smile for several years in the future.\nThe longevity of your bright new smile will depend on the reduction of the staining substances, foods and drinks that take away your hard earned results. The dentist should give a list of all the products that cause tooth darkening and the patient should only consume these in moderation, if not at all.\nWhat Can I Do To Maintain A White Smile After Whitening?\nThe way you take care of your teeth after your dental whitening treatment will dramatically extend or diminish the longevity of your white smile. Some professional whitening kits that you get from your dentist's office will come with an aftercare packet that you can use to enhance your smile between whitening treatments. Complying with your top prescription and using whitening gel in regular intervals as prescribed by your dentist, will make your vibrant smile a long-lasting one.\nYou should also be conscious of your eating and hygiene habits since they could also impact the longevity of your results. Drink water regularly to keep your mouth flushed, and practice proper oral hygiene to prevent your teeth from yellowing.\nNote that your teeth will be particularly sensitive to stains for the first two days after teeth whitening so be extra careful!\nA research team led by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital immunologists has discovered how a set of proteins delays the \"executioner\" machinery that kills damaged or infected cells in a process called necroptosis. The scientists believe the finding may have wide clinical implications if researchers can develop drugs to control the cellular rescue machinery.\nRescue treatments that prevent necroptosis in transplanted organs could reduce injury to the transplant caused by lack of oxygen, researchers said. Drugs to rescue cells from necroptosis could also help prevent injuries to tissue deprived of blood by heart attack and stroke. In such cases, restoring blood flow and oxygenation triggers inflammation that kills tissue.\nThe researchers said cell-rescuing drugs could also thwart cancer spread by protecting blood vessel cells from being killed by tumor cells. Tumor cells escape the bloodstream to spread in the body by killing blood vessels. Blocking the rescue machinery might also prove useful in treating cancers, by enhancing death of cancer cells by necroptosis.\nIn treating neurodegenerative disorders such as ALS–also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease–activating the rescue machinery could help prevent death of brain cells.\nAnd in treating viral infections such as influenza, rescue treatment could extend the life of cells infected by the virus, so that the body's immune system would be more strongly alerted to fight the infection.\nThe researchers were led by Douglas Green, Ph.D., chair of the St. Jude Department of Immunology. The first author was Yi-Nan Gong, Ph.D., a scientist in Green's laboratory. The research appears in the journal Cell.\nScientists knew that the \"executioner\" in necroptosis was a protein called MLKL. When MLKL is activated by the necroptosis machinery, it triggers a piercing of the plasma membrane surrounding the cell, ultimately killing it. However, the St. Jude scientists discovered how cells could survive necroptosis.\nResearchers showed the plasma membrane could repair itself by forming \"bubbles\" of broken plasma membrane that would shed from the cell to repair the holes.\nExperiments showed the set of proteins called ESCRT-III was responsible for forming the repair bubbles. The research also revealed that ESCRT-III delayed or prevented necroptosis by repairing breaks in the plasma membrane. The delay gave the dying cells time to release signals to alert surrounding cells to the presence of a viral infection.\nThe investigators also discovered that activating MLKL is not a point of no return for cell survival, and that ESCRT-III could resuscitate damaged cells.\nIn experiments relevant to transplantation, the researchers measured levels of activated MLKL protein in tissue samples from kidneys used in transplants. Such cells experience stress during the transplantations, and researchers suspected the cells would show signs of necroptosis. The scientists found that although MLKL was activated in the kidney cells after transplantation, the cells did not die, and this protection correlated with an increase in the levels of the ESCRT-III machinery necessary for rescue of cells with active MLKL.\nGreen emphasized that the current findings are only \"suggestive\" at this point, because the experiments were done in cell cultures and tissue samples. Further studies are needed to establish that the rescue machinery functions in whole organs. For example, the researchers are working with clinicians to explore whether ESCRT-III could aide transplant survival.\nThe research by Green and his colleagues will also aim at discovering the biological signals regulating ESCRT-III, to enable more precise control of the rescue machinery. Those studies could yield drugs to regulate the rescue process, Green said.\nThe Green laboratory has a long history of pioneering research into the two forms of cell death–apoptosis and necroptosis. In 1995, Green and his colleagues discovered a hallmark event characteristic of apoptosis. That event is the movement of a fatty molecule called phosphatidylserine from the inside of the plasma membrane to the outside. This study established the phosphatidylserine movement as a hallmark of necroptosis.\nThe work was supported by the National Institutes of Health and ALSAC, the fundraising organization of St. Jude.\nCredit: Harriet de Wit Although cannabis, also known as marijuana, has been shown to impair memory, reaction…\nBy joining our friends scheme, this item would only cost £58.50, and you can benefit from future savings and promotions.\nThis new volume in the SCM Research series argues that both preaching and Action Research are inherently exposing practices. They require a deep level of self-consciousness, and a willingness to hold oneself up to critique and comment. But at their best they are both formed within a deep and supportive critical community.\nApplying a methodology rooted in Action Research as way of Doing Theology (ART), and drawn from the author's own research within a specific 'community of practice', The Naked Preacher demonstrates for preachers and ministers new ways to be critically and constructively self-aware. It also offers an important contribution for practical theologians with an interest in action research and critical reflection.\nRev Dr Jason C. Boyd is Minister of Witney Congregational Church, and a tutor in theology on the Congregational Federation Foundation Degree.\n'Jason Boyd has engaged in a radical examination of his preaching practice, not as mere upskilling but as rigorous and reflective theological inquiry. In doing so he has explored and reframed what it is to do theology in the practice of his preaching and, thereby, contribute to the field of practical theology.' -- David Coghlan\n'Jason Boyd offers a fresh and compelling model of preaching as democratic hermeneutics and everyday liberation. It encourages preaching as an event that is at once both orthodox and existential, and allows for the meaning making and wisdom to be shared horizontally, not vertically, as a means of equipping the body of Christ to attain a deeper relevance and desire for discipleship in today's complex world.' -- Chris Baker\nSeptember 2017: Olygose announced the release of two new publications confirming the safety of plant-based galacto-oligosaccharides evaluated during a 90-day sub-chronic toxicity test in rats (OECD guideline 408) and a repeated dose study in piglets.\nThe two manuscripts have been published in Toxicology Research and Application during summer and are available at http://journals.sagepub.com/toc/TOR/current.\nThe 90-day sub-chronic toxicity trial, performed with CiToxLAB (France), aimed at providing information on health hazard likely to arise from exposure to plant-based GOS via oral administration and indicated that the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for Olygose plant-based GOS is greater than 2000 mg/kg/day.\nThe neonatal piglet trial, performed with Experimur (USA), demonstrated that plant-based GOS incorporated at a level of 8 g/L in a formula (the maximum dose of prebiotic substance added to infant formulas) was well tolerated and did not cause harmful effects. The neonatal piglet is the best translational model available to date to evaluate the safety of new substances aimed at being incorporated in infant formulas.\nOlygose plant-based GOS are produced in France thanks to a proprietary technology resulting in very pure ingredients suitable for a number of applications in the field of foods, beverages and supplements. They are currently marketed in Europe and the US under different brand names, namely AlphaGOS® for prebiotic and symbiotic formulations, CravingZ’Gone® for satiety and weight management and P-GOS® for infant nutrition applications.\nFrançois Delbaere, CEO of Olygose: “We have reached an important milestone with the publication of this safety data set. The excellent safety profile observed will definitely support the expansion of our presence on the market and greatly facilitate the regulatory challenges that any company that is involved in specialized nutrition markets, such as infant nutrition, has to face”.\nThis website uses some cookies.

In short, the drug is a synthetic version of marijuana. Spice/K2 produces similar effects to weed but can be much more harmful than natural cannabis due to the chemicals added to the drug. In July 2017, more than 100 people in the same Pennsylvania town overdosed in a three-day span. Newark, New Jersey, had more than 70 overdoses in April of the same year and another 40 in August. According to a New York Times article, a one-week stretch in 2016 in the state resulted in 130 overdoses on K2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that from January to May of 2015 there were 15 deaths related to Spice misuse.The legal status of the drug is often discussed and mistaken. While some people call it \"legal weed,\" the drug, on its own, is not approved by the Drug Enforcement Administration. However, variations of the drug have been produced that are legal, which makes this particular substance a special case from a legal standpoint.\nSpice continues to evolve and new chemicals are added and tinkered with to produce new variations of the drug. The Office of the National Drug Control Policyreported that 51 new synthetic cannabinoids were recognized in 2012, and in the last six years even more have been introduced.\nSpice/K2 addiction forms when people misuse the drug over a long period of time and increase dosage and frequency. Since the drug is similar to marijuana — and has the nicknames of \"fake weed\" and \"synthetic weed\" — some of the effects are comparable and people take the drug to achieve the same high associated to all-natural cannabis.Once people take the drug enough, their bodies become accustomed to the feeling and the high has a lesser effect despite the dosage remaining the same. This requires a larger amount or more frequent misuse to achieve the same effects, meaning the body has built a tolerance for the drug.\nSince the drug is still new, not much is known about the long-term side effects of Spice/K2 misuse and addiction. However, the drug's variance in chemicals and ingredients creates health risks for people who experiment and take the substance consistently. Many people have overdosed on the drug, which has been attributed to many deaths since its inception around 2010.Permanent brain damage, kidney damage, psychotic episodes and hallucinations are some of the likely side effects for people who have misused the drug over a long period of time. Other side effects that could become long-term disorders and issues for people who take K2/Spice include anxiety, depression and paranoia.\nWe are happy to announce the publication of the NICE guideline on Faltering Growth developed by the National Guideline Alliance (NGA).

        "description": "Advancements In Medical Technology – Jediland Psychiatric Services\ne prescribing software\tadmin\t 11 months ago October 26, 2020\nThere is a lot to be said when we look at medication and healthcare. For many people, the battle for better healthcare is a day to day event. With innovations to be able to take your temperature without a thermometer or create a medication that cures a disease that killed millions, it just amazes people that we can do so many things in healthcare.\nOne thing that we all have to do is deal with medications. When we take medications we are taking substances that have been shown to alleviate pain and other symptoms we begin to experience. With the introduction of e prescribing software, doctors are now able to write a prescription, send it to a pharmacy and they are able to fill it quickly, and have it ready by the time you leave your appointment.\nWith our technology today we are now able to get a wealth of information from a single drop of blood including the likelihood to be vulnerable to a disease or illness and even the ability to change your blood so it can help others who are suffering from illnesses.\nThere are also shorter recovery times when it comes to medical procedures. In the past, we would have a surgery to our legs or back and be down and out for months recovering. With today's advancement in technology we can have those same procedures done and be back to work the next day.\nWhen we look at recovery times, they have made it possible to have more procedures done than ever before. With more people being able to recoup at home, the space is now available for them to use.\nLonger and more productive lives\nFinally, we are now in an age where we are living longer and much healthier. As a result, we can really take advantage of our health and quality of life.\nThe Best Way to Recover After Working Out - Copper Fit\nFriday, Oct 15, 2021 4 min read\nThe Best Way to Recover After Working Out\nAfter a long, grueling workout, do you: 1. take a hot shower and collapse on the couch or 2. use your foam roller and fill your body with healthy protein and carbs.\nEven though you might want to do #1, your body will thank you if you do #2.\nWhy? Muscle recovery – it's healing your muscle fibers as they rebuild.\nMuscle recovery isn't just sitting in a bathtub. You can take steps to take an ACTIVE role in the recovery process, ease the after-workout pain and help your muscles heal - and build more efficiently.\nWhat happens to muscles during an intense workout?\nMuscles get broken down during exercise, and they actually form tiny tears. These small tears are perfectly normal, and the size depends on how intense the workout is.\nThis is when it's essential to find the right balance in your workout: ​​The bigger the tear, the sorer the muscles, and you can over-train, and that can result in a muscle strain or rupture.\nHow does the muscle build?\nTears disrupt the muscle cell organelles, which activate cells outside the muscle fiber to help with the damage. These cells mature into grown cells and fuse to the muscle fibers. This creates new muscle protein strands, which means stronger muscle fiber. It also means that your muscles become more resilient, and you won't get as sore next time!\nWhat is active recovery for muscles?\nKnowing that muscles tear make it more apparent that you need to allow your muscles to repair fully after a workout, or you will likely cause injury the next time you are in the gym.\nRecovery isn't just about kicking up your feet and turning on Netflix; instead, you can take action - it's called active recovery. And it helps; if you don't allow your muscles to repair fully, you will likely cause injury.\nThere are simple things you should be doing anyway for overall health, but especially helpful after a big workout, and a few things that are worth a try as well.\nFirst off, recovery needs to have the three basics met first: food, water, and sleep.\nThis may be the most significant part of recovery. During sleep, the body produces most of its Growth Hormone (GH) that aids in daily muscle repair and recovery and are primarily responsible for tissue growth and repair. Healing happens at night, so make sure you are getting 7-9 hours!\nWater supports every metabolic function and nutrient transfer in the body. Having plenty of water will improve every bodily function - not to mention the need to replace the water you lost to sweat! Dehydration can impair your muscles' ability to repair themselves.\nFood truly is medicine, and putting the right food in your body after a workout can provide your body with what it needs to repair muscles and promote recovery. Protein is a huge component of that, and consuming protein after your training can help to repair muscle damage. When muscles are exhausted and hungry, the glucose from carbs and lots of protein improves efficiency. A whole-foods-based diet rich in antioxidants, whole carbohydrates, and lean protein Is always a good idea for optimal recovery.\nIn addition to those \"basics\" of active recovery, here are three things that athletes use on the regular for recovery: compression, myofascial release, and COLD water:\nCompression products provide support to the repairing muscles when dealing with pain. They can help to reduce swelling and inflammation - which intensify the pain. They may also support the improved circulation and improve the flow of freshly oxygenated blood, which is needed for tissue repair and healing, reducing the muscles' recovery time. Some compression aids have cold or heat packs. When tissue is damaged with a muscle strain that causes inflammation and swelling, it is an excellent time to ice the muscle. Heat packs work best for injuries at least a few days old by opening blood vessels, assisting the healing process, and alleviating some of your pain. In addition, keeping the muscles warm can help to prevent further strain and fatigue.\n5. Myofascial Release: Massage and Foam Rolling\nDoing either of these two immediately before or after exercise may help decrease soreness and speed muscle recovery.\nAfter a workout, the idea is that myofascial release increases blood flow to the tissues you just used and can help speed up recovery time. Need a further reason to spend the money on massage? A 2020 review of studies support that massage improved flexibility and decreased delayed onset muscle soreness after exercise.\n6. Cold, Cold Water\nBRRR. This sounds horrible, but there is a reason you see elite athletes dumping themselves into an ice bath. Repeatedly constricting and dilating blood vessels helps remove (or flush out) waste products in the tissues. They can reduce pain, inflammation, and muscle tiredness after strenuous activity. Maybe this isn't for everyone - but you can get results from a cold shower too!\nAnd just know - maybe it's time to break from strenuous workouts if extreme muscle soreness lasts for more than three or four days. How is your body responding to your workouts? Remember, your ideal training today might change, and that's ok too! The essential component, always, is to pay attention to your body and how you feel.\nHow to Manage Your Holiday Gift Giving Anxiety\nDon't let holiday gift giving stress you out.

Here is your checklist for keeping your stress level low so you can focus on what's important.\nAre You Working from Home?

Detailed information on TBE cases in eleven European countries and reported to the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) were obtained and mapped. TBE risk maps are available for these eleven countries.\nA TBE review was also undertaken to determine the epidemiology of TBE across the main area of distribution of TBE across Europe and Asia.\nWhere limited information was available for a country, recommendations were formed by consensus opinion based on the most recent available information.\nCountry specific regional information has been reviewed and updated where necessary for the following countries: Albania, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bulgaria, China (incl. Tibet), Croatia, Czech Rep., Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Mongolia, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine.\nCountry specific regional information has also been updated for the following countries where vaccination is sometimes considered for travellers, but not normally given: France, Greece and Japan and Netherlands.\nCountries with a new tick awareness recommendation, but not a vaccine recommendation on the \"Other Risk\" section of the NaTHNaC country information pages include: Afghanistan, Belgium, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, South Korea and Turkey.\nTBE is a viral infection transmitted by the bite of infected ticks or less commonly, following ingestion of unpasteurised milk products.\nTBE is a vaccine preventable disease. Areas where TBE occurs exist within a band that extends from central, eastern and northern Europe across Russia to parts of eastern Asia. These areas are generally at altitudes lower than 1500m, however TBE has been known to occur at higher altitudes in these areas. In Europe, early spring through to late autumn are generally higher risk, but seasons vary according to location. Travellers are at increased risk of exposure during outdoor activities in areas of vegetation (gardens, parks, meadows, forest fringes and glades).\navoid known heavily tick-infested areas of forest and woodland from early spring through to late autumn where possible.\npractise bite avoidance methods: for example wear appropriate clothing and use effective insect repellents\nTypically TBE disease occurs in two stages. The first stage is a mild-flu like illness. The second stage is a potentially serious infection of the central nervous system.\nTravellers at risk of disease. The risk of acquiring TBE infection is dependent on a number of factors including:\nWhen undertaking TBE risk assessment, health professionals should refer to the individual Country Information pages, where there are details relating to risk areas in a country and the necessary prevention measures including whether vaccination is recommended.\nIN THIS ARTICLE: Find out which strains it contains, possible benefits for your health and what customers are saying about Complete Probiotics Platinum.\n1MD claims this product will nourish and optimise your digestive and immune systems by balancing the friendly bacteria in your body, helping you to feel healthier, naturally.

The formula entered in cell B3 must be such that it can be copied to B4 and B5 without further editing. Let Excel use relative cell references to produce the correct result.\nThe formula to place in cell B3 of the Search worksheet will have the following structure:\n=INDEX(array,MATCH(locate row),MATCH(locate column))\nwhere array is practically the entire Personal worksheet (see the already defined named ranges provided in Lab6_Ex7.xls). MATCH(locate row) returns the position of the SIN (cell B2 in the Search worksheet) in column D of the Personal worksheet. This gives the row index into the array. MATCH(locate column) returns the position of the corresponding label in column A of the Search worksheet in the titles found across the first row of the Personal worksheet. This gives the column index of the desired component. Column 1 is the Student #, column 2 is the Last Name, and column 3 is the First Name.\nMinor suggestion: From personal experience I've found that sometimes Excel will not properly recognize typed data regardless of how correct it might appear. So, when creating the Search worksheet, instead of typing in the labels found in column A, copy and paste these labels one by one from the first row of the Personal worksheet. This guarantees that they will match properly.\nCarefully study the online documentation for MATCH. Every function has online documentation, just follow the link \"help on this function\" found at the bottom left of the \"Insert Function\" dialog box encountered when selecting a function. All our uses of MATCH use a match type of 0 (zero). There are two other match types: −1 and +1. Note what each match type gives you.\nIronwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. - Ironwood Presents New Data Demonstrating Potential of IW-3300 for Visceral Pain at Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) 2022\n– Other Studies Highlight Impact of Linaclotide in Adult and Pediatric Populations, Highlight Disease Burden –\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: IRWD), a GI-focused healthcare company, presented new findings during the 2022 Digestive Disease Week® (DDW) meeting that suggest colonic IW-3300 has the potential to help manage abdominopelvic visceral pain in patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) and related visceral pain disorders. The oral presentation, titled Colon-Targeted Delivery Of Guanylate Cyclase-C Agonist IW-3300 Relieves Comorbid Chronic Pelvic And Somatic Pain In A Rat Model Of Early Life Stress-Induced Colonic Hypersensitivity (presentation number 240), provided evidence that delivery of IW-3300 to the colorectal region inhibits overlapping chronic pelvic pain in an established preclinical model of early-life stress induced colonic hypersensitivity.\nA poster titledSafety and Efficacy of Linaclotide in Children Aged 2-5 years With Functional Constipation; Results From a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multidose Study (presentation number Tu1390), presented by Carlo Di Lorenzo, M.D., Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, showed that linaclotide 9 mcg, 18 mcg, 36 mcg and 72 mcg were well tolerated in children aged 2–5 years with functional constipation. The findings were consistent with safety profiles from a previous pediatric linaclotide study in children with FC aged 6–17 years. In this small population, numerically better efficacy results were observed in the LIN 72 mcg dose groups vs. placebo for three of the four key efficacy endpoints, with stool consistency showing a dose-response trend. The authors note that the efficacy and safety of LIN need to be further characterized in a larger study of longer duration.\nLinaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) agonist that is thought to work in two ways based on nonclinical studies. Linaclotide binds to the GC-C receptor locally, within the intestinal epithelium. Activation of GC-C results in increased intestinal fluid secretion and accelerated transit and a decrease in the activity of pain-sensing nerves in the intestine. The clinical relevance of the effect on pain fibers, which is based on nonclinical studies, has not been established. In the United States, Ironwood and AbbVie co-develop and co-commercialize LINZESS® for the treatment of adults with IBS-C or CIC. In Europe, AbbVie markets linaclotide under the brand name CONSTELLA® for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe IBS-C. In Japan, Ironwood's partner Astellas markets linaclotide under the brand name LINZESS for the treatment of adults with IBS-C or chronic constipation. In China, (including Hong Kong and Macau) Ironwood's partner Astra Zeneca markets linaclotide under the brand name LINZESS for the treatment of adults with IBS-C. Ironwood is also partnered with AbbVie for development and commercialization of linaclotide in all other territories worldwide.

Perhaps even more surprisingly, 1,561 genes were also activated differently in the short-term practitioners relative to the controls.\nIt was observed that some of these gene changes seemed to cluster in genes linked to blood formation as well as genes linked to stress, oxidative metabolism, and primary metabolism, which the researchers suggest are “kind of a reversal of the genetic and cellular stress responses.”\n“this study provides the first compelling evidence that the relaxation response elicits specific gene expression changes in short-term and long-term practitioners.”\nFor decades now, clinical studies have been revealing the positive health effects of relaxation producing activities such as yoga, mediation, Qi Gong and Tai Chi. Dr. Herbert Benson of the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind/Body Medicine explains that the team is continuing to explore ways that\nDermalogica - Body Therapy Favorites Limited Edition Set\nHomeShop by BrandsDermalogicaSkincare KitsDescriptionSaving OffersGift With Purchase($29.50 Value) Get all-over skin health benefits with the Dermalogica Body Therapy Favorites Limited Edition Set.

        "description": "Naturopath Scottsdale | Natural Doctor | Alternative Candida Treatment | Naturopathic Medicine Blog Naturopath Scottsdale | Natural Doctor | Alternative Candida Treatment | Naturopathic Medicine Blog\nTreatment of Candida by Naturopathic Doctor in Scottsdale\nNaturopathic Remedies for Candida\nIf you think you suffer from Candida or even wonder if Candida might be the cause of other health issues you deal with, consider searching out the services of a naturopathic doctor Scottsdale clinic. A naturopathic doctor Scottsdale clinic can help you determine if Candida is at the root of your problem, and if so, instruct you on some naturopathic remedies for dealing with Candida.\nFirst of all, what is Candida? Put simply, Candida is a yeast, also known as a fungus, that some people produce an excess amount of in their bodies. Candida can cause a number of health-related issues among otherwise healthy individuals. People with Candida experience a vast array of symptoms, some of which are the same, and some of which differ. Physical indications of Candida can exhibit themselves as flu-like symptoms, irritable rashes, itching, oral blisters, a sore throat, and a coating of white on the tongue. For some people, the physical symptoms are the worst, however, for others, the psychological problems are most devastating. Psychological indications of Candida could include fatigue, difficulty concentrating and remembering things (also referred to as brain fog), depression, irritability, anxiety, mood swings, and paranoia. Sometimes people with Candida will find that they are unable to get a good night's rest; that their weight fluctuates without a change in their diet; that they have allergies and sensitivities to foods and odors; that they have irregular menstrual cycles; and that they have skin conditions such as acne, eczema, and dermatitis. If any you have exhibited these symptoms, perhaps a naturopathic doctor Scottsdale clinic could help you find solutions to battling Candida.\nWhy should you use a naturopathic doctor Scottsdale clinic for treating Candida? One of the best reasons to use a naturopathic doctor is that they will provide natural remedies and solutions for combating Candida. This is beneficial because instead of loading your body up with medication that could cause other side affects and problems, you will be facing the issue head-on and dealing with these issues naturally, which is best for your body. Some people are skeptical that a naturopathic doctor can help fight Candida effectively. However, you will probably find that naturopathic doctors offer the most sound advice for dealing with Candida. Many of their solutions focus on making your body healthier and preventing infections from occurring in the first place.\nIf you have dealt with Candida, you have probably wondered how you can prevent Candida symptoms from happening again. Fortunately, there are a few solutions to preventing Candida infections. The most common method for battling Candida is the Candida diet. This diet identifies foods you should avoid, as well as foods you should consume. You may have noticed that certain foods have provoked an infection in your body. The Candida diet recommends that you avoid sugars (including fruit), alcohol, starchy vegetables, pork, fish, cured and processed meats, nuts, beans, mushrooms, vinegars, certain condiments, fats and oils, and additives and preservatives. Though this may seem like a long list of things to avoid, there are many more things you can eat while on the Candida diet. Talk to a naturopathic doctor Scottsdale clinic about which foods are included in the Candida diet. Though you will want to avoid some things, you will find other preferable substitutes. Also, the benefits of avoiding certain foods far outweigh the inconvenience, as you will feel better and as Candida infections and symptoms are less likely to occur.\nRED LIGHT THERAPY WRAPS - Naturally Animals - Natural Herbs For Animals\nRED LIGHT THERAPY WRAPS - Naturally Animals Products Shop\nTop Level > RED LIGHT THERAPY WRAPS\nWE ARE DELIGHTED TO BE UK DISTRIBUTORS FOR THE RED LIGHT THERAPT WRAPS.

It is recommended that 10 to 15 minutes be used when the Therapy Wrap is around a limb.\nWhen the Wrap is being used flat then up to 20 to 30 minutes per area is sufficient.\nUp to 3 applications can be made over a 24 hour period if necessary.\nBest benefits will achieved when the Therapy Wrap is used on a regular basis.\nEQUINE USES:\nCANINE USES:\nThe Therapy Wrap is an ideal way to help dogs suffering from arthritic conditions in the spine, sacroiliac joints and hips.\nRacing Greyhounds:\nThe Therapy Wrap offers much in the way of stimulating circulation as a pre-race warm up. It is also desirable as a post-race recovery treatment.\nDogs only need a short application time due to their size. It is recommended that 3 to 5 minutes is sufficient for one session. Sessions can be repeated 2 to 3 times a day.\nNo harm can be done if the Therapy Pad is left on for longer periods of time. The body will only absorb what it needs in any one session.\nUse the pad as often as required.\nAs first aid: For best results on an acute injury (first 24 hours) use ice for 10 to 20 minutes then the Therapy Pad. Both can be used alternatively until the initial inflammatory response has subsided. After this period the Therapy Pad can be used on its own.\nAs a safety precaution it is recommended NOT to use the Therapy Wrap if your animal is pregnant, taking thyroid medication, or if diagnosed with cancer.\nHOW DOES LED THERAPY WORK?\nNumerous studies have concluded the following effects of LED Therapy.\nLED's at specific wavelengths are reported to increase circulation by increasing the formation of new capillaries.\nThis allows more blood supply – hence more oxygen and vital nutrients to reach tissues.\nThis increased circulation also allows for the faster removal of metabolic wastes.\nStudies site that LED Therapy stimulates the production of collagen. Collagen is an essential protein for repair to damaged tissue, including ageing skin and scars.\nLED Therapy reportedly stimulates the release of ATP – Adenosine triphosphate. ATP is the major carrier of energy to all cells.Increases in cellular ATP levels allow the cells to function more effectively and get rid of wastes faster.\nLED Therapy increases the activity of the lymphatic system thus promoting a faster elimination of swelling – oedema in tissues.\nLED Therapy reduces the excitability of nervous tissue by stimulating the release of endorphins. Endorphins are the body's natural pain fighting chemicals.\nLED Therapy increases the synthesis of RNA and DNA. This helps damaged cells to be replaced more quickly.\nLED Therapy increases phagocytic activity hence helps fight infections. Phagocytes help to destroy and mop up dead or degenerated cells.\nThe changing faces of diabetes hypertension and arthritis in a caribbean population, hospital medication errors, 200 s los robles pasadena ca, type 2 diabetes symptoms pregnancy mimic\nHospital medication errors,is type 1 or 2 diabetes genetic factors,abbott freestyle driver xp - PDF Books\nADHD is a chronic disorder. However, as kids get older, they learn various strategies to deal with the symptoms and may no longer need medication. Every drug has potential side effects, and these should be discussed with your child's physician.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics clinical guidelines recommend that symptoms of ADHD generally be treated for children 6 years of age and older. We have created this blog as a way to communicate key childrens' health and safety issues to parents and other child advocates. Since it happened on a Saturday night, when A and E departments are busy and ambulances are in full swing, it was thought it might be best to transport the patient to the nearest A and E department by car since there may have been a delay before an ambulance arrived.\nFirstly someone who seemed to be a lay person answered the phone and asked several questions very politely and calmly – all of them were relevant.\nThere was no doubt she was following a protocol on a computer screen in front of her and this clearly informed her that she would need to pass on the problem and in due course a nurse would phone back.\nThe ambulance arrived quickly and with flashing lights transported the patient to A and E where she was seen immediately. The problem with all of this, is that although the various team members involved all worked as the system decreed they should in an emergency, not one of them was trained in diagnostic skills. A new study revealed that a new HIV drug can prevent the virus from maturing by not allowing it to be cut from its building blocks.\nA new study by the collaboration of European Molecular Biology Laboratory and Heidelberg University Hospital revealed a detailed analysis of an immature form of HIV cells and how a new HIV drug prevents the virus from maturing. The study, published in the journal Science, showed that a newly developed HIV drug could prevent the maturity of HIV cells by locking them in place.\nHowever, HIV with certain mutations developed resistant against the new drug making them unaffected. The researchers found out that the virus became resistant to the new drug not by preventing or blocking its effects, but by circumventing them. With the use of the combined cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging, the researchers can study the structures of irregular virus like HIV in their real state.\nThis raises many questions that parents should consider before placing their children on medication to treat a disorder that affects 8 percent to 11 percent of our youth.\nIn fact, effective treatment for ADHD decreases the likelihood of substance abuse problems. In addition, the researchers in the Pediatrics article reported that \"misuse and diversion of stimulant medications are more widespread problems than abuse or addiction.\" In one study, between 16% and 23% of youngsters were asked to give or sell their stimulant medication to others.\nIt's critical that you work with a professional who has specialized training and experience. Although some emergency treatment for what turned out to be an accurate diagnosis was given at home it was clear the patient would need hospital admission for stabilisation and further investigation.\nVery politely, reassuringly, and calmly she asked another battery of questions that delved deeper into the problem. Further investigations were performed, she was kept in the acute medical receiving ward overnight and transferred to another medical ward the next day to be discharged stabilised a few days later. And so it took four hours for a patient who had collapsed semi-comatose with multiple serious pathologies and therefore various possible diagnostic problems to see a doctor. For this cell to mature, it needed to cut the connections between its main building blocks, known as the capsid protein and the spacer peptide 1, and rearrange those pieces.\nIn order to understand the effects of those mutations, the researchers used a combination of cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging to reveal exactly what this part of the immature form of HIV looks like in 3D. This method of observing the state of the virus and how certain drugs affects their structure can be used in the future development of new drugs to cure the dreaded disease. The latter typically involves both parental counseling and working with the child to learn organizational skills and self-control strategies. Adolescents on psychoactive medication have to be carefully monitored to minimize the likelihood of medication misuse. The Centers for Disease Control reported that more than 10,000 toddlers are prescribed stimulants for ADHD.\nWhile many physicians and child psychologists are quite skilled in treating this disorder, some are not. Ask lots of questions and don't be reluctant to seek a second opinion. However, it was found to be impossible to get the patient out of the house into the car without help and so a decision was made to contact the 24 hour NHS UK telephone service.\nSome experts also speculate that children with ADHD may be \"biologically more vulnerable\" to addiction problems due to the possible similar brain chemistry of these disorders. This was an error, the intention was really to dial 999 in spite of possible Saturday night ambulance delay.\nWhat can a diabetic eat to feel full movie\nFree diabetes pendant necklace\nGc homeownership\nAtkins Diet uses a series of phases either gaining muscle, retaining longer ones.\nAble to move out of the blood and into and embrace whole.\nJan martens openingsuren The diabetes miracle cure free download video Best herbal medicine for diabetic Janata bank Diet reverse type 2 diabetes quiz Traitement naturel contre le diab?te de type 2 pdf Type 2 diabetes natural supplements S works tarmac sagan Jan 2011 unit 4 biology mark scheme How do you know the difference between type1 and type 2 diabetes Treatment of diabetes in liver cirrhosis diet Gls 192 Gert jan segers biografie Metabolic surgery for type 2 diabetes ppt slides Treatment for high sugar diabetes diet Can a diabetic person drink orange juice Glarab pour windows 7 Natural healing for diabetic ulcers causes\nAzathioprine Safety, Efficacy in AAV Patients Not Affected by TPMT Protein\nCompared to patients with inflammatory bowel disorders, the safety and efficacy of azathioprine treatment in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) patients is not affected by lower TPMT protein activity, researchers found.\nThe study, \"Thiopurine methyltransferase genotype and activity cannot predict outcomes of azathioprine maintenance therapy for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody associated vasculitis: A retrospective cohort study,\" was published in Plos One.\nAzathioprine is an immunosuppressive drug widely used in autoimmune disorders to lower the activity level of the immune system. Its action depends on several metabolic reactions that break azathioprine into 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGN).\nBut while 6-TGN is responsible for azathioprine's immunosuppressive effects, it also causes severe toxicity, reducing the amount of white blood cells and putting patients at risk for infections.\nThe TMPT (thiopurine methyltransferase) enzyme works to reduce the amount of 6-TGN formed. But some patients have variants of the TMPT gene that cause the enzyme to have lower activity. In several patient populations, mainly in inflammatory bowel diseases, lower TMPT has been linked to a higher azathioprine-related toxicity to the bone marrow.\nThis raised the hypothesis that patients with autoimmune disorders could benefit from tailored azathioprine treatment based on their TPMT levels and activity.\nResearchers at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands investigated the impact of TPMT activity in patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV).\nThe study included 207 patients, diagnosed with either granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), or renal limited vasculitis (RLV), between 1984 and 2013. All participants had received azathioprine as maintenance therapy after achieving remission with cyclophosphamide and prednisolone.\nResearchers examined patients for variants of the TPMT gene and found that only 19 patients had TPMT gene variants associated with decreased enzyme activity. In these patients, TPMT enzyme activity was nearly twice as low as normal TPMT.\nBut over five years of follow-up, patients with TPMT variants had similar relapse rates compared to those with the normal gene version – 32% vs. 45%. There was a trend for higher enzyme activity to be correlated with higher rates of disease relapse, although this was not statistically significant. Both genetics and enzyme activity did not contribute significantly to the risk of disease relapse, researchers said.\nDuring the duration of the study, 16% of patients were intolerant to azathioprine, 8% had gastrointestinal complaints, 8% had a febrile hypersensitivity reaction, and 1% had a rash. None of these adverse effects were associated with TPMT genetics or enzyme activity.\nAlso, no correlation was found between TPMT and lower levels of white blood cells or liver toxicity.\nThe effect of cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) was shown to have a significant impact on patients' response to azathioprine. Patients with higher white blood cell counts at the time of the treatment switch were 17% more likely to relapse during azathioprine therapy.\nThese findings suggest that TPMT genetics or activity cannot predict relapse of frequency and severity of adverse effects related to azathioprine maintenance therapy.\n\"Leukocyte counts after cyclophosphamide induction were related to both outcomes, implying a greater influence\" of this therapy rather than azathioprine or TPMT in these AAV patients, researchers wrote. Additional studies are needed to confirm these new findings.\nadverse side effects, Azathioprine, outcome, relapses, toxicity, TPMT, treatment, treatment efficacy\nAn academic medical system working to keep people OUT of the hospital!

We examine the collaboration patterns of faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, through their academic output (papers and patents), and their organizational structures (institutional affiliation and spatial configuration) over a 10-year time span. An initial comparison of output types reveals: 1. diverging trends in the composition of collaborative teams over time (size, faculty versus non-faculty, etc.); and 2. substantively different patterns of cross-building and cross-disciplinary collaboration. We then construct a multi-layered network of authors, and find two significant features of collaboration on campus: 1. a network topology and community structure that reveals spatial versus institutional collaboration bias; and 2. a persistent relationship between proximity and collaboration, well fit with an exponential decay model. This relationship is consistent for both papers and patents, and present also in exclusively cross-disciplinary work. These insights contribute an architectural dimension to the field of scientometrics, and take a first step toward empirical space-planning policy that supports collaboration within institutions.\nCitation: Claudel M, Massaro E, Santi P, Murray F, Ratti C (2017) An exploration of collaborative scientific production at MIT through spatial organization and institutional affiliation.

However, the present system has been criticised and accused of bias, lack of transparency, failure to detect significant breakthrough and error. At the British Journal of Surgery (BJS), after surveying authors' and reviewers' opinions on peer review, we piloted an open online forum with the aim of improving the peer review process.\nIn December 2014, a web-based survey assessing attitudes towards open online review was sent to reviewers with a BJS account in Scholar One. From April to June 2015, authors were invited to allow their manuscripts to undergo online peer review in addition to the standard peer review process. The quality of each review was evaluated by editors and editorial assistants using a validated instrument based on a Likert scale.\nThe survey was sent to 6635 reviewers. In all, 1454 (21.9%) responded. Support for online peer review was strong, with only 10% stating that they would not subject their manuscripts to online peer review. The most prevalent concern was about intellectual property, being highlighted in 118 of 284 comments (41.5%). Out of 265 eligible manuscripts, 110 were included in the online peer review trial. Around 7000 potential reviewers were invited to review each manuscript. In all, 44 of 110 manuscripts (40%) received 100 reviews from 59 reviewers, alongside 115 conventional reviews. The quality of the open forum reviews was lower than for conventional reviews (2.13 (± 0.75) versus 2.84 (± 0.71), P<0.001).\nOpen online peer review is feasible in this setting, but it attracts few reviews, of lower quality than conventional peer reviews.\nCitation: Almquist M, von Allmen RS, Carradice D, Oosterling SJ, McFarlane K, Wijnhoven B (2017) A prospective study on an innovative online forum for peer reviewing of surgical science.

To highlight and share small pieces of information with possibly vast audiences or small circles of the interested has some value in almost any aspect of social life. But what is the value exactly for a scientific field? We perform a comprehensive study of computer scientists using Twitter and their tweeting behavior concerning the sharing of web links. Discerning the domains, hosts and individual web pages being tweeted and the differences between computer scientists and a Twitter sample enables us to look in depth at the Twitter-based information sharing practices of a scientific community. Additionally, we aim at providing a deeper understanding of the role and impact of altmetrics in computer science and give a glance at the publications mentioned on Twitter that are most relevant for the computer science community. Our results show a link sharing culture that concentrates more heavily on public and professional quality information than the Twitter sample does. The results also show a broad variety in linked sources and especially in linked publications with some publications clearly related to community-specific interests of computer scientists, while others with a strong relation to attention mechanisms in social media. This refers to the observation that Twitter is a hybrid form of social media between an information service and a social network service. Overall the computer scientists' style of usage seems to be more on the information-oriented side and to some degree also on professional usage. Therefore, altmetrics are of considerable use in analyzing computer science.\nCitation: Schmitt M, Jäschke R. (2017). What do computer scientists tweet?

A new ponder lends credibility to that link, and recommends that chemicals, such as sulfite preservatives in wine, may be the cause of these attacks.\nOf all the alcoholic drinks included in the ponder, \"wines were clearly the major guilty parties,\" says Hassan Vally, BSc (Hons), author of the ponder within the March issue of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Vally could be a researcher with the division of pharmaceutical at the University of Western Australia and the Asthma and Sensitivity Inquire about Founded in Western Australia.\nThe premise for Vally's study was a questionnaire sent to members of the Asthma Establishment of Western Australia. More than 350 individuals were included within the ponder, ranging in age from 18 to 83 years, with an normal age of 48.\nThey were inquired when their asthma was analyzed, how serious it was, what regularly activated attacks, and what asthma medicines they were taking. They were also questioned around whether they had ever had an unfavorably susceptible, allergic-like, or asthmatic reaction to any alcoholic drinks. Particular drinks were listed: red and white wine, champagne, fortified wines (such as sherry and harbour), beer, and spirits (like brandy, whisky and vodka). A checklist of asthmatic side effects was too included.\nBy and large, 43% of the respondents detailed having unfavorably susceptible or allergic-like reactions to different alcoholic drinks. Thirty-three percent said liquor had brought on asthma symptoms, with 26% saying asthma was the most adverse indication they experienced after drinking.\nWines were the most frequent trigger, named by 38% of the respondents as causing allergic responses and by 30% as causing asthma symptoms, the responses showed.\nRed wine in specific was the greatest culprit, causing allergic responses in 30% and asthmatic responses in 24%. White wine caused allergy flare-ups in 26%, and asthma symptoms in 22%.\nAsthma attacks triggered by drinking alcohol allegedly came on rapidly (in less than an hour) and were of moderate seriousness. Women detailed the most asthmatic reactions, as did individuals taking oral steroids, those who were youthful when they had their to begin with asthma attack, and those who had gone by an alternative wellbeing specialist for asthma. In spite of the fact that the respondents reported various unfavorably susceptible side effects associated with alcoholic drinks — including coughing, tingling, facial swelling, stomach upset, and dermatitis — asthma was the adverse side effect most regularly reported.\n\"It's difficult to conclude too much from the ponder based on a questionnaire … since there are no objective information,\" says Benjamin Gaston, MD, who surveyed the study for WebMD. He is associate teacher of pharmaceutical in hypersensitivity, asthma, and immunology at the University of Virginia Wellbeing Framework in Charlotte. \"Having said all that, I think what they discover is true and valuable to know.\" He includes that asthma assaults and allergic responses due to alcohol likely occur more often than previously thought.\nThe analysts note that, although assaults activated by alcoholic beverages are usually not severe, their think about appears that asthmatics should be cautious approximately drinking.\n\"There's a need for expanded awareness … of the potential for these drinks to trigger asthma,\" they write.\nI've always been exposed to the practice of obtainng product samples from beginning, middle, and end; or beginning, every 20th product, and end.\nIs there a specific requirement with BRC in terms of sampling? Or any sampling guideline we can use as a reference?\nMy current company's protocol is to sample beginning, and then 2 hours later (even thoug it may be a 10 hour run). I feel that it is not a representative of the entire lot of products. However, if we take more samples, yes we can a better representation of the run, but we will get into issues such as more product wasted (for sampling), delayed testing (as we need to wait until end of the run), and delayed product release.\nI'm sure other people can give more comprehensive answers to this than me (our products are fairly low risk), but essentially the overiding principle in BRC Food v6 is that product inspection should be done according to (food safety) risk.\nIn other words, the standard is fairly open-ended as to what you should do, as long as you can back it up and you review/feedback test records.\nMaybe if you are looking for specific reference(s) you should describe what kind of thing your company makes?\nAs previous post I think the simple answer is No for the 3 standards you mention. it may depend on product/process/target/tolerance/history etc. BAM give a salmonella sampling procedure for batches. i anticipate Health Canada do also.\nIf you are currently using the OP procedure I have some sympathy for yr laboratory staff.

Saudi J Oral Sci [serial online] 2016 [cited 2020 Jun 2 ];3:3-11\nAvailable from: http://www.saudijos.org/text.asp?2016/3/1/3/174289\nMedical emergencies (MEs) are identified as being unexpected onsets of serious health problems that may threaten a person's life. MEs occasionally occur during or after dental practice and most dentists may have experienced them at some point in their careers. [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9] The prevention and treatment of dental ailments, maintenance of masticatory functions, and improvement of cosmetic appearance are among the prominent goals in many dental practices. [1] Accomplishing these goals without difficulties associated with the MEs is considered to be the norm in quality dental practice. [2],[3],[4],[5]\nA survey of up to 2,704 dentists from North America, [2] founded that a total of 13,836 MEs had occurred within a 10-year period. However, none of these emergencies are actually truly dentally oriented but are potentially life-threatening medical problems that developed while the patients were in a dental clinic.\nOther surveys on the existence of MEs in dental clinics in the USA, [2] the UK, [3] New Zealand, [4] and Australia, [5] demonstrated that though rare, potentially life-threaten�ing situations do occur.\nA combined findings of surveys [2],[6] also showed 30,602 emergencies in the clinics of 4,309 dentists. More than 54% of these emergencies occurred during or right after local anesthesia. The greatest percentages of emergencies that were associated with potential high patient anxiety were tooth extraction and pulp extirpation. [2]\nIn Japan, a study was conducted by the Committee for the Prevention of Systematic Complications during dental treatment of the Japan Dental Society of Anesthesiology, under the auspices of the Japanese Dental Society. [7] The results showed that 19-44% of the dentists had a patient with a medical emergency in any one year. Approximately 90% of these complications were mild but 8% were considered to be serious. It was found that 35% of the patients were identified to have some underlying disease. Cardiovascular disease was found in 33% of those patients.\nAn additional factor that may lead to increased MEs in dental practice can be related to the increasing number of elderly patients who seek dental treatments such as bridge reconstruction, implants, and crowns. These patients are usually prone to many chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart problems, and others. Dentists who treat these patients may see an increase in the number of MEs. [8]\nMEs are most likely to occur during and after local anesthesia, primarily during tooth extraction and endodontic therapy. Over 60% of the emergencies were syncope, with hyperventilation being the next most frequent at 7%. [9]\nIn the United States and Canada, many studies concluded that syncope was the most common medical emergency faced by dentists. [10],[11] Syncope represented approximately 50% of all emergencies reported in one particular study, with the next most common event, allergic reactions representing only 8% of all emergencies. In addition to syncope, other emergencies that occurred were angina pectoris/myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, postural hypotension, seizures, bronchospasm, and diabetic emergencies.\nEffective management of an emergency situation in the dental office is ultimately the dentist's responsibility. [12] Unfortunately, many studies reported that dental students and even dental practitioners have little understanding on how to manage MEs, and there is very little in-depth data about the importance they place on this area that is fundamental to their professional training. [13] The lack of training and inability to cope with MEs can lead to tragic consequences and sometimes legal action. [14] For this reason, all health professionals including dentists must be well-prepared to attend to MEs. [5],[15],[16]\nAlthough education on MEs has been taught in most European [17],[18],[19] and American, [20] dental schools in recent times, little has been published about the self-perceived competence and confidence of dentists and dental undergraduates with regard to managing a medical emergency with basic life support (BLS) or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in dental practice. Only 30% of general dental practitioners in Great Britain consider themselves to be well-prepared to manage MEs at graduation [17] and more than half of New Zealand's dentists were dissatisfied with the training they had received for MEs as undergraduate students. [4] In fact, Kieser and Herbison reported that one of the greatest anxieties of dental students in general clinical situations was \"dealing with medical emergencies.\" [21] Another study, however, hypothesized that dental students' poor overall results in CPR skills could be associated with a low level of interest in that topic. [18]\nThe aim of this overview was, therefore, to provide basic background of knowledge and information for undergraduate/postgraduate dental students, dental practitioners, and hygienists in preventing, preparing, recognizing, and effectively managing MEs. The most frequently occurring dentistry MEs and their management were highlighted, together with the drugs that should be essentially available to the dentist to cope with such emergencies. Therefore, dentists must obtain as much information as possible about their patients' medical status before starting any dental intervention.\nLiterature Reviews Search Procedure\nThe search was electronically conducted through the EBSCO Searching Host from 2010 to 2015. A total of 1,142 articles were identified; however, only those items written in English were screened and included in the presented review. The key words and key phrases used were medical emergencies, medical emergencies in dentistry, medical emergencies dental, medical emergencies in dentistry diagnosis, and treatment.\nLiterature Review Search Outcome\nDental residents and assistants are supposed to deliver safe and pain-free dental procedures after graduation from dental schools. This not only includes competent dentistry skills but also the use of drugs such as opioids, ketamine, local anesthetics, and benzodiazepines for sedation and analgesic purposes. These drugs have inherent risks of cardiovascular and respiratory complications, which may be more evident with the current complexity of medical problems in patients at the extremes of age. [22],[23],[24],[25]\nThe extent of treatment by the dentist requires knowledge about the most prevalent MEs that he/she may face during dental practice and he/she should be aware of the medical and social events that may necessitate an alteration or modification of his/her treatment procedure for patient safety. Essentially, dentists are also required to be trained on the preparedness, prevention, and management of MEs crises when they occur. Background information is to be provided on the essential drugs needed to resolve such emergencies, together with understanding their actions, interaction, contraindication, dosage forms, and dose and method of administration. On the other hand, providing BLS and CPR training courses to the dentists will contribute most importantly as a first-aid emergency procedure until a definitive treatment for a medical emergency can be given.\n[2],[5],[9],[26],[27]\nDentists must be aware of the most common MEs that they might face during their treatment procedures. [Table 1] illustrates the most common medical crises in the dental office with a hint of their cause, the signs and symptoms, treatment precautions, and on how they can be resolved.{Table 1}\nChronic Medical Events, Which May Alter Dental Treatment\n[Table 1] is representative of chronically exiting medical events, which may alter dental treatment procedures as they could initiate unexpected serious health problems if not carefully monitored by the dentists. Preventing MEs permits the dental practitioner to conduct his/her planned dental treatment in an optimal environment by taking comprehensive information about the medical status of their patients before starting their treatment.\nPrevention is accomplished by conducting a thorough medical history with appropriate alterations to dental treatment as required. The most important aspect of nearly all MEs in the dental office is to prevent or correct insufficient oxygenation of the brain and heart. Therefore, management of all MEs should include ensuring that oxygenated blood is being delivered to these critical organs. This is consistent with basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation, with which the dentist must be competent. This provides the skills to manage most MEs, which begin with the assessment and if necessary the treatment of airway, breathing, and circulation (the ABCs of CPR). Usually, only after these ABCs are addressed, should the dentist consider the use of emergency drugs.\nUp to 90% of MEs can be avoided with proper prevention technique. The first step in prevention is to take affirmative answers to medical history questions by the dentist to explore comprehensive information about the health status of the patients. [29] These information are to be regularly updated and reviewed before each clinic visit. It may be essential in some cases to consult the patient's general physician for additional information and guidance.\nThe next step in prevention is to subject the patient to physical examination. Before beginning dental treatment, dentists have to take the baseline vital signs (including but not limited to blood pressure, pulse, and heart rhythm). [11] The dentist should also modify the dental procedure to decrease any potential risk to their patients. It is important to observe that excluding the procedures involving anesthesia, liability is more apt to occur for causing an emergency, i.e., if the dentist fails to take a thorough medical history or fails to follow procedures that might have prevented the emergency. [30]\nPreparedness and Management of Medical Emergencies\nDental practitioners cannot prevent every medical emergency; accordingly, they must be prepared to recognize and manage MEs when they exist. The American Dental Association (ADA) Council on Scientific Affairs [31] has set guidelines for preparedness, which include:\nCurrent BLS certification for all office staff.Didactic and clinical courses in emergency medicine.Periodic office emergency drills.\nTelephone numbers of appropriately trained health care providers.\nEmergency drug kit and equipment, and the knowledge to properly use all items.\nThe ADA mandates specific training and emergency drugs and equipment necessary for dentists who use conscious sedation, deep sedation, or general anesthesia. [32],[33],[34] The ADA \"Guide to Dental Therapeutics\" provides information for dentists who utilize the above sedation modalities. [35],[36]\nThe general dentist who does not use sedation or general anesthesia described above should follow the \"keep it simple\" principle. [37] The design of the emergency kit is dictated by the expertise of the dentist with various drugs and techniques, i.e., intravenous (IV) drug administration and endotracheal intubation. Dentists should not have drugs and equipment in the emergency kit that they do not know how to use or administer.\nAnother consideration is the location of the dental office. The dentist should determine in advance as to who would be called upon to help in an emergency and how long it would take for help to arrive. A dentist located in a rural area may have to wait for a considerable period of time for paramedics to arrive. In these situations, it is mandatorily for the dentist to become certified in Advanced BLS and design the emergency drug kit and equipment to fit his/her needs. [8] These dentists may want to include an automated external defibrillator (AED) in their office emergency equipment as part of the dentist's minimum standard of care. [38]\nPatient's Physical Evaluation\nThe basic physical evaluation of dental patients compromises four consequent steps.\nPatient's medical history questionnaire\nThis has to be completed by the patient and his/her guardian or parents. Computerized forms can be used to simplify the process. [38]\nDentist/patient medical history dialogue [39],[40]\nAfter reviewing the completed form, dentist may further asks the patient about any reported medical problem to determine the significance of the reported disorder to the proposed dental plan.\nPatient's physical examination\nThis includes visual inspection and monitoring the patient's baseline vital signs (e.g., temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure) that would provide valuable information about his/her cardiovascular system.\nAfter completion of the patient's medical history questionnaire and conducting the dentist/patient medical history dialogue and physical examination, the dentist has to assign his/her patient to a physical status category using the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA PS) classification system. [41],[42] This will help to predict any perioperative adverse reactions in patients receiving general anesthesia.[41],[42],[43] The ASA PS is used to study patients' risks and outcomes. [36],[44] The system consists of six classifications - PS 1 to PS 6 - that indicate the potential medical risks that can develop while the patient is under general anesthesia. McCarthy and Malamed adapted the ASA PS system for use in dentistry. A patient in the PS 1 category is defined as normal and healthy. He/she is an excellent candidate for elective surgical or dental care, with minimal risk of experiencing an adverse medical event during treatment. Patients in the PS 2 category have a mild systemic disease [42] or are healthy patients (PS 1) who demonstrated extreme anxiety toward dentistry or are above than 60 years. This category is generally able to tolerate less stress compared to PS 1 category patients, and the dentist should consider possible treatment modification for the PS 2 category patients. The PS 3 category patients have severe systemic disease that limits activity but is not incapacitating. [42] When [44] the patient is at rest, he/she does not show any signs and symptoms of distress (fatigue, chest pain, and shortness of breath); however, when stressed, he/she exhibits such sign and symptoms. The dentist should proceed with caution and give serious consideration on implementing treatment modification. The PS 4 category patient has an incapacitating systemic disease that threatens his/her life. [42] This category of patients has medical problems of greater significance than the planned dental treatment. Elective dental care with this category should be postponed until the patient's physical condition has improved to at least a PS 3 classification. Patients in the PS 5 category are almost always hospitalized and terminally ill. Elective dental treatment is contraindicated; however, emergency care in the realm of palliative treatment (relief of pain, infection, or both may be necessary. [42] The PS 6 category refers to brain-death patients whose organs are being removed for donor purposes. [42] The ASA PS classification is meant to function as a relative value system based on the dentist's clinical judgment and assessment of the available relevant clinical data. [43] If the dentist is unable to determine the clinical significance of one or more diseases, then he/she is recommended to consult the patient's physician or other medical or dental colleagues. The ultimate responsibility for the health and safety of a patient lies solely with the dentist who decides on whether to treat or not treat the patient.\nDental Staff Emergency Training\nEvery member of the dental team should have completed a basic first aid course and have annual training in CPR. [45] Retention studies have shown that if CPR skills are not used regularly, they are soon forgotten. A study on the perceptions of MEs among Brazilian dental students [13] indicated superficial knowledge of MEs that was derived from limited exposure in undergraduate classes, conferences, and the short preparatory course for acquiring a national driver's license. The students considered continual training in BLS to be necessary over their entire professional lives in order to control a medical emergency situation. The students demonstrated feelings of insecurity and responsibility since they would be the first on the scene of the emergency. In general, the dental students considered knowledge of medical emergency in the dental office to be essential for safe dentistry and believed that it must be more effectively taught in the undergraduate course. [13] The purpose of BLS is to prevent inadequate circulation or respiration through prompt recognition of the problem and intervention and/or early entry into the emergency medical service system as well as to support a victim's circulation and respiration through CPR. [13] However, a number of studies have found that about half the dentists from all over the world are not able to perform CPR properly. [5],[16],[18],[46] For this reason, medical emergency management training is gaining more importance for dental students. BLS is a core skill in which all health care professionals should be proficient but there is a great deal of variation in the training provided at the undergraduate level. [47]\nDrugs that should be promptly available to the dentist can be divided into two categories. The first category represents those which may be considered essential. The second category contains drugs, which are also very helpful and should be considered as part of the emergency kit.\n[Table 2] includes a list of the different category drugs including their indications and doses.{Table 2}\nBasic Emergency Drug Kit\n[31],[36],[48],[49],[50]\nThe availability of emergency drugs in dental office is mandated. It seems prudent to prepare an emergency drug kit. The ADA Council suggests the following seven drugs that include two injectable and five noninjectable drugs. [31],[36],[49]\nEpinephrine 1: 1000 and 1: 2000 (injectable).Histamine blocker (injectable).Oxygen with positive pressure administration capability.Nitroglycerin (sublingual tablet or aerosol spray).Bronchodilator (asthma inhaler).Sugar.Aspirin.\nEpinephrine represents the most important drug in the emergency kit, however it is probably the least likely to be used. Epinephrine is available and recommended as two Twinject ® (two-dose) preloaded syringes at concentration of 1: 1000 for adults and 1: 2000 for infants and chil�dren (between 1 year of age and the onset of puberty). The other injectable drug is a histamine-blocker, such as diphenhydramine 50 mg/mL. It is rec�ommended that the emergency kit contain two or three 1-mL ampules of diphenhydramine.\nBoth injectable drugs are used to manage the allergic reactions, whether life-threatening or nonlife-threatening (anaphylaxis).\nOxygen can be administered during almost any emergency situation and is available in an \"E\" cylinder, which provides O 2 for approximately 30 min during ventilation of an uncon�scious or apneic adult. Nitroglycerin is used as a vasodilator to control the acute angi�nal episode. Nitroglycerin is recommended in the spray form rather than the sublingual tablets. Albuterol is the preferred bronchodilator used to manage bronchospasm (acute asth�matic episode). An antihypoglycemic is a sugar source needed to manage hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), which is a common occurrence in dentistry. A tube of a glucose gel should be included in the emergency drug kit. Alternatively, 340 g of orange juice or soft drink (nondiet) can be used. Aspirin, either chewable or tablets, is recommended in the prehos�pital management of \"suspected myocardial infarction\" victims. A dose of 325 mg (one adult tablet) is chewed and then swallowed. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation, thus minimizing the size of the blood clot that develops during the \"heart attack.\" Dentists should continue to seek continual education to upgrade their knowledge and ability to safely and successfully employ emergency drugs.\nThe dentist also must have the knowledge to administer these drugs in the proper doses as treatment for specific emergencies. Package inserts and instructions should be read before an emergency when assembling a drug kit and reviewed periodically.\nDentists may choose to create their own emergency kit, placing drugs in drawers of small tool kits or clear bags labeled with the name of the drug, the condition it treats, instructions for administration, and contraindications for usage. He/she should keep the emergency kit in a cool, dry place and keep it up-to-date with currently needed drugs. A warning or notice of emergency drug expiration dates can be placed on the appointment book a few weeks prior to the actual expiry to allow the dental team time to replace soon-to-expire drugs.\nSimilarly, Malamed indicates that the \"five drugs that dentists are an absolute must have are: oxygen, a bronchodilator, a histamine blocker for anaphylaxis, nitroglycerin and epinephrine.\" [36],[49]\nOxygen delivery system including a positive pressure mask and/or a bag-valve-mask device with sev�eral sized face masks. Also recommended is a pocket mask to aid in mouth-to-mask ventilation. An AED is considered to be an absolutely essential part of emergency preparedness as early defibril�lation is the most important intervention in successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Other equipment include syringes and needles for drug administration, suc�tion and suction tips, tourniquets, and Magill intubation forceps (for easy retrieval of foreign objects from the posterior part of the oral cavity or the pharynx). [51] These items are described in [Table 3].{Table 3}\nMEs in the dental clinics frequently occur and may represent a possible serious threat to patients' health and could also hinder the delivery of the planned dental care procedure. It has been estimated that dentists may at least face one or two MEs during their lifetime practice. [1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10] Special consideration should be paid to elderly patients and individuals with history of underlying medical conditions as they could also initiate the possibility of increasing MEs.\nThe prevention of MEs is basically affirmed on acquiring the knowledge and understanding of the varieties of medical emergency crises that dentists may face during their practice. The dentists should also be prepared to prevent emergency crises by gathering information about their patients' preexisting medical conditions, knowing the drugs and medications that their patients might have taken, and their possible interaction with their dental procedure or the other drugs that they might be using. The dentist can obtain this information through assigned patient questionnaires, personal dialogue, and physical evaluation before the start of the treatment.\nThe patient's physical evaluation consists of four components including the patient's medical history questionnaires, dentist/patient history dialogue, physical examination (including monitoring and recording vital signs and visual examination), and assessment of risk.\nDentists should be well-prepared with the essential emergency drugs and equipment to be available in their clinics to resolve any existing crisis. The dentist should also be prepared and ready to prevent existing MEs. It is mandatory also for the dentists and the dental team to acquire both theoretical and practical training courses including BLS and the CPR skills.\nOn the other hand, many studies in the literature revealed that dental students are lacking the essential knowledge and training on how to manage MEs such that they perceive the need for more intensive education in MEs. [13] Dental schools are, therefore, responsible for implementing the knowledge and training for their students to be acquainted with the essential knowledge to resolve possibly encountered MEs. Standardized courses in MEs including BLS/CPR, together with the knowledge on the variety of MEs and the necessary procedure, emergency drugs, and equipment that are needed to resolve these crises should be taught during the course of the study to the undergraduates and as a continuing education courses for postgraduates, especially those who are attending master degree programs. Continuing education courses in MEs should also be demonstrated and attended by the dental assistants.\nFurthermore, dental students could routinely visit hospitals and emergency services to become familiar with the stress involved in a life-threatening situation. A 4-week hospital-based program for dental students had successful results in the evaluation and management of MEs. [52]\nThe authors would like to thank Riyadh Colleges of Dentistry and Pharmacy authority and their research center for the support and encouragement that made scientific research feasible for all staff and students. We also dedicate this overview to the undergraduate/graduate dentistry students and dental practitioners to provide basic knowledge and information that may increase awareness and enhance the preparedness to manage frequently occurring MEs in dental clinics.\n1 Reed KL.

        "description": "dermatologysterlingheight23397.blogzag.com\nDermatology, like the majority of clinical areas, is very specialized as well as has certain areas. It takes around 12 years of education, with the person first requiring to total medical college. After graduation, they enter a residency that can take 3 to 4 years to finish. When that is done, the private should after that obtain a certificate to practice as well as commonly becomes board licensed.\nDermatologists have the possibility to be general practitioners, or they can concentrate on clinical, medical, or cosmetic dermatology. Sometimes, a medical professional will practice all three of these fields. Below is a description of what each field of expertise entails.\nBeing a medical skin specialist suggests that the doctor's focus gets on making the individual better as well as healthier. They are trained to not only acknowledge conditions of the skin but also to understand whether other illness within the body are creating skin concerns. These professionals diagnose issues with the mouth, lips, skin, nails, as well as hair. The tools of the trade are commonly medications and also lotions.\nSurgical skin doctors concentrate on the medical side of the method. They are the ones that utilize anesthesia and reducing devices to remove cancer, tumors, or moles from the patient's skin. These specialists diagnose and deal with both medically necessary and also cosmetic concerns with the skin, mucous membranes, hair, and nails. They have the capability to help individuals with anti-aging treatments, skin grafts, and also skin cancer cells treatments.\nA cosmetic dermatologist, like a medical practitioner, is concentrated on a person's skin, hair, nails, mouth, and lips, yet rather than focusing on making the individual feel better, their emphasis is on making them look much better. They want their patients to be delighted and healthy, yet they likewise desire them to look their best. Generally, these doctors will get aesthetic training throughout their education in addition to clinical training. These specialists are the ones who administer Botox in Sterling Heights to do away with creases.\nThe devices of the sell the aesthetic area, again like the medical specialty, include creams and medicines. However, the majority of these experts can suggest non-prescription items that will certainly help a person instead of composing a prescription. They likewise have the ability read more to administer shots and also operate lasers to guarantee that the people that involve them leave their workplace looking their finest.\nA cosmetic skin doctor can have clinical and medical training, and all of these areas complement each other. The goal for medical professionals in this area is to diagnose skin disorders as well as treat them so that people feel and look far better. When seeking Botox in Sterling Heights, locate a doctor that is certified, expert, and also experienced to get the most effective care possible.\nKrogerus, Leena (63)\nKrogerus, L.

We have recently shown that rat CMV increases portal inflammation and bile duct destruction in a model of rat liver allograft rejection. Desferrioxamine (DFO), an iron chelator and antioxidant, has recently been demonstrated to have antiviral as well as immunomodulatory effects in vitro. We therefore investigated whether DFO inhibits (a) CMV infection and (b) graft destruction in our rat model. METHODS.: One day after liver transplantation, PVG (RT1) into BN(RT1), the rats were infected with rat CMV (RCMV, Maastricht strain; 10 plaque-forming units i.p.). The effects of 100 mg/kg body weight and 200 mg/kg body weight DFO were examined. RESULTS.: In the untreated group, the grafts were uniformly RCMV culture-positive. In the group receiving 200 mg/kg DFO, RCMV replication was effectively inhibited. Inflammatory response in the graft, and especially the number of macrophages, was significantly reduced by DFO. Portal inflammation and bile duct destruction were also significantly reduced. In the untreated group, the bile duct epithelial cells were found to be strongly positive for tumor necrosis factor-α and this expression was clearly decreased by DFO. In addition, DFO significantly inhibited vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression on sinusoidal endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS.: Our in vivo transplant study strongly supports the inhibitory effects of metal chelators on CMV infection and their possible usefulness in the treatment of CMV-induced pathogenic changes.\nKeywords: Adjuvants, Immunologic–Pharmacology ; Animals–Pharmacology ; Antiviral Agents–Metabolism ; Cell Adhesion Molecules–Physiology ; Cytomegalovirus–Immunology ; Cytomegalovirus Infections–Virology ; Deferoxamine–Pharmacology ; Graft Rejection–Complications ; Liver–Drug Effects ; Liver Transplantation–Immunology ; Nephritis–Pathology ; Rats–Virology ; Rats, Inbred Bn–Etiology ; Rats, Inbred Strains–Pathology ; Transplantation, Homologous–Metabolism ; Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha–Drug Effects ; Virus Replication–Drug Effects ; Adjuvants, Immunologic ; Antiviral Agents ; Cell Adhesion Molecules ; Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha ; Deferoxamine;\nE-ISSN: 15346080\nDOI: 10.1097/00007890-199912150-00020\nCell Block in Cytological Diagnostics: Review of Preparatory Techniques (2018)\nKrogerus, Leena ; Kholová, Ivana\nIn: Acta cytologica, 2018, Vol.62(4), pp.237-243\nDescription: The cell block (CB) technique refers to the processing of sediments, blood clots, or grossly visible tissue fragments from cytological specimens into paraffin blocks that can be cut and stained by the same methods used for histopathology. The technique brings additional tissue architectural information. CB can be used for ancillary techniques such as immunocytochemistry and molecular techniques. We reviewed the literature on the various preparatory techniques of CBs. There is a wide range of preparatory techniques for CBs and no golden standard for CBs exists: tens of methods are used in various institutions. The majority of the methods are modified in house techniques with a few commercially available kits. The techniques most commonly used are the plasma/thrombin method, the agar method, and commercially available Histogel- and Cellient CB-methods. Dissatisfaction with the cellular yield of the CBs is common. In the CBs, the cytological material is preserved for future use, which is a tremendous advantage in the era of targeted therapy and biobanking. The CB is thus central to the future of cytology: more can be done with less material and with less invasiveness to the patient.\nKeywords: Cell Block ; Cytology ; Cytology Technique ; Microtomy ; Paraffin Embedding ; Cytodiagnosis -- Methods ; Tissue Fixation -- Methods\nISSN: 00015547\nE-ISSN: 1938-2650\nDOI: 10.1159/000489769\nLong-term results of ablation with antireflux surgery for Barrett's esophagus: a clinical and molecular biologic study (2012)\nKauttu, Tuuli ; Räsänen, Jari ; Krogerus, Leena ; [et al.] Sihvo, Eero ; Puolakkainen, Pauli ; Salo, Jarmo A\nIn: Surgical endoscopy, July 2012, Vol.26(7), pp.1892-7\nDescription: The initial results from ablation therapy for metaplastic/dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (BE) are promising, but the results of extended follow-up evaluation are seldom reported. Neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser ablation and successful antireflux surgery for 18 patients with metaplastic BE primarily resulted in the total histologic eradication of BE in 15 patients (83%). After antireflux surgery, the healing of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) was objectively verified in all the patients. At late follow-up evaluation, endoscopy, conventional histology, molecular oxidative stress analyses in comparison with normal control conditions (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine [8-OHdG], superoxide dismutase [SOD], glutathione [GSH], myeloperoxydase [MP]), and immunohistochemistry (p53, and Cdx2, caudal-related homeobox gene 2, marking intestinal differentiation) of the neosquamous epithelium were performed. At the end of the follow-up period (range, 3-15 years; mean, 8 years), intestinal metaplasia without dysplasia was detected histologically in eight patients (44%). Six patients had macroscopic BE (mean length, 3.5 cm; range 1-10 cm). The neosquamous epithelium was histologically normal, with no underlying columnar tissue. The fundoplication was endoscopically normal in 14 patients (82%). The 8-OHdG level was higher in the neosquamous epithelium than in the control conditions in the distal esophagus (4.3 vs. 0.52; P = 0.0002) and the proximal esophagus (1.8 vs. 0.95; P = 0.006). Likewise, SOD activity was higher in the neosquamous epithelium (0.38 vs. 0.12; P = 0.0005), whereas MP activity and GSH levels remained normal. Three patients showed slight nuclear p53 expression (typical in normal inflammatory reactions), whereas Cdx2 positivity was confined to one case with recurrent intestinal metaplasia. The neosquamous mucosa, generated by the ablation of BE and the treatment of GERD with fundoplication, was stable during long-term follow-up evaluation in two-thirds of the patients with initial eradication. It had normal p53 expression and no Cdx2 protein expression. The oxidative stress of the neosquamous esophagus remained high, although the clinical significance of this is unclear.\nKeywords: Barrett Esophagus -- Surgery ; Laser Therapy -- Methods\nDOI: 10.1007/s00464-011-2121-3\nSupplementation of plant sterols and minerals benefits obese Zucker rats fed an atherogenic diet (2002)\nVaskonen, Timo ; Mervaala, Eero ; Krogerus, Leena ; [et al.] Karppanen, Heikki\nIn: The Journal of nutrition, February 2002, Vol.132(2), pp.231-7\nDescription: In most hypertensive rat models, serum total cholesterol is typically low and the cholesterol is primarily in the HDL rather than the LDL fraction. This difference from humans usually makes these animals unsuitable for experimental atherosclerosis studies. In the present study, we induced severe hypercholesterolemia including a 10-fold increase in serum LDL cholesterol, endothelial dysfunction and hypertension as well as vascular and renal damage in obese Zucker rats by feeding a human-type high fat, high cholesterol and high salt diet (butter 18, cholesterol 1 and NaCl 6 g/100 g dry weight). Supplementation of this atherogenic diet with plant sterols (1 g/100 g) and replacing the NaCl partially by calcium, magnesium and potassium effectively prevented the diet-induced increases in total and LDL cholesterols and 24-h systolic and mean blood pressures, and markedly improved endothelial function. Plant sterols and the minerals also protected against vascular and renal damage and extended the life span of the obese Zucker rats by 60% compared with the rats fed the atherogenic diet. Our findings suggest that human-type cardiovascular disorders can be induced in obese Zucker rats by feeding a human-type atherogenic diet. This seems to be a suitable animal model for experimental studies on atherosclerosis and hypertension as well as for evaluating new dietary approaches to reducing cardiovascular risk.\nKeywords: Arteriosclerosis -- Diet Therapy ; Cholesterol -- Blood ; Hypertension -- Diet Therapy ; Minerals -- Therapeutic Use ; Obesity -- Diet Therapy ; Phytosterols -- Therapeutic Use\nE-ISSN: 15416100\nDOI: 10.1093/jn/132.2.231\nMotion restriction and axillary web syndrome after sentinel node biopsy and axillary clearance in breast cancer (2003)\nLeidenius, Marjut ; Leppänen, Esa ; Krogerus, Leena ; [et al.] Von Smitten, Karl\nIn: The American Journal of Surgery, 2003, Vol.185(2), pp.127-130\nDescription: Background We evaluated the prevalence of motion restriction and axillary web syndrome (AWS) after sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and axillary clearance (AC) in a prospective study. AWS is a self-limiting cause of early postoperative morbidity after axillary surgery. Limited range of motion associated with palpable cords of tissue in the axilla are typical for AWS. Methods Altogether 85 breast cancer patients who underwent SNB only (49 patients) or SNB and AC (36 patients) were examined before and after surgery. The range of shoulder flexion and abduction and the presence of AWS were registered. Results The range of shoulder movements was restricted in 24 (45%) patients after SNB only and in 31 (86%) patients who also underwent AC ( P = 0.002). AWS was encountered in 10 (20%) patients with SNB and in 26 (72%) with AC ( P 〈0.00005). Conclusions In the SNB group, significantly less early postoperative morbidity was observed.\nKeywords: Axillary Clearance ; Axillary Web Syndrome ; Breast Cancer ; Postoperative Morbidity ; Sentinel Node Biopsy\nDOI: 10.1016/S0002-9610(02)01214-X\nCIP2A expression and prognostic role in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma (2013)\nRantanen, Tuomo ; Kauttu, Tuuli ; Åkerla, Jonne ; [et al.] Honkanen, Teemu ; Krogerus, Leena ; Salo, Jarmo ; Paavonen, Timo ; Oksala, Niku\nIn: Medical Oncology, 2013, Vol.30(3), pp.1-8\nDescription: CIP2A is overexpressed in many cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The regulation of c-MYC and CIP2A expression is characterized by a positive feedback mechanism facilitating the expression of both of them and accelerating cancer cell proliferation in gastric cancer. Increased CIP2A expression is a predictor of poor survival in some cancers. The incidence of positive CIP2A immunostaining and its association with c-MYC and its predictive value in esophageal adenocarcinoma are unknown. All esophageal adenocarcinoma patients from 1990 to 2007 with sufficient material for analysis of CIP2A and c-MYC in two university hospitals were included in the study. In addition, biopsies from Barrett's epithelium from the cancer patients and control tissue from normal esophageal mucosa adjacent to the tumor were included. CIP2A was moderately or strongly positive in 77.9 %, and c-MYC in 93.8 % of the cancer specimens. These frequencies were statistically different from the expression in normal esophageal epithelium. In addition, there was a positive correlation between CIP2A and c-MYC expression ( p = 0.018). According to adjusted Cox regression survival analysis, CIP2A and c-MYC had no effect on survival. However, among patients with stage IVA–IVB cancer, there was a trend toward poor prognosis in CIP2A-positive patients. The expression of CIP2A and c-MYC was associated with each other, and their overexpression was found in most cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, CIP2A and c-MYC had no effect on survival.\nKeywords: Esophageal adenocarcinoma ; Prognosis ; Survival ; CIP2A ; c-MYC\nDOI: 10.1007/s12032-013-0684-7\nA long-term clinical study on dislocated ankle fractures fixed with self-reinforced polylevolactide (SR-PLLA) implants (2002)\nVoutilainen, Nina H ; Hess, Michael W ; Toivonen, Terttu S ; [et al.] Krogerus, Leena A ; Partio, Esa K ; Pätiälä, Hannu V J\nIn: Journal of long-term effects of medical implants, 2002, Vol.12(1), pp.35-52\nDescription: Sixteen patients with dislocated ankle fractures fixed between 1988 and 1991 with self-reinforced poly(L-lactide; SR-PLLA) screws and/or rods were followed up after 8.6 to 11.7 years (mean 9.6 years) at the Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Helsinki University Central Hospital. In all patients accurate reduction of the fractures was retained and uneventful bony union was achieved. Good or excellent long-term functional results were observed in 15 out of 16 patients. One patient had post-traumatic osteoarthritis. In 5 patients, a late tissue reaction was observed over an extruding screw head with mild symptoms, which led to removal of small palpable masses. There were two superficial wound infections, one after a primary operation and one caused by a late tissue reaction after an operation. The correct operative technique, where all extruding extraosseous SR-PLLA material should be removed during the primary operation, should be followed.\nKeywords: Absorbable Implants ; Fracture Fixation ; Ankle Injuries -- Surgery ; Fractures, Bone -- Surgery\nISSN: 1050-6934\nDOI: 10.1615/JLongTermEffMedImplants.v12.i1.30\nReporting of thyroid fine needle samples is changing in Finland--the Bethesda system in thyroid cytology (2010)\nArola, Johanna ; Kholová, Ivana ; Timonen, Tuomo ; [et al.] Krogerus, Leena\nIn: Duodecim; laaketieteellinen aikakauskirja, 2010, Vol.126(20), pp.2449-53\nDescription: A recommendation for the reporting of thyroid cytological specimens was made as the consensus of the expert meeting arranged by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI). This Bethesda system will replace the former Papa classes also in thyroid cytology. The new Bethesda classification considers the representativeness of the thyroid specimen, and the classification is based on the correlation of the underlying histological change with the cytological report. In particular, follicular tumors and suspicion of them are separated from other tumors into their own group. The new system will bring about a significant improvement to the reports of thyroid cytological specimens.\nKeywords: Biopsy, Fine-Needle -- Standards ; Thyroid Neoplasms -- Classification\nScreening primary sclerosing cholangitis and biliary dysplasia with endoscopic retrograde cholangiography and brush cytology: risk factors for biliary neoplasia (2016)\nBoyd, Sonja ; Tenca, Andrea ; Jokelainen, Kalle ; [et al.] Mustonen, Harri ; Krogerus, Leena ; Arola, Johanna ; Färkkilä, Martti\nIn: Endoscopy, 2016, Vol.48(05)\nIn: Endoscopy, 2016, Vol.48(05), pp.432-439\nDescription: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is associated with increased risk of biliary dysplasia and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of early endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) with systematic brush cytology to identify risk factors associated with biliary neoplasia. Patients who were referred for their first ERC for suspicion of PSC between January 2006 and October 2011 were included in the study. Brush cytology specimens were scored as benign, suspicious, or malignant. End points were CCA, biliary dysplasia, benign histology, or benign disease course for ≥ 2 years. PSC was diagnosed in 261 patients (125 men, 136 women), most of whom were asymptomatic (n = 211). Cholangiographic changes were mild in 57.1 %. Men presented with advanced disease more often than women. Brush cytology was benign in 243, suspicious in 16, and malignant in 2 patients. Follow-up completed in 249 patients indicated a benign disease course in 232 patients. Seven patients were diagnosed with CCA and eight had biliary dysplasia in the explanted liver. Thus, 15 patients had biliary neoplasia, and suspicious or malignant brush cytology had been detected in 8 of them at initial brushing. Advanced extrahepatic cholangiographic changes with elevated aminotransferases at diagnosis seemed to be associated with increased risk of biliary neoplasia. Even in mostly asymptomatic patients with PSC, 42.9 % had advanced disease and 6.9 % presented with suspicious or malignant brush cytology at first ERC. Advanced extrahepatic ERC changes with elevated aminotransferases at diagnosis might be risk factors for biliary neoplasia.\nKeywords: Adult–Diagnosis ; Bile Duct Neoplasms–Epidemiology ; Bile Ducts–Etiology ; Cholangiocarcinoma–Pathology ; Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde–Pathology ; Cholangitis, Sclerosing–Diagnosis ; Cytodiagnosis–Epidemiology ; Diagnosis, Differential–Etiology ; Early Detection of Cancer–Pathology ; Female–Methods ; Finland–Complications ; Humans–Diagnosis ; Male–Epidemiology ; Middle Aged–Methods ; Retrospective Studies–Statistics & Numerical Data ; Risk Factors–Methods ; Transaminases–Epidemiology ; Transaminases–Analysis ; Transaminases;\nDOI: 10.1055/s-0041-110792\nBiliary dysplasia in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis: additional value of DNA ploidity (2012)\nHalme, Leena ; Arola, Johanna ; Numminen, Kirsti ; [et al.] Krogerus, Leena ; Mäkisalo, Heikki ; Färkkilä, Martti\nIn: Liver International, May 2012, Vol.32(5), pp.783-789\nDescription: BACKGROUNDDetection of biliary dysplasia in PSC is essential for proper timing of liver transplantation to prevent the development of cholangiocancer, which is considered a contraindication for liver transplantation in most centres. In patients with PSC, differential diagnosis of benign, premalignant and malignant biliary strictures is difficult. AIMSThis prospective study aimed to evaluate the role of DNA analysis in combination with brush cytology, scored ERCP findings, and tumour markers to detect hepatobiliary dysplasia and malignancy. MATERIAL AND METHODSBrush samples for cytology and for evaluation of DNA content analysed with flow cytometry came from 102 consecutive PSC patients referred for ERCP. Symptoms, serum Ca19-9 and CEA were determined at the time of index biliary examination. ERCP findings were scored for intra- and extrahepatic changes. The end-points were liver transplantation or diagnosis of malignancy or dysplasia. RESULTSMost of the patients were asymptomatic at the time of ERCP: 73% had no symptoms, and 12% had only mild symptoms. An aneuploid DNA content was evident in 20 (20%) patients, and cells suspected for malignancy in 22 (21%). Seven patients had both aneuploidity and cytology (7%) suspicious for malignancy. An end-point, diagnosis of malignancy or liver transplantation was achieved in 42 patients. Combining DNA ploidity and cytology in patients at the end-point, sensitivity was 72%, specificity 82%, positive predictive value 86% and negative predictive value 67%. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONIn this mostly asymptomatic PSC-patient population, 33% demonstrated abnormal brush cytology or aneuploidity. Determining DNA ploidy and brush cytology during ERCP offers a useful tool for identifying those PSC patients who are at high risk of developing cholangiocancer.\nKeywords: Brush Cytology ; Cholangiocancer ; Dna Content ; Flow Cytometry ; Hepatobiliary Malignancy\nDNI - Creative, a DNI company, Earns Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) VTrckS Contract\n405.526.1030\nDelaware Nation Industries\nHome\nAbout Us\nWho We Are\nLeadership\nServices\nLighting\nCabling\nConstruction\nNews\nCompanies\nCareers\nJob Search\nContact\nFacility Security\nHome\nNews\nLatest News\nCreative, a DNI company, Earns Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) VTrckS Contract\nDelaware Nation Industries\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma: April 4, 2022\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma (April 4, 2022) – Delaware Nation Industries (DNI) is proud to announce that Creative IT Solutions, LLC (Creative IT), an 8(a) certified subsidiary of DNI, was recently awarded a prime contract for the CDC’s Vaccine Tracking System (VTrckS) at the CDC Roybal Campus in Atlanta, Georgia, and other off-site locations.\nVTrckS, a critical component of the Vaccine Management Business Improvement Project (VMBIP), is a secure, web-based information technology system that integrates the entire publicly-funded vaccine supply chain from purchasing and ordering through distribution to participating state, local, and territorial health, and health care providers.\nVTrckS is integral to supporting current and future requirements for effectively managing and distributing publicly-funded vaccines.

In some cases, we recommend a course of therapy in addition to taking medication. If you are primarily interested in a psychiatric evaluation, we recommend that you come in for a triage assessment Monday - Friday between 9am - 4pm. The therapist on triage can advise whether the Counseling Center or an off-campus psychiatrist would be a better fit for your needs.\nPsychiatric providers at the Counseling Center do not prescribe stimulant medication. You can call us for a list of off-campus psychiatric provider or you can contact your insurance for names of providers in your plan.\nHow does the psychiatric provider decide what medication to prescribe for me?\nMedication decisions are made based on several criteria, including particular symptoms you are experiencing, other medications you are taking, medical problems you may have, and even information on how your family members have responded to medications. Your psychiatric provider will discuss medication options with you and answer any questions you may have.\nThe first-line treatment for anxiety is psychotherapy. Under certain circumstances, psychiatric providers at the Counseling Center may prescribe short-term courses of anxiolytic medication. The Counseling Center does not prescribe benzodiazepines on an ongoing basis.\nI'm running low on my medication and need to see a psychiatric provider, what should I do?\nOur strongest advice is to be proactive in term of your medical care and management of your prescriptions refills, and not wait to access medical care services at the last possible moment.\nIf you are not a client of the center, you may want to contact your prescribing provider and ask for a bridge prescription while you initiate services with a new provider or use the services of the nearest urgent care center. Additionally, you may use the Center's triage/brief assessment system to discuss your concern and explore potential options at the center.\nIf one of our psychiatric providers is currently seeing you, please call the Counseling Center and inform us of your current situation.\nFinally, due to demand issues, it may not always be possible for the Counseling Center to write an emergency prescription and we would advise you to visit your local emergency room or urgent care should the refill request be urgent.\nAcceptability of Sino-Implant (II) in Bangladesh: Final Report on a Prospective Study – Maternal Health Task Force\nThis report describes the results of a noncomparative prospective 12-month observational study that was conducted at 10 study sites in Bangladesh. The aim was to assess the acceptability and effectiveness of Sino-implant (II) among 595 women who had the device inserted in June and July 2011. The report presents data collected at baseline and at follow-up visits at three months, six months, and 12 months following insertion. Participants were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire, to evaluate insertion complications, method acceptability, pregnancy status, changes in menstruation, weight, or blood pressure, and any other side effects. Some data (e.g., weight and blood pressure) were gathered from participants' clinic records. Women who had the implant removed before 12 months were interviewed about the reasons for removal, their satisfaction with the removal, their health-seeking behavior and experiences, and any complications they experienced during or after removal.\nEpstein-Barr virus and associated head and neck manifestations Jain N, Bhatia V, Lattoo S - Ann Nigerian Med\nYear : 2011 | Volume : 5 | Issue : 2 | Page : 38-41\nNitul Jain1, Vishwas Bhatia2, Sohail Lattoo3\n1 Department of Oral Pathology, Eklavya Dental College and Hospital, Kotputli, Rajasthan, India\n2 Department of Prosthodontics and Implantology, Eklavya Dental College and Hospital, Kotputli, Rajasthan, India\n3 Department of Oral Pathology, Government Dental College and Hospital, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India\nDepartment of Oral Pathology, Eklavya Dental College and Hospital, Kotputli - 303 108, Rajasthan\nDOI: 10.4103/0331-3131.92947\nKeywords: Burkitt′s lymphoma, Epstein-Barr virus, Hodgkin′s disease, infectious mononucleosis, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, oral hairy leukoplakia\nJain N, Bhatia V, Lattoo S.

Anthony Epstein and Yvonne Barr, who discovered and documented the virus. The EBV, is also called human herpes virus 4 (HHV-4), is a virus of the herpes family. The virus consists of a linear double-stranded DNA core surrounded by a nucleocapsid and an envelope that contains glycoproteins. In addition, EBV has been defined as a category I human tumor virus by UICC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) in 1997. [1]\nMost people become infected with EBV and gain adaptive immunity. Approximately 95% of the world's population sustains an asymptomatic life-long EBV infection. EBV persists in the memory B-cell pool of normal healthy individuals and any disruption of this interaction results in virus-associated B-cell tumors. [2] Infants become susceptible to EBV as soon as maternal antibody protection disappears. Many children become infected with EBV, and these infections usually cause no symptoms or are indistinguishable from the other mild, brief illnesses of childhood. When infection with EBV occurs during adolescence or teenage years, it causes infectious mononucleosis (IM) 35% to 69% of the time. [3],[4] For this reason, EBV is best known for as the cause of IM. It is also associated with oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) and some particular forms of malignancy, especially Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and central nervous system lymphomas associated with HIV. [5],[6] Coincidentally many of the above mentioned diseases show their initial signs and symptoms particularly in head and neck area. Besides these, some investigators also have the evidence that infection with the virus is associated with a higher risk of certain autoimmune diseases, especially dermatomyositis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, and multiple sclerosis. [5],[7]\nInfectious mononucleosis (IM) (also known as EBV IM or glandular fever or Pfeiffer's disease or Filatov's disease and sometimes colloquially as the kissing disease from its oral transmission or simply as mono in North America and as glandular fever in other countries) is an infectious, widespread viral disease caused by the EBV.\nIM is an acute, self-limiting, non-neoplastic lymphoreticular proliferative disorder. [3] Although not classically defined as a sexually transmitted disease (STD), IM transmission occurs through intimate personal contact. IM is an infection that is caused, in at least 90% of cases, by the EBV. A similar condition can be caused by cytomegalovirus, but that one gives a negative on heterophile antibody test. [4],[5],[8]\nEBV infections occur worldwide. These infections are most common in early childhood, with a second peak during late adolescence. By adulthood, more than 90% of individuals have been infected and have antibodies to the virus. Most EBV infections in infants and young children are either asymptomatic or present as mild pharyngitis with or without tonsillitis. In contrast, up to 75% of infections in adolescents present as IM. [9] The incubation period for IM in young adults is 4-6 weeks. The diseases produce the classic clinical triad of fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. A prodrome of fatigue, malaise, and myalgia may last for 1-2 weeks before the onset of fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. [10] Fever in IM is generally considered to be rather high (38-39°C) and lasts 1-2 weeks; however, it may persist for more than 1 month. [9]\nLymphadenopathy and pharyngitis are most prominent during the first 2 weeks of the illness, while splenomegaly is more prominent during the second and third weeks. A morbilliform or papular rash, usually on the arms or trunk, develops in 5% of cases. [8] After the acute infection, the virus remains latent in B lymphocytes for the life of the host.\nThe diagnosis is made on the basis of symptoms and a laboratory profile characterized by peripheral lymphocytosis (e.g., 50% lymphocytes [primarily T lymphocytes]) and at least 10% atypical lymphocytes, along with a positive heterophile (Monospot) antibody test. [3],[4],[8]\nIn normal blood smears, large reactive lymphocytes represent about 1-2% of cells. In IM, they constitute 10-40% of circulating white blood cells. [3] Reactive lymphocytes are not EBV-infected B lymphocytes but are T lymphocytes that react to the infection. Heterophile antibodies are immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies that bind (agglutinate) to erythrocytes from non-human species such as sheep and horses. This process forms the basis for the Monospot rapid latex agglutination test. Symptomatic patients who have a negative heterophile antibody test should be retested in 7-10 days because this test can be insensitive during the first week. If the second test is negative, tests for viral capsid antigen (VCA)-IgG and VCA-IgM antibody and EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) should be performed. [3],[8]\nMost cases of IM are self-limited. As such, treatment of patients with IM remains symptomatic. The lack of efficacy of antiviral drugs results from the fact that mononucleosis is largely due to the immune response. Deaths are very rare and most often are due to central nervous system complications, splenic rupture, upper airway obstruction, or bacterial super-infection. Acute EBV infection has also been associated with cranial nerve palsies (especially those involving cranial nerve VII), Guillain-Barré syndrome, acute transverse myelitis, and peripheral neuritis. [8],[9]\nOral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) presents as vertical folded, hyperkeratotic white patches seen most commonly on lateral surfaces of the tongue, which can not be wiped off. It is associated with the presence of EBV particles in patients with chronic immunosuppression such as those having HIV infection. OHL may be seen in all phases of HIV infection, but most commonly seen in individuals with CD4 counts below 200 cells/ mm 3 . [11] In addition, it has been reported in patients who receive organ and bone marrow transplantation. Evidences of any premalignant potential or epithelial dysplasia has not been reported in OHL. Although OHL does not have malignant potential and does not require therapy, it is important to diagnose suspicious lesions accurately because it is an indicator of immunodeficiency EBV can infect oral epithelial cells, but it is not found in oral cancers. It is also important to note that presence of OHL has not been associated with person to person transmission of EBV as it is for IM. Because of its clinical appearance, differential diagnosis must include chronic hyperplastic candidiasis. However, to establish a definitive diagnosis of OHL, it is mandatory to verify presence of EBV in superficial layers of epithelium in the vacuolated cells often referred to as koilocytes (cells suggestive of viral infection). [12],[13],[14]\nThe World Health Organization defines Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) as \"A carcinoma arising in the nasopharyngeal mucosa that shows light microscopic or ultra-structural evidence of squamous differentiation.\"\nNPC is uncommon in the United States and in most other nations but is extremely common in southern regions of China, particularly in Guangdong accounting for 18% of all cancers in China. [15] It is sometimes referred to as Cantonese cancer because it occurs in about 25 cases per 100,000 people in this region, 25 times higher than the rest of the world. Although rare in Caucasian populations, NPC has endemic clusters in Alaskan Eskimos, Indians, and Aleuts.\nThere are three microscopic subtypes of NPC: a well-differentiated keratinizing type, a moderately differentiated nonkeratinizing type, and an undifferentiated type, which typically contains large numbers of non-neoplastic lymphocytes (chronic inflammatory cells), thus giving rise to the name lymphoepithelioma. The undifferentiated form is most common and is most strongly associated with EBV infection of the cancerous cells. [16],[17],[18],[19],[20]\nNPC is primarily a tumor of adults with a peak occurrence between 40 and 60 years, although the tumor can occur in children. There is a strong male predominance of about three times, irrespective of geographic location. Most tumors arise on the lateral wall of the nasopharynx, especially common in the fossa of Rosenmuller. Most tumors are exophytic (about 75%), with a few described as ulcerated (about 10%). Cervical lymph node metastasis is also common. Most patients present with an asymptomatic cervical lymphoadenopathy (typically in the apex of the posterior cervical triangle or in the superior jugular chain of nodes), serous otitis media, epistaxis, or nasal obstruction. A blood-tinged postnasal drip is also seen. [16],[17],[18]\nIn situ hybridization or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is generally needed to document the EBV. The EBV encoded early RNA (EBER) is the most sensitive and specific analysis available at present. Inactivation of the p16 tumor suppressor gene on 9p21 by homozygous deletion and methylation has been shown to be the most common molecular alteration in NPC tumorigenesis. Treatment requires radiation therapy and is increasingly combined with chemotherapy. [1]\nBurkitt's lymphoma (BL) is an unusual type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurring endemically in the narrow zone across central Africa, where malaria is endemic. [21],[22] This tumor was named after Denis Burkitt who first described cases of rapidly growing jaw and abdominal tumors late back in 1956. BL is the human cancer most closely linked with a virus known as EBV. The disease was first thought to be limited to African children, but subsequently it was reported in other parts of the world as well. [5],[6]\nAs of a study published in 2009, comprising 5-year retrospective review of pediatric solid tumors as seen at the Jos University Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, non-hodgkin's lymphoma and BL accounted for 17 (19.5%) and 12 (13.8%), respectively, of a total of 181 solid tumors of children. [23]\nIn an another study that analyzed the profile of cancers recorded in the first decade (1995-2004) of establishment of the Kano cancer registry (KCR), a histology/cytology-based registry in Kano, Nigeria, BL (31.4%), other lymphoreticular cancers (23.8%) and retinoblastoma (20%) predominated in children of a total of 1990 cancer cases. [24]\nEBV is associated with 90% of African patients with BL, but this incidence is significantly lower for BL seen in other parts of the world. In addition, high levels of antibodies to EBV are found in all African children with BL, but in only half of normal African children. [14] The reason for this association remains largely unknown. The virus may be a prime etiologic agent, a cocarcinogen, or just an innocent passenger. But it has been suggested that malaria infection in Africa may impair cellular immunity to EBV and induce polyclonal B-cell activation with an expansion of EBV-infected B cells. [9] These changes may enhance the proliferation of B cells, increasing the likelihood of a c-myc translocation-the hallmark of BL. This gene is found at 8q24. [21],[22],[25],[26],[27],[28]\nThe African form of BL manifests as rapidly growing extranodal jaw tumor in young children, but it also may be first detected as abdominal mass involving kidneys or ovaries. The tumor expands rapidly and may double in size every 1-3 days, making it the fastest growing human tumor. The primary tumor cell has been shown to be a poorly differentiated B lymphocyte.\nThe diagnosis is based on characteristic microscopic pattern of small noncleaved B-cell lymphoid proliferation in a \"Starry Sky\" pattern. The treatment consists of combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. [21],[22],[25],[26]\nHodgkin's disease (HD) is a lymphoma, with a characteristic bimodal age incidence. In about 60-80% of cases, HD appears to start in regional lymph nodes of head and neck region, giving the first signs of cervical lymphadenopathy with associated symptoms including fever, unexplained weight loss, excessive sweating pruritus, and fatigue. [2],[5],[6],[29],[30],[31] The diagnosis of HD is based on the histologic presence of multinucleated Reed-Sternberg giant cells. EBV has been associated with HD, especially the mixed cellularity type. [30] EBV antigens can be detected in tumors in up to 40% of all HL cases Patients with HD often have elevated titers of antibody to EBV. In about half of cases, viral DNA and antigens are found in Reed-Sternberg cells More Details. The risk of EBV-positive HD is significantly increased in young adults after EBV-seropositive IM. [30],[31],[32] About 50% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in patients with AIDS are EBV-positive. The treatment of disease consists of either chemotherapy or radiotherapy or a combination of both with the selection primarily dependent on staging of the disease.\nEBV is famous as the etiologic agent of acute IM but is also closely associated with the genesis of OHL, undifferentiated NPC, BL and HD. The relation of the virus to the malignancies varies from primary etiologic agent to necessary or contributory cofactor. The EBV-associated malignancies offer insights into the causation and early detection of cancer. Many of these diseases involve head and neck area, so the dentist and ENT surgeons should well know their clinical manifestations to make accurate diagnosis at the first stage.\n1.

It can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, and if it occurs, you must follow the advice of your care team. Your GP or diabetes team may advise you to closely monitor your blood sugar level or take additional tests for ketones, which are associated with diabetic ketoacidosis. You should also watch out for any additional symptoms, which could indicate more serious complications and need immediate hospital treatment.\nSymptoms of high blood sugar\nGestational diabetes is a potentially serious condition that increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy. A screening test for gestational diabetes is done during your first antenatal visit, typically around week eight or twelve. A glucose test takes about 2 hours, and it can determine whether you have gestational diabetes. A midwife can help you manage your condition by assessing your risk. You will likely have additional tests during pregnancy, including one for diabetes during pregnancy.\nDuring your pregnancy, your doctor will perform blood glucose tests several times a day. Your doctor will probably recommend that you fast for two or three hours between meals. Your doctor will likely prescribe medication or insulin injections if diet and exercise do not control your glucose level. In most cases, a woman's blood sugar levels will return to normal after delivery. But some women may not respond well to these changes and will require insulin.\nAlthough pregnancy-related blood sugars can vary, the best way to determine if you have gestational diabetes is to seek medical attention as soon as you notice a change in your glucose levels. If you have elevated blood sugars during pregnancy, it will translate to higher blood sugar levels in the baby's blood. High blood sugar levels can cause a number of complications in the fetus, including bigger babies at birth.\nIn addition to your doctor's recommendations for diet and exercise, you should also discuss your lifestyle with your provider. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables, three meals a day, two or three snacks, and moderate physical activities are good ways to lower your blood sugar and minimize your insulin needs. In addition to healthy eating and regular blood glucose testing, your doctor will monitor the growth of the baby and prescribe supplementary insulin for blood sugar management.\nOther symptoms of gestational diabetes include increased thirst and frequent bathroom visits. A high amount of thirst may go hand in hand with increased water intake. Increased thirst will cause you to feel thirsty without adding salt. You may also have a dry mouth, which will also increase your urge to drink water. Dry mouth can also be a sign of gestational diabetes. And you'll definitely want to discuss any weight gain you might be experiencing with your doctor.\nSymptoms of hyperglycemia\nThere are a variety of tests to diagnose gestational diabetes, including an oral glucose tolerance test. The test is given in a healthcare provider's office and involves the patient drinking a sweet liquid and fasting overnight. The healthcare provider will then measure blood-sugar levels two to three hours later. If the test results are abnormal, the woman will likely need to take insulin. If there is no other obvious cause, diabetes will be suspected.\nPreterm delivery is a possible complication of gestational diabetes, since large babies are difficult to deliver. The baby will be larger than the mother's usual weight, which can cause damage during birth or necessitate a C-section. Also, if a pregnant woman's blood glucose is too high, her baby may experience hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar. High blood sugar levels in the mother will cause the baby's pancreas to produce more insulin to deal with the high levels, so the baby will no longer have the maternal, high blood sugar.\nWomen who have high blood sugar levels during pregnancy may experience blurred vision. This is because the eyes are sensitive to blood-sugar levels, and a high level of sugar can interfere with eye function. Other symptoms of gestational diabetes include nausea, fatigue, lightheadedness, and general feelings of unwellness. Regardless of any symptoms, the best way to treat gestational diabetes is to have a blood glucose level checked by a healthcare professional. Early diagnosis and treatment can help control and limit the symptoms, and proper blood sugar management can ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby.\nType 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition and usually begins in adulthood. Young children and adolescents are also susceptible to developing this disease. If your family has a history of type 2 diabetes, it's important to visit your doctor for a diagnosis. Symptoms of gestational diabetes should be noticed as soon as possible, especially if you have any risk factors. The mother's health is at risk, and the baby's development is dependent on it.\nSymptoms of gestational diabetes\nA medical professional must diagnose gestational diabetes to determine whether the mother has the condition. The high blood sugar levels in the mother's blood translate to higher levels in the fetus' blood. High blood sugar levels in the fetus can cause a variety of problems, including larger babies at birth. These symptoms should prompt a visit to a doctor to determine the severity of the condition.\nOther common symptoms of gestational diabetes include a persistent thirst, even when a woman consumes sufficient amounts of fluid. Pregnant women may also experience a persistent sense of thirst, even after eating and exercising. Women may also experience extreme fatigue, even without exerting themselves physically. Similarly, the sensation of dry mouth may accompany an increase in thirst. Some women also experience headaches, fatigue, and frequent bathroom trips.\nAlthough gestational diabetes can't be prevented, the risk of developing it can be minimized by maintaining a healthy weight. Women who are overweight before conception should lose excess weight before becoming pregnant. However, weight gain during pregnancy should be in a healthy range. A doctor can help pregnant women monitor their weight and establish a diet plan that works well for them. If diet and exercise alone do not control gestational diabetes, supplemental insulin may be required.\nDuring pregnancy, women without a history of gestational diabetes will be offered screening for the condition. These screenings will assess blood glucose levels. If you have elevated blood glucose levels, a doctor may recommend a glucose tolerance test. A diabetic woman should avoid high-fat foods and limit alcohol intake during pregnancy. These precautions can help the woman avoid gestational diabetes, as well as its complications.\nIn addition to diet and exercise, women should try to get a regular exercise routine. The exercise can help the mother lose some of the pregnancy pounds. It's also important to get your BMI under control during pregnancy, since women with gestational diabetes are more likely to have type 2 diabetes after giving birth. To minimize the risk of gestational diabetes, it's important to maintain a healthy weight after pregnancy. Getting your BMI down to a healthy range during pregnancy can help you manage gestational diabetes in a natural and healthy way. It's best to consult a dietitian or nutritionist for help.\nDiabetes Information\ncoming soon..\nSearch\nRecent Posts\nDoes an i-Port Advance Cause Scarring?\nApples and Diabetes\nManna Blood Sugar Support\nOneTouch Verio Test Strips Review\nType 1 Diabetes and Insulin Resistance\nArchives\nDecember 2022\nNovember 2022\nOctober 2022\nSeptember 2022\nJune 2022\nMay 2022\nApril 2022\nCategories\nDiet & Nutrition\nFeatured\nGlucose Monitors\nHealth Resource\nMental Health\nSupplements\nTreatments\nRecent Post\nDoes an i-Port Advance Cause Scarring?\nDecember 4, 2022\n5 min read\nApples and Diabetes\nNovember 30, 2022\n8 min read\nManna Blood Sugar Support\nNovember 30, 2022\n5 min read\nStay In Touch\nAll Tags\na glucose meter AMP-activated protein kinase anti-diabetic Blood Sugar blood sugar levels Blood sugar support calibrate the meter Depression Development Diabetes Diabetes Medicine Diabetes Questions Diabetes Symptoms Diet Gastational Diabetes glucofort Glucometer Side Effects Gymnema Home Remedies hypoglycemic agents i-Port Advance i-Port Advance Cause Scarring Information insulin insulin injections Insulux It causes scarring mitochondrial complex I natural supplement pharmacies Pregnancy regulate hunger results Review safe to use scarring self-assess meter accuracy Self-Care Stress test strip The Contour Plus One Glucometer The Contour Plus One Glucometer Features The Contour Plus One Glucometer Price Type 1 Diabetes Type 2 Diabetes\nColonoscopy Perforation Infection - Doctor insights on HealthTap\nI it was a simple diagnostic study, and you feel fine, you can rest assured that your ok.

The First Lady's work will have an immensely positive effect on the nation's health and wellness.\nThe obesity campaign announced by the First Lady shows an understanding that municipal leaders need to play an important role in promoting nutrition and fitness in the nation's communities. It takes into account the need for a coordinated effort across agencies and across governments for there to be a meaningful impact on childhood obesity rates.\nNLC member cities acted as representatives for cities nationwide at the event. Participating were Mayor Joseph A. Curtatone of Somerville, Mass., and Mayor Chip Johnson of Hernando, Miss.\n\"The obesity epidemic is killing our children,\" said Mayor Chip Johnson.\"We are very happy that the First Lady understands the role of municipal government in combating childhood obesity.\"\nMore than 12 million children and adolescents are considered obese, putting these children at higher risk of developing serious health problems later in life. This increase in potential health problems may cost governments, businesses and families $117 billion per year in future health care costs, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\"We are extremely honored to stand beside the First Lady to continue our work to reduce the incidence of childhood obesity in America,\" said Mayor Curtatone.\"I am proud that local initiatives will serve as models of best practices for communities across the country. We look forward to continuing our efforts under the First Lady's national leadership.\"\nThrough its Institute for Youth, Education, and Families, (YEF Institute) NLC works to combat childhood obesity by raising awareness among municipal leaders about actions they can take to reverse the obesity epidemic. With support from Leadership for Healthy Communities, a national program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, NLC has created a network of municipal officials committed to reducing childhood obesity.\nThis Thursday, February 18, the YEF Institute will host a free, hour-long audioconference to share strategies that city officials can implement to encourage healthy eating behavior, increase access to healthy food and promote physical activity for children and youth. The call, titled \"Curbing Childhood Obesity: Lessons from the Six-City Community Wellness Project,\" will be held at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time. To register, visit www.nlc.org/iyef.\nNLC has also partnered with the American Association of School Administrators to provide technical assistance to municipal and school district officials in six cities to develop comprehensive community wellness strategies and policies. The YEF Institute's action kit for municipal leaders on Combating Childhood Obesity outlines a broad range of steps city leaders can take to promote healthy eating, access to healthy food and active living.\nFor more information on NLC's work on childhood obesity, visit http://www.nlc.org/IYEF/youthdevelopment/obesity/."

Please consult your medical provider for any treatment and diagnosis.\nSeasonal Affective Disorder is treatable. | Source\nChange Of Season Blues?\nHave you ever experienced a really bad case of \"The Blues?\"\nYou know ... that sad feeling that you can't quite put your finger on ... not exactly \"mourning-the-loss-of-a-loved-one kind of sad\" nor \"the kind of sad that borders on being suicidal\" but rather \"a winter doldrums, down in the dumps-type of depression.\"\nYou might have what is called Seasonal Affective Disorder - SAD. It usually occurs in wintertime when more time is spent indoors away from friends and it is a real medical condition.\nPeople with Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) usually dread the arrival of the fall and winter season each year which is why it is often called winter-onset SAD, winter blues or winter depression.\nPeople who experience Seasonal Affective Disorder report that their symptoms start around the same time each year and that it literally takes away all their energy, makes them moody and depressed, and causes them to hibernate. They literally pull in the carpet until spring and then return to society once spring has sprung.\nWhat if you are one of those people who lives in a place that is a year-round sunshine paradise, where harsh winter weather never rears its ugly head?\nAre those people so lucky that they never experience Seasonal Affective Disorder?\nThough it is mostly associated with winter, it can affect anyone during any season of the year in any part of the world.\nCharting Origin & Progression of SAD\nCharting SAD From European Journal of Psychiatry | Source\nPossible Reasons Why People Don't Look For Help\nWhy people don't seek help. | Source\nSeasonal Affective Disorder is a mood disorder coming under the psychological heading of Clinical Depression, some of which encompasses but is not limited to:\nPremenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PDD or PMDD)\nIn the extreme, periods of depression alternating with episodes of excessive energy and activity can meet the criteria for Bipolar Disorder, previously called manic-depressive illness, although it is the rare case when SAD would progress that far.\nHowever, if the patient already has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, then it is imperative that SAD therapy be considered as part of the treatment plan.\nThe research I've read says that the farther away you live from the equator, the more likely you are to experience SAD because of the shorter days and the lack of sunlight.\nBut lack of sunlight isn't the only factor disrupting the lives of people with Seasonal Affective Disorder.\nWith SAD, sleep patterns can be noticeably altered which affects moods. It also causes a drop in serotonin and melatonin levels which can lead to depression and lack of energy. It ravishes your appetite (sometimes for the better, but usually for the worse) and saps your energy.\nDisruptive sleep patterns aren't associated with just the change in seasons. People who work shift work or change their work shifts frequently interrupts the circadian rhythm.\nThe SAD sufferer normally wants little or nothing to do with social interaction outside of the home (their safe environment). People coming into the home can be met by such a depressed person that they do not stay very long.\nThese episodes of depression, which last about four to five months, include fatigue, sleeplessness and a tendency to overeat (particularly carbohydrates). Conversely, there is a small percentage of people with SAD who have a tendency to under-eat and they sleep for long periods of time.\nDepression linked to Seasonal Affective Disorder is not gender-specific, although women have twice the rate of depression than men and it varies in degrees with the person. The elderly, adolescents, women who have given birth or are going through menopause and those with chronic medical conditions can be predisposed to Seasonal Affective Disorder.\nAccording to a 2011 New York Times article, researchers studied groups of parents, siblings and especially twins and found a strong genetic link where depression runs in families.\nSecond and third generation relatives were likely to experience a deeper depression if someone in the first generation has been diagnosed with it.\nMany prescription drugs, such as estrogen, progesterone, contraceptives, gastrointestinal drugs, blood pressure, steroids, and acne medications have depression as a side effect. Factor in some of the other symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder and a minor depression could easily become a major depression.\nSitting 18 to 24 inches from a light box for 30 minutes twice a day can help SAD sufferers. Do not look at the light but read or some other activity as long as light enters the eye. | Source\nIf a physician suspects Seasonal Affective Disorder, to determine the severity he should conduct a full evaluation using the current DSM-IV depression criteria, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.\nIt is equally important to determine if the depression the patient is experiencing is alcohol or medication-related or if it is cyclical, that is, happening at a certain time of the year or when a certain event occurs in their lives such as a recent change of residence, chemotherapy treatments or other recurring treatments, divorce, separation anxiety of a parent, child, or spouse, husband left on a work trip, etc..\nThe patient should always be in control of their treatment options. and get a second or even a third opinion to be comfortable with their treatment plan. The treatment for Seasonal Affective Disorder should vary with each patient's preference.\nIt is okay if the patient decides not to have any treatment. Considering the side effects of certain medications, sometimes no treatment is the best treatment.\nIf the patient agrees with a physician to treat their condition with medication, he will usually suggest an anti-depressant medication to help combat the highs and lows of mood swings and depression. This is the time to talk to him about alternative medicine, as discussed below.\nCognitive behavior therapy with a licensed psychologist is a good option for patients who are comfortable talking with a therapist.\nSome patients suffering with SAD say that using light therapy for 30 minutes per day for the duration of the winter season has provided good results. However, some patients report that when they discontinued light therapy after a week or two, their symptoms returned in intensity.\nPossible but mild side effects using light therapy: headache, nausea, eye strain, blurred vision, and agitation.\nLight therapy units range in price from $150 to as much as $600 with an average of $250. Medical insurance usually doesn't reimburse this type of therapy since it is not recognized as medically necessary. It never hurts to ask the doctor for a letter of medical necessity to see if the insurance company will pay for the unit. You'll never know unless you try.\nSome patients use negative air ionizers, trying to trick the brain into thinking it is summertime. I have no idea whether that works or not, but I do know that if it is 10 degrees outside, nothing will convince my brain that it is summertime.\nA preset timer turns on a light fixture before a patient awakens. The intensity of the light gradually increases over 90 minutes. Studies are optimistic.\nThe retina is sensitive to blue light and this affects circadian rhythm. Studies are still being conducted whether blue light has the same benefit as white light.\nResearchers tested Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and Light Therapy with 23 SAD patients for 90-minute twice a week for 6 weeks. Results: combined light therapy and SAD-tailored CBT reduced depressive symptoms with good remission rates. CBT, with or without light therapy, showed a significant reduction in depression recurrences during the following winter compared with light therapy alone. Patients in the CBT group w/no light therapy had asignificant decrease in depression severity at 1 year.\nLight (and Sunlight) Therapy For Seasonal Affective Disorder\nWhile alternative medicine shouldn't be your first \"go-to\" place, there are some remedies that could significantly help you in your treatment plan.\nCertain supplements and suggestions listed in this article may interfere with the function and effectiveness of certain anti-depressants, chemotherapy drugs, birth control pills, diet pills, blood pressure medications and certain changes in diet plans.\nBefore you take anyone's advice or start using home remedies (even if it is only vitamins or supplements), consult your medical provider to ask which supplements and over-the-counter remedies might affect any medications you are presently taking.\nTips For Seasonal Affective Disorder (Click to enlarge)\nAlways consult your medical provider before beginning any new treatment. | Source\nThe Society of Light Treatment and Biological Rhythms\n© 2015 awordlover\nSAD seems to be a hot topic in the news as of late, with winter temperatures and bad weather hitting the Northeast and Midwest recently. I thought it was more like cabin fever, so I didn't really know much about it until I picked it out of awordlover's stored articles and started reading. I thought this was a good time to post it.\nI can understand how emerging in the dark after a long day's work hours might affect one's moods, in addition to cold weather. Thank you for your comment.\nAlthough not depressed myself, I can certainly understand how the seasons can affect one's moods in this way. I lived in Maine for a period when I was younger.

Then there was the bitter cold adding to it.\nYes, as it says in awordlover's article, SAD can happen in the summer months (or any other time of the year), but it is more prevalent in winter months. Some people only experience it at Christmas Time.\nAlthough there are many other articles on the internet about SAD, this is simply awordlover's spin on the topic. Thank you for reading and for your comment.\nFor those having a continuing interest in this subject, do a Hub search as there are other Hub articles in addition to those showing here.\nThis was a fine article, and it is incumbent on all of us to be aware of SAD during the depth of winter each year.\nInterestingly, SAD can also happen in the summer, according to another Hub I recall reading on HP.\nJodah, I'm sorry to read about your wife. Some of the tips in this article might be helpful to lift her mood. Thanks for reading.\nDDE, thank you for reading and commenting.\nInteresting and very helpful. You certainly did y thorough research on this unique topic.\nThis was very interesting, I think my wife has S.A.D, but she already has sleep apnea, chronic fatigue and depression so it is probably all linked. She feels extra lethargic during long periods of cloudy and rainy weather. We get most of our rain in Summer here though.

You need to know that that causes your belly to bloat. You must shew the food into your mouth until it breaks down to small pieces before you swallow it if you want to avoid this problem. In addition of that, slow eating reduces your food intake, and that can be beneficial if you want to lose some weight.\nThis kind of disorder brings abdominal pain difficulty and bloating in absorbing nutrients and it affects the digestive tract. Because of the bacteria overgrowth, the intestines and the whole digestive system can be pretty sensitive and as a result of that inflammation can occur.\nUsing certain types of drugs, such as contraceptives and other hormonal pills can result with abdominal bloating. For instance, the pills that contain estrogen can slow down the digestive system, causing constipation and gases. The same result can be expected by the pain medications as well as antibiotics. While the antibiotics fight the bad bacteria they also hamper the good bacteria. This in turn can affect our intestinal health, causing flatulence and gases.\nLong term continuous sitting will cause many problems in the human body. One of these problems is bloated stomach. Namely, while we sit the organism slows down and same does the digestion and the metabolism. You need to consider taking a walk every hour just to restart your body.\nWe recommend you to listen to your body and consult your doctor whenever you feel that something is wrong.

In the beginning, they experience instead increased irascibility, an unforgiving sense of smell and a slowly spreading waistline.\nNew research at several centers, however, shows that quitting not only spares smokers well-documented harmful effects of tobacco -- elevated risk of heart disease and lung cancer -- but may improve health almost immediately, even in those who have smoked heavily for 50 years or more.\nA team of Houston medical researchers says elderly smokers who quit can reduce their risk of stroke and delay the onset of several forms of senility, including Alzheimer`s disease. The scientists say the amount of blood and oxygen reaching the brain increased dramatically in the 12 months after elderly smokers quit.\nThe study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, sharply contradicts the widely held belief that the health damage from smoking is irreversible and that quitting is a pointless exercise in self-denial.\nA North Carolina research group has found that younger women who quit smoking can increase their fertility and their chances of having a healthy child. And University of California researchers say that if they can persuade their husbands to stop smoking, younger women can significantly reduce their own risk of ``silent`` heart attacks.\nMedical authorities say there also are more subtle health benefits -- steadier heartbeat; sharper, brighter color vision; warmer fingers and toes; and fewer colds -- that result from quitting.\nWith the reawakening of taste buds, food becomes more savory. Medical researchers say that it is that sharpened appetite that typically causes new non-smokers to gain weight. They just as typically shed it by the end of their first year without tobacco.\nWrinkles, especially crow`s feet around the eyes and creases at the corners of the mouth, become less pronounced.\n``When you quit, you are doing something to retard the skin`s aging, like staying out of the sun,`` says Dr. Marilynne McKay, acting chairman of dermatology at the Emory University School of Medicine.\nNoticeable or not, the side effects of quitting arise from the complex interaction of smoke and the body`s internal chemistry. Many of the effects are more than cosmetic.\n``When people stop smoking, they stop inhaling the 6,000-plus chemicals in cigarette smoke,`` says Dr. Jesse L. Steinfeld, the former U.S. surgeon general who now heads the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta.\n``People stop hacking in the morning and coughing up sputum. Irritation and spasms in the lungs stop. Carbon monoxide in the bloodstream quickly drops from about 7 percent to 9 percent to about 1/2 percent.\n``Smoking also causes blood clots to form more rapidly. That stops fairly quickly. The risk of heart attack begins to decrease very rapidly,`` he says.\nInvestigators from Boston University and the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine say that among women who smoke, the risk of heart attacks returns to near normal within 12 months after their last cigarette.\nThe risk of lung cancer declines, too, but for up to 12 years may still be double that of someone who never smoked. Continued smoking, however, makes the risk 20 times greater.\nNew research also shows that the total number of cigarettes smoked in a lifetime is closely related to the severity of coronary artery disease.\n``We know that coming off cigarette smoking can improve circulation almost immediately,`` says Dr. Garnett J. Geisling Jr., a pulmonologist on the board of the American Lung Association of Georgia and president-elect of the Georgia Thoracic Society.\n``Cigarette smoking also causes recurrent acute bronchitis and it prolongs bronchitis and pneumonia. Even in a chronic patient, if you stop smoking, the recurrent episodes can cut back,`` he says.\nIn the hospital, a patient`s smoking can reduce his chances of surviving surgery. At the Medical College of Georgia, for example, several surgeons refuse to perform bypass surgery on patients who still smoke.\n``There is also very clear evidence that ulcers will heal faster if a smoker quits,`` says Dr. John Galambos, director of the division of digestive disease at Emory`s School of Medicine. Tobacco smoke stimulates the production of stomach acid that causes ulcers.\nIn addition to the benefits of quitting, recent research has further detailed the hazards of continuing to smoke, including:\n``Fetal tobacco syndrome,`` characterized by low-weight infants born to smoking mothers -- a condition researchers believe is caused by a reduction in the flow of oxygen and the blood supply to the developing embryo.\nNicotine addiction in the infants of smoking mothers. Studies also indicate a definite increase in early spontaneous abortions among smoking mothers.\nReductions in fertility by more than one-third among women who smoke, with the greatest loss of fertility among heavy smokers.\nAlthough 29 percent of American adults still smoke, smoking per capita continues to drop among all population groups, but not as quickly among women, especially young white women.

At the vast majority of publishers, peer reviewers gain zero recognition and zero reward for their invaluable work, and so it really isn't surprising that journals find it hard to persuade reviewers to devote many hours of work to a review with no hope of being credited or rewarded for that work.\nFortunately, we believe that PeerJ provides some powerful solutions to this problem. First of all, we have a solution to the problem of 'lack of credit' via our system of Open Peer Review. Specifically, reviewers are given the option of making their name known to the authors, and if they do so (and if the authors choose to publish the review history on the final article), then the work that the reviewer submitted is identified with their name and they gain public credit for having performed the review. Even if the authors chose not to publish their review history then reviewers who provided their name in the process still accrue 'contribution points' for their review. We believe that this solution allows reviewers to be appropriately acknowledged for their work and (because most authors choose to publish their review history) in most cases the text that the reviewer contributed is also made public and not 'lost' to the world. Examples of reviewers being credited in this way include Kevin Black who peer-reviewed \"Whose name is it anyway? Varying patterns of possessive usage in eponymous neurodegenerative diseases\" and Ken Takahashi who peer-reviewed \"A non-cardiomyocyte autonomous mechanism of cardioprotection involving the SLO1 BK channel\". When these individuals perform more 'public' peer reviews then that fact will be reflected on their public profiles (note: reviewers must choose to make their profiles 'public' in order to gain this public recognition, otherwise their contributions remain unacknowledged).\nAs to the second problem – lack of tangible reward – we are pleased to announce a new 'reviewer reward' program for any PeerJ peer reviewer who submits their review on time. Specifically, reviewers who submit an on-time peer review to PeerJ will now be credited with a limited time (12 month) Basic PeerJ Membership. By introducing this benefit, we are acknowledging the hard work that goes into reviewing, by providing those reviewers with a tangible benefit for their work. This benefit means that if a reviewer chooses to submit an article to PeerJ within 12 months of completing their on-time review then they will not need to buy a membership for that publication (although any co-authors would still need to be paying Members, as normal). They can also take full advantage of unlimited submissions to PeerJ PrePrints for as long as their temporary membership is in place.\nThere is some small print (see below) but we hope and expect that this new benefit will be well received by our reviewers who will understand that we truly appreciate the efforts they make when submitting their reviews in a timely manner.\nPeerJ Reviewer Rewards – the small print\n* The Reviewer Reward is only provided to those reviewers who submit an invited peer-review to PeerJ within the agreed review deadline.\n* Although PeerJ Memberships are normally 'for life', in the case of this benefit reviewers are only credited with a limited time Basic PeerJ Membership. This limited time Membership lasts for 12 months and then reverts to a Free Membership (unless the individual has chosen to purchase a paid membership in the meantime).\n* Basic Membership entitles an author to publish one paper per year for free. Therefore this Reviewer Reward means that an on-time reviewer can publish a single paper with us, within 12 months, without needing to become a paying Member (and they can also take full advantage of unlimited submissions to PeerJ PrePrints).\n* The normal PeerJ membership requirements apply to any co-authors of a submission (i.e. all other co-authors would still need to be Members with the correct Membership Status).\n* This benefit is for a single individual and is not transferable. If a reviewer is already a paying Member then this reward does not apply.\n* This benefit is not cumulative within the 12 month time-frame. If an individual reviews more than one paper in the 12 month period then although they earn our gratitude, they would only receive the one credit.\n* Although receiving this credit does not obligate the recipient in any way, Reviewers can choose to decline this credit – just email us to let us know.\nA5M | Doctors & Health Professionals - A5M - The AustralAsian Academy of Anti-Ageing Medicine\nAnti-Ageing Medicine Trends\nAnti-Ageing Medicine is the fastest-growing medical specialty in the world.

J Am Coll Cardiol , 46 (2) pp. 344-350. 10.1016/j.jacc.2005.03.068.\nOBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate the role of cortisol in stress-induced endothelial dysfunction and impaired baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) by blocking cortisol production with metyrapone before subjecting healthy volunteers to mental stress. BACKGROUND: Mental stress raises cortisol levels and is associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity and mortality, especially from sudden cardiac death. It also causes endothelial dysfunction and impaired BRS. METHODS: We measured brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), a measure of endothelial function, and BRS in 36 subjects without CHD risk factors who were then randomized in a double-blind fashion to oral metyrapone 750 mg x 2 or placebo. Five hours later we subjected subjects to mental stress and then remeasured endothelial function and BRS. RESULTS: Prestress cortisol levels were significantly higher in the placebo group at 270.5 (30.9) nmol/l versus 89.1 (11.8) nmol/l (p = 0.01), and the increase with stress was higher at 57.9 (17.9) nmol/l versus 11.2 (2.2) nmol/l (p < 0.001). In the placebo group, compared to baseline, FMD and BRS fell significantly from 4.5% (0.7%) to 1.4% (1.1%) (p = 0.02) and 21.4 (2.3) ms/mmHg to 16.3 (1.5) ms/mmHg (p = 0.04), respectively. In the metyrapone group, FMD and BRS were unchanged from baseline: 4.3% (0.9%) versus 5.1% (0.8%) (p = 0.48) and 26.4 (2.9) ms/mmHg versus 24.9 (2.6) ms/mmHg (p = 0.62), respectively. Analysis of covariation showed a significant effect of metyrapone on change in both FMD (p = 0.009) and BRS (p = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Stress-related endothelial dysfunction and BRS impairment can be prevented by blocking cortisol production with metyrapone, demonstrating a direct or facilitative role for cortisol in these phenomena and suggesting mechanisms by which stress contributes to CHD and sudden cardiac death.\n10.1016/j.jacc.2005.03.068\nAdult, Baroreflex, Blood Pressure, Brachial Artery, Coronary Disease, Double-Blind Method, Electrocardiography, Endothelium, Vascular, Enzyme Inhibitors, Female, Heart Rate, Humans, Hydrocortisone, Male, Metyrapone, Monitoring, Physiologic, Nitric Oxide, Regional Blood Flow, Stress, Psychological, Ultrasonography, Vasodilation\nCould ketamine be the answer to treating treatment-resistant major depressive disorder? | General Psychiatry\nCould ketamine be the answer to treating treatment-resistant major depressive disorder?\nAbdullah Mohammed Ramadan and\nIslam Ahmed Mansour\nPsychiatry, Mansoura University Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura, Egypt\nCorrespondence to Dr Abdullah Mohammed Ramadan; boodi000{at}icloud.com\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, serious, debilitating condition affecting 350 million people worldwide, which remains to be unsatisfactorily treated with 53% of patients still complaining of symptoms after completing their courses with the correct dosage. Ketamine, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019, is a potential treatment option for those recalcitrant cases. The mechanism of ketamine is not fully understood, but as type it is classified as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist, and can be given intravenously, intranasally and orally. It is used to treat treatment-resistant depression, depression associated with suicidal ideation, mood and anxiety disorders and depressions associated with either type of bipolar disorder. Although ketamine is considered relatively safe, several side effects have been reported with the major ones being psychiatric in the form of worsening mood, anxiety and agitation; psychotomimetic in the form of dissociation, perceptual disturbance and abnormal sensations; cardiovascular in the form of increased blood pressure and increased heart rate; and neurological in the form of headache and dizziness. Ketamine is still not approved worldwide for usage in patients with treatment-resistant MDD, but if it is approved sometime in the future with relatively fewer side effects, it is expected to significantly save millions of dollars spent yearly on patients with treatment-resistant depression and that will lift this major burden off the shoulders of healthcare professionals. This study was designed to measure the effects of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, on patients with treatment-resistant MDD and to analyse the concept that makes it different and relatively safer than other major antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants).\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100227\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious condition that affects the lives of many individuals globally. It is estimated that the total number of cases diagnosed with MDD is 350 million people around the world.1 2 And eight hundred thousand patients die every year due to suicidal ideation caused by MDD. MDD poses major burdens to the healthcare systems of different countries around the world.1–3 Despite the different treatment options available in the form of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), none of them were capable of completely relieving the symptoms of depression and many cases have reported frequent relapses, almost 53%, after completing the courses of their medications with the appropriate doses2 with 20% failing to show improvement on usage of subsequent lines of therapy.2 4 The current economic burden of MDD in the USA alone is estimated at $29–$48 billion per year.5 In fact, it carries a major economic burden in the form of the requirement of numerous emergency rooms, lacking of responsiveness to the current medications and major unemployment to many healthcare professionals.2 6\nCurrently, there is no consensus on the definition of treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but the current definition is that it is any form of depression in which the patient is not fully relieved from the major symptoms of depression after taking the appropriate courses of at least two antidepressant medications at their adequate time duration.2–5 The main limitation in the usage of these agents, besides the lack of appropriate responsiveness, is the fact that they could take more than 2–4 weeks in order for the initial response to be felt by the patients; in addition numerous studies have shown that many patients report multisystemic, unbearable side effects.7 8\nIn March 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new antidepressant medication under the name of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of glutamate receptor antagonist. This review is dedicated to knowing the pharmacological details of this medication and how it is different from other antidepressants in the management of TRD.7 8\nKetamine is not a perfect drug. Although studies in many patients have been shown to produce positive results in patients with TRD, they have shown that significant side effects have caused many cases to cease undergoing drug trials. Especially patients with chronic cardiovascular conditions like myocardial infarction, arteriovenous fistulae and chronic hypertension should not be allowed to use ketamine.\nKetamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist that is used in the management of TRDs, depression associated with suicidal ideation, mood and anxiety disorders and depressions associated with either type of bipolar disorder. Unlike other NMDA antagonists, like memantine that is used in the symptomatic management of Alzheimer's disease, the mechanism by which ketamine deals with depression follows a different pathway. It is not fully understood how ketamine treats depression, but it works by different mechanisms. Ketamine could be given by three different methods: orally, intravenously and nasally.9 10\nThe majority of the randomised controlled trials using a dose of 0.5 mg/kg over 40 min of intravenous ketamine followed by a 20% saline infusion washout have shown significant improvement in depression symptoms and suicidal ideation within 1 week as measured using the Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).11 12 Response rates for patients using intravenous ketamine were shown to be 50%–70%, which proves to be better than other classes of antidepressants.13 14 Most of the patients have not reported any serious side effects12; however, some patients decided to stop taking the drug after showing major side effects.\nThe US FDA has recently approved the usage of intranasal esketamine along with an oral antidepressant. The doses used in most of the studies were an initial dose of 28 mg/kg and a maintenance dose of 56 or 84 mg/kg. Most cases have statistically shown significant improvements over 40 min according to the MADRS score. Some major side effects were shown in some patients mainly because of the high level of bioavailability of esketamine as it has no first-pass metabolism.15\nThose side effects included dissociation, fatigue, poor memory, severe headaches, nausea, elevated heart rate and blood pressure.\nOral ketamine undergoes a high level of the first-pass metabolism which makes its bioavailability less than 20%. A small open-label study of oral ketamine with a dose of 0.5 mg/kg in hospice patients for 28 days has shown a significant improvement in the MADRS depression scale.16–18 The time to response was 1–2 weeks; however, some patients have decided to withdraw from the trial due to lack of response. Dizziness, delirium, hallucinations, nausea, vomiting and headache were the reported side effects in most of the studies.9\nCurrently, there is no full consensus among authors on the exact mechanism/s by which ketamine plays a role in the management of TRD. Basically, ketamine is an antagonist that blocks the NMDA receptors, but evidence based on numerous studies has proven that the rapid antidepressant (RAAD) effect that ketamine establishes is not based on its NMDA receptor antagonism. While other FDA-approved antidepressants have their antidepressant roles derived from their effects on monoamines such as serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, the emergence of ketamine has provided a new perspective that is based on its effects on the glutamate system providing RAAD effects within 4 hours with a long-term effect that lasts for 1 week after a single dose.19\nNumerous publications have stated that ketamine induces synaptogenesis at the level of the prefrontal cortex, a part of the brain that atrophies in depressed patients.20 Other studies have also shown that ketamine upregulates the activity of a certain type of receptors called glutamate alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) which plays an important role in increasing the levels of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) which induces synaptogenesis at the level of the prefrontal cortex.21 22 Some authors have come to merge the two hypotheses, as shown in figure 1, concluding that the NMDA receptor antagonistic effect of ketamine on GABAergic interneurons induces the release of glutamate from the prefrontal cortex which in turn activates the AMPA receptors. This activation has been shown to urge the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, both of which act on inducing the mTOR, which induces synaptogenesis at the prefrontal cortex level.23–25 This cycle is thought to be relevant to the antidepressant effect of ketamine.\nKetamine works by two currently merged mechanisms: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor mechanisms. The NMDA receptor antagonistic effect of ketamine on GABAergic interneurons induces the release of glutamate from the prefrontal cortex which in turn activates the AMPA receptors. AMPAR, AMPA receptor; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; GABA, gamma-aminobutyric acid; GLT-1, glutamate transporter 1; NMDAR, NMDA receptor.\nSide effects reported from 60 studies have shown a variety of adverse effects affecting various body systems: psychiatric, cardiovascular, neurological, cognitive and others. Those studies involved 899 patients who received at least one dose of ketamine.26 Psychiatric side effects were described in 38% of the studies, whereas psychotomimetic ones were described in 72%. The psychiatric side effects included most commonly anxiety, followed by agitation and irritability, delusions and mood elevation. Less common side effects included detachment, emotional blunting, psychosis, craving attention and formal thought disorder. Only one case of suicidal attempt was reported in one study.27 The most commonly reported side effects from most studies that led the participants to withdraw from the trial included worsening mood (12 participants), anxiety (6 participants) and suicidal ideation (5 participants). The psychotomimetic side effects most commonly included dissociation, perceptual disturbance, odd or abnormal sensation, derealisation, hallucinations and depersonalisation. The only cases reported to withdraw from the trials were the ones who suffered dissociation.28 29 Most studies that used the intravenous route of administration rather than the other routes were the ones who mostly had psychiatry and psychotomimetic side effects. WHO has classified ketamine as a Schedule III drug as it carries a potential risk for addiction and abuse. It can be abused in any administered form, intravenously, orally or nasally. Ketamine has a potential risk of abuse by patients self-medicating themselves from depression.\nThirty-eight percent of the 60 studies reported cardiovascular side effects. Most of these changes were in the form of increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, arrhythmia, palpitations, dizziness, chest tightness and decreased blood pressure on standing. Only five cases withdrew from the studies due to serious cardiovascular effects. Most of those effects were also reported on the usage of intravenous ketamine infusion. Those effects only lasted 90 min reportedly.\nThe most commonly reported neurological side effects were headache and dizziness. The most commonly reported cognitive side effects included poor memory, poor concentration, confusion and cognitive impairment.\nMultiple other side effects were reported in 32 (53%) of the studies, these side effects were mainly gastrointestinal, ocular, respiratory and urological.\nThe most frequently reported other side effects included blurred vision and nausea. Less commonly reported ones were insomnia, general malaise, fatigue, restlessness, dry mouth, vomiting and tearfulness.27\nCertain types of drugs should not be used concomitantly with any form of ketamine. Some of these drugs can interfere with the first-pass metabolism in case of being used with oral or intravenous ketamine, others may cause cardiovascular problems especially in individuals with cardiovascular diseases. Such drugs include benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, opioids and alcohol which may all cause sedation. Blood pressure and heart monitoring should be measured in case of using drugs like MAOIs, TCAs, SSRIs, modafinil, armodafinil and amphetamine types of drugs.30 Clonidine can be used safely with esketamine as it can reduce esketamine's ability to cause hypertension and other side effects.31 Midazolam reduces the sympathomimetic effects of ketamine.32 Certain CYP(Cytochrome P450) enzyme inducers like rifampicin can reduce the concentration of esketamine and norketamine by 10% and 50%, respectively.33 Coadministration of ketamine and ticlopidine has been proven to increase the maximum plasma concentration of ketamine by 72% and total hepatic clearance by 15.5%.34\nSince getting approved for usage by the FDA in March 2019, ketamine has been a glimpse of hope to patients with treatment-resistant MDD due to its rapid efficacy and relatively less adverse effects in comparison to other antidepressant medications. This has proved some relief to the patients, their families, clinicians and world governments' healthcare budgets as well as to the economic burden that treating patients with depression causes to healthcare institutes. However, this interest should not become absolute as the studies that were made for testing ketamine are relatively small and some of the studies made showed considerable risks for abuse and addiction. In addition, ketamine had been shown to cause many side effects in multiple cases. Further studies should be made focused on understanding more about the mechanism of action of ketamine, as most of the studies differ quite significantly on how ketamine acts on depression. They should also focus on limiting the potential risk of addiction that ketamine carries. That could further help in increasing the efficacy and limiting the adverse effects of ketamine.\nRosenblat JD ,\nCha DS , et al\n.

        "description": "Schizoaffective disorder (SZA, SZD or SAD) is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal thought processes and an unstable mood.[5][6] The diagnosis is made when the person has symptoms of both schizophrenia (usually psychosis) and a mood disorder—either bipolar disorder or depression.[5][6] The main criterion for the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis is the presence of psychotic symptoms for at least two weeks without any mood symptoms present.[6] Schizoaffective disorder can often be misdiagnosed[6] when the correct diagnosis may be psychotic depression, psychotic bipolar disorder, schizophreniform disorder, or schizophrenia. It is imperative for providers to accurately diagnose patients, as treatment and prognosis differs greatly for each of these diagnoses.[6][7]\nPsychotic depression, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, schizophreniform disorder, schizophrenia\nThere are two types of schizoaffective disorder: the bipolar type, which is distinguished by symptoms of mania, hypomania, or mixed episode; and the depressive type, which is distinguished by symptoms of depression only.[5][6] Common symptoms of the disorder include hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and thinking.[8] Auditory hallucinations, or \"hearing voices\", are most common.[9] The onset of symptoms usually begins in young adulthood.\nThe mainstay of current treatment is antipsychotic medication combined with mood stabilizer medication or antidepressant medication, or both. There is growing concern by some researchers that antidepressants may increase psychosis, mania, and long-term mood episode cycling in the disorder.[citation needed] When there is risk to self or others, usually early in treatment, hospitalization may be necessary.[10] Psychiatric rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and vocational rehabilitation are very important for recovery of higher psychosocial function. As a group, people with schizoaffective disorder that were diagnosed using DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria (which have since been updated) have a better outcome,[5][6] but have variable individual psychosocial functional outcomes compared to people with mood disorders, from worse to the same.[6][11][non-primary source needed] Outcomes for people with DSM-5 diagnosed schizoaffective disorder depend on data from prospective cohort studies, which have not been completed yet.[6] The DSM-5 diagnosis was updated because DSM-IV criteria resulted in overuse of the diagnosis;[10] that is, DSM-IV criteria led to many patients being misdiagnosed with the disorder. DSM-IV prevalence estimates were less than one percent of the population, in the range of 0.5–0.8 percent;[12] newer DSM-5 prevalence estimates are not yet available.\nSchizoaffective disorder is defined by mood disorder-free psychosis in the context of a long-term psychotic and mood disorder.[6] Psychosis must meet criterion A for schizophrenia which may include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and speech or behavior and negative symptoms.[6] Both delusions and hallucinations are classic symptoms of psychosis.[13] Delusions are false beliefs which are strongly held despite evidence to the contrary.[13] Beliefs should not be considered delusional if they are in keeping with cultural beliefs. Delusional beliefs may or may not reflect mood symptoms (for example, someone experiencing depression may or may not experience delusions of guilt). Hallucinations are disturbances in perception involving any of the five senses, although auditory hallucinations (or \"hearing voices\") are the most common. Negative symptoms include alogia (poverty of speech), blunted affect (reduced intensity of outward emotional expression), avolition (lack of motivation), and anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure).[13] Negative symptoms can be more lasting and more debilitating than positive symptoms of psychosis.\nMood symptoms are of mania, hypomania, mixed episode, or depression, and tend to be episodic rather than continuous. A mixed episode represents a combination of symptoms of mania and depression at the same time. Symptoms of mania include elevated or irritable mood, grandiosity (inflated self-esteem), agitation, risk-taking behavior, decreased need for sleep, poor concentration, rapid speech, and racing thoughts.[13] Symptoms of depression include low mood, apathy, changes in appetite or weight, disturbances in sleep, changes in motor activity, fatigue, guilt or feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thinking.\nA combination of genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role in the development of schizoaffective disorder.[14][15]\nViewed broadly then, biological and environmental factors interact with a person's genes in ways which may increase or decrease the risk for developing schizoaffective disorder; exactly how this happens (the biological mechanism) is not yet known. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders, of which schizoaffective disorder is a part, have been increasingly linked to advanced paternal age at the time of conception, a known cause of genetic mutations.[16] The physiology of people diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder appears to be similar, but not identical, to that of those diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; however, human neurophysiological function in normal brain and mental disorder syndromes is not fully understood.[9]\nSubstance use disorderEdit\nA clear causal connection between substance use and psychotic spectrum disorders, including schizoaffective disorder, has been difficult to prove. In the specific case of cannabis (marijuana), however, evidence supports a link between earlier onset of psychotic illness and cannabis use.[17] The more often cannabis is used, particularly in early adolescence, the more likely a person is to develop a psychotic illness,[18][19][20] with frequent use being correlated with double the risk of psychosis and schizoaffective disorder.[21] A 2009 Yale review stated that in individuals with an established psychotic disorder, cannabinoids can exacerbate symptoms, trigger relapse, and have negative consequences on the course of the illness.[22] While cannabis use is accepted as a contributory cause of schizoaffective disorder by many,[23] it remains controversial,[24][25] since not all young people who use cannabis later develop psychosis, but those who do use cannabis have an increased odds ratio of about 3.[26] Certain drugs can imitate symptoms of schizophrenia (which we know has similar symptoms to schizoaffective disorder). This is important to note when including that substance-induced psychosis should be ruled out when diagnosing patients so that patients are not misdiagnosed.[6]\nPsychosis as a symptom of a psychiatric disorder is first and foremost a diagnosis of exclusion.[27] So a new-onset episode of psychosis cannot be considered to be a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known medical causes of psychosis are excluded, or ruled out.[27] Many clinicians improperly perform, or entirely miss this step, introducing avoidable diagnostic error and misdiagnosis.[27]\nDelirium should be ruled out, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, indicating other underlying factors which includes medical illnesses.[27] Excluding medical illnesses associated with psychosis is performed by using blood tests to measure:\nBecause psychosis may be precipitated or exacerbated by common classes of psychiatric medications, such as antidepressants,[28][29][30][31][32] ADHD stimulant medications,[33][34][35] and sleep medications,[36][37] prescribed medication-induced psychosis should be ruled out, particularly for first-episode psychosis.[27] This is an essential step to reduce diagnostic error and to evaluate potential medication sources of further patient harm.[27] Regarding prescribed medication sources of patient harm, Yale School of Medicine Professor of Psychiatry Malcolm B. Bowers, Jr, MD wrote:[38][self-published source]\nIt is important to be understood here. I want to call attention to the fact that some persons with a family history of even the subtler forms of bipolar disorder or psychosis are more vulnerable than others to the mania- or psychosis-inducing potential of antidepressants, stimulants and sleeping medications. While I'm not making a blanket statement against these medications, I am urging caution in their use. I believe [clinicians] should ask patients and their families whether there is a family history of bipolar disorder or psychosis before prescribing these medications. Most patients and their families don't know the answer when they are first asked, so time should be allowed for the patient to ask family or relatives, between the session when asked by [the clinician] and a follow-up session. This may increase the wait for a medication slightly, but because some patients are vulnerable, this is a necessary step for [the clinician] to take. I believe that psychiatry as a field has not emphasized this point sufficiently. As a result, some patients have been harmed by the very treatments that were supposed to help them; or to the disgrace of psychiatry, harmed and then misdiagnosed.[28][29][30][31][34][35][36][37]\nSome dietary supplements may also induce psychosis or mania, but cannot be ruled out with laboratory tests. So a psychotic person's family, partner, or friends should be asked whether he or she is currently taking any dietary supplements.[39]\nCommon mistakes made when diagnosing psychotic patients include:[27]\nNot screening for dissociative disorders. Dissociative identity disorder and psychotic symptoms in schizoaffective disorder have considerable overlap, yet a different overall treatment approach.[40]\nDSM-5 requires two episodes of psychosis (whereas DSM-IV needed only one) to qualify for the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis.[6] As such, it is no longer an \"episode diagnosis.\"[6] The new schizoaffective framework looks at the time from \"the [first episode of] psychosis up to the current episode [of psychosis], rather than only defining a single episode with [co-occurring] psychotic and mood syndromes.\"[6] Specifically, one of the episodes of psychosis must last a minimum of two weeks without mood disorder symptoms, but the person may be mildly to moderately depressed while psychotic.[6] The other period of psychosis \"requires the overlap of mood [disorder] symptoms with psychotic symptoms to be conspicuous\" and last for a greater portion of the disorder.[41]\nIf the schizoaffective diagnosis is used less often, other diagnoses (like psychotic mood disorders and schizophrenia) are likely to be used more often; but this is hypothetical until real-world data arrive. Validity problems with the diagnosis remain and await further work in the fields of psychiatric genetics, neuroimaging, and cognitive science that includes the overlapping fields of cognitive, affective, and social neuroscience, which may change the way schizoaffective disorder is conceptualized and defined in future versions of the DSM and ICD.[6][42]\nProblems with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorderEdit\nThe American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder persisted for 19 years (1994–2013). Clinicians adequately trained in diagnosis used the schizoaffective diagnosis too often,[6] largely because the criteria were poorly defined, ambiguous, and hard to use (or poorly operationalized).[6][43] Poorly trained clinicians used the diagnosis without making necessary exclusions of common causes of psychosis, including some prescribed psychiatric medications.[6] Specialty books written by experts on schizoaffective disorder have existed for over eight years before DSM-5 describing the overuse of the diagnosis.[44][45][46][47]\nIn April 2009, Carpenter and the DSM-5 schizoaffective disorder workgroup reported that they were \"developing new criteria for schizoaffective disorder to improve reliability and face validity,\" and were \"determining whether the dimensional assessment of mood [would] justify a recommendation to drop schizoaffective disorder as a diagnostic category.\"[12] Speaking to an audience at the May 2009 annual conference of the American Psychiatric Association, Carpenter said:[12]\nBut DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder carries an unnecessarily worse prognosis than a \"mood disorder with psychotic features\" diagnosis,[6] because long-term data revealed that a significant proportion of DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder patients had 15-year outcomes indistinguishable from patients with mood disorders with or without psychotic features,[6][11] even though the clinical picture at the time of first diagnosis looked different from both schizophrenia and mood disorders.[6][11]\nDSM-5 research directionsEdit\nA core concept in modern psychiatry since DSM-III was released in 1980, is the categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia, known as the Kraepelinian dichotomy. Emil Kraepelin introduced the idea that schizophrenia was separate from mood disorders after observing patients with symptoms of psychosis and mood disorder, over a century ago, in 1898. This was a time before genetics were known and before any treatments existed for mental illness.[48] The Kraepelinian dichotomy was not used for DSM-I and DSM-II because both manuals were influenced by the dominant psychodynamic psychiatry of the time,[49] but the designers of DSM-III wanted to use more scientific and biological definitions.[49] Consequently, they looked to psychiatry's history and decided to use the Kraepelinian dichotomy as a foundation for the classification system.\nThe Kraepelinian dichotomy continues to be used in DSM-5 despite having been challenged by data from modern psychiatric genetics for over eight years,[50] and there is now evidence of a significant overlap in the genetics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.[48] According to this genetic evidence, the Kraepelinian categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia at the foundation of the current classification and diagnostic system is a mistaken false dichotomy.[48][51]\nThe dichotomy at the foundation of the current system forms the basis for a convoluted schizoaffective disorder definition in DSM-IV that resulted in excessive misdiagnosis.[6] Real life schizoaffective disorder patients have significant and enduring symptoms that bridge what are incorrectly assumed to be categorically separate disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.[52] People with psychotic depression, bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis, and schizophrenia with mood symptoms also have symptoms that bridge psychosis and mood disorders.[48][51] The categorical diagnostic manuals do not reflect reality in their separation of psychosis (via the schizophrenia diagnosis) from mood disorder, nor do they currently emphasize the actual overlap found in real-life patients.[48][51] Thus, they are likely to continue to introduce either-or conceptual and diagnostic error, by way of confirmation bias into clinicians' mindsets, hindering accurate assessment and treatment.[48][51]\nThe new definition continues the lack of parsimony of the old definition.[6][52] Simpler, clearer, and more usable definitions of the diagnosis were supported by certain members of the DSM-5 workgroup (see next paragraph); these were debated but deemed premature, because more \"research [is] needed to establish a new classification system of equal or greater validity\"[52] to the existing system.[6][52] Because of DSM-5's continuing problematic categorical foundation, schizoaffective disorder's conceptual and diagnostic validity remains doubtful.[48][51] After enough research is completed and data exists, future diagnostic advances will need to either eliminate and replace, or soften and bridge, the hard categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia; most likely using a spectrum or dimensional approach to diagnosis.[6][51]\nThe field of psychiatry has begun to question its assumptions and analyze its data in order to merge closer with evidence-based medicine.[51] The removal of the \"episode diagnosis\", and the addition of two episodes of psychosis, as qualifications for the DSM-5 schizoaffective diagnosis, may improve the diagnosis' consistency over DSM-IV for research purposes, where diagnostic criteria are by necessity followed exactingly.[41] But the new definition remains long, unwieldy, and perhaps still not very useful for community clinicians—with two psychoses, one for two weeks minimum and without mood disorder (but the person can be mildly or moderately depressed) and the other with significant mood disorder and psychosis lasting for most of the time, and with lasting mood symptoms for most of the residual portion of the illness.[6][41] Community clinicians used the previous definition \"for about a third of cases with non-affective psychotic disorders.\"[6] Non-affective psychotic disorders are, by definition, not schizoaffective disorder. For clinicians to make such sizeable errors of misdiagnosis may imply systemic problems with the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis itself. Already, at least one expert believes the new schizoaffective definition has not gone far enough to solve the previous definition's problems.[41]\nFrom a scientific standpoint, modern clinical psychiatry is still a very young, underdeveloped medical specialty because its target organ, the human brain, is not yet well understood. The human brain's neural circuits, for example, are just beginning to be mapped by modern neuroscience in the Human Connectome Project and CLARITY. Clinical psychiatry, furthermore, has begun to understand and acknowledge its current limitations—but further steps by the field are required to significantly reduce misdiagnosis and patient harm; this is crucial both for responsible patient care and to retain public trust. Looking forward, a paradigm shift is needed in psychiatric research to address unanswered questions about schizoaffective disorder. The dimensional Research Domain Criteria project currently being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Mental Health, may be the specific problem solving framework psychiatry needs to develop a more scientifically mature understanding of schizoaffective disorder as well as all other mental disorders.[53]\nThe primary treatment of schizoaffective disorder is medication, with improved outcomes using combined long-term psychological and social supports.[14] Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization started in the 1950s, although it still occurs.[10] Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment[54] and support groups are common. Evidence indicates that regular exercise has a positive effect on the physical and mental health of those with schizoaffective disorder.[55]\nSkillfully delivered psychosocial treatments are perhaps the most important component of pushing for and encouraging improved overall functioning in schizoaffective disorder. Supportive psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are both helpful.[56] Intensive case management (ICM) has been shown to reduce hospitalizations, improve adherence to treatment, and improve social functioning.[57] With ICM, clients are assigned a case manager responsible for coordination of care and assisting clients to access supports to address needs in multiple areas related to well-being, including housing.\nHigh quality psychosocial or psychiatric rehabilitation is very important for recovery from schizoaffective disorder. Psychiatric or psychosocial rehabilitation focuses on solving community integration problems such as obtaining and keeping housing and increasing involvement in positive social groups. It also focuses on improving and increasing activities of daily living; increasing daily healthy habits (such as normalizing sleep-wake cycles; increasing early morning natural light exposure; increasing moderate exercise [such as 20–30 minutes of moderate to brisk early morning to pre-afternoon walking daily, in order to help normalize circadian rhythms]; helping individuals understand the specific benefits of healthy food choices; increasing stress-reduction activities such as yoga, tai chi, or meditation); and decreasing unhealthy behaviors (such as substance use and smoking); thereby significantly improving quality of life. High quality psychiatric rehabilitation may also focus on vocational rehabilitation including preparing the client for volunteer, part-time paid work, returning to school for further education, job skills training for full-time flexible or supported employment, and other client self-improvement efforts. Core principles of effective psychiatric rehabilitation must include providing hope when the client lacks it, respect for the client wherever they are in the recovery process, empowering the client, teaching the client wellness planning, and emphasizing the importance for the client to develop social support networks.[58] A long-term goal of psychiatric and vocational rehabilitation is that the client learn and actively engage in active stress management while in education or employment, while receiving treatment.\nAntipsychotic medication is usually required both for acute treatment and the prevention of relapse.[13][59] There is no single antipsychotic of choice in treating schizoaffective disorder, but atypical antipsychotics should be considered because they have mood-stabilizing activity.[13][56] Paliperidone is an antipsychotic with FDA approval for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder.[60] Antipsychotics should be used at the minimum dose necessary to control symptoms.[56] Potential side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms, including tremor, muscle stiffness, and restlessness or akathisia.[61] Atypical antipsychotics carry a risk of metabolic syndrome, including weight gain, increased blood sugar, and increased blood cholesterol, so regular monitoring of weight and blood work should be carried out.[61] Some atypical antipsychotics, such as ziprasidone and aripiprazole, are associated with less risk than others, such as olanzapine.[56][61] Medication choice is based on how effectively it reduces symptoms, how few side effects it causes, and cost.\nIn people with treatment-refractory psychosis, a clozapine trial should be considered.[13] Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is recognized as being particularly effective when other antipsychotic agents have failed.[61] Clozapine should also be considered in people with chronic and persistent suicidal thinking and behaviour, as it has been shown to reduce the risk of suicide in patients with schizoaffective disorder and a history of suicidality.[59] Between 0.5 and 2% of patients taking clozapine may develop a life-threatening complication called agranulocytosis, which is a significant drop in a type of white blood cell.[62] Because of this risk, people taking clozapine must have regular monitoring of blood cell counts.[62]\nThe management of the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder is similar to the treatment of bipolar disorder, with the goal of preventing mood episodes and cycling.[61] Lithium or anticonvulsant mood stabilizers such as valproic acid, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine are prescribed in combination with an antipsychotic.[56]\nFor depression, if an antidepressant is prescribed, extra attentiveness must be given by the prescribing clinician due its risk for long-term mood cycle acceleration (that is, inducing more frequent episodes of depression per unit of time) and prescribed medication-induced psychosis or mania.[28][29][30][31] For individuals who show emerging psychosis, mania, mixed episode symptoms, or mood cycle acceleration, switching to an antipsychotic plus lithium or lamotrigine is preferable to antidepressants.\nFor individuals who experience anxiety, anti-anxiety medications can be used, usually on a short-term basis.[56] Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, clonazepam and diazepam, are types of anti-anxiety medications. Care must be taken when prescribing benzodiazepines due to the risk of the person developing tolerance and dependence.[61]\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for patients with schizoaffective disorder experiencing severe depression or severe psychotic symptoms that have not responded to treatment with antipsychotics.[59]\nSchizoaffective disorder is estimated to occur in 0.5 to 0.8 percent of people at some point in their life.[63] 30% of cases occur between the ages of 25 and 35.[64] It is more common in women than men; however, this is because of the high concentration of women in the depressive subcategory, whereas the bipolar subtype has a more or less even gender distribution.[citation needed]\nThe term schizoaffective psychosis was introduced by the American psychiatrist Jacob Kasanin in 1933[65] to describe an episodic psychotic illness with predominant affective symptoms, that was thought at the time to be a good-prognosis schizophrenia.[66] Kasanin's concept of the illness was influenced by the psychoanalytic teachings of Adolf Meyer and Kasanin postulated that schizoaffective psychosis was caused by \"emotional conflicts\" of a \"mainly sexual nature\" and that psychoanalysis \"would help prevent the recurrence of such attacks.\"[67] He based his description on a case study of nine individuals.[67]\nOther psychiatrists, before and after Kasanin, have made scientific observations of schizoaffective disorder based on assumptions of a biological and genetic cause of the illness. In 1863, German psychiatrist Karl Kahlbaum (1828–1899) described schizoaffective disorders as a separate group in his vesania typica circularis.[68] Kahlbaum distinguished between cross-sectional and longitudinal observations. (Cross-sectional refers to observation of a single, specific episode of the illness, for example, one episode of psychotic depression; while longitudinal refers to long-term observation of many distinct episodes [similar or different] often occurring over the span of years.) In 1920, psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (1856–1926), the founder of contemporary scientific psychiatry, observed a \"great number\" of cases that had characteristics of both groups of psychoses that he originally posited were two distinct and separate illnesses, dementia praecox (now called schizophrenia) and manic depressive insanity (now called bipolar disorders [plural since there are more than one type of bipolar disorder] and recurrent depression).[67]\nKraepelin acknowledged that \"there are many overlaps in this area,\" that is, the area between schizophrenia and mood disorders.[69] In 1959, psychiatrist Kurt Schneider (1887–1967) began to further refine conceptualizations of the different forms that schizoaffective disorders can take since he observed \"concurrent and sequential types\".[67] (The concurrent type of illness he referred to is a longitudinal course of illness with episodes of mood disorder and psychosis occurring predominantly at the same time [now called psychotic mood disorders or affective psychosis]; while his sequential type refers to a longitudinal course predominantly marked by alternating mood and psychotic episodes.)[68] Schneider described schizoaffective disorders as \"cases in-between\" the traditional Kraepelinian dichotomy of schizophrenia and mood disorders.[68]\nThe historical clinical observation that schizoaffective disorder is an overlap of schizophrenia and mood disorders is explained by genes for both illnesses being present in individuals with schizoaffective disorder; specifically, recent research shows that schizophrenia and mood disorders share common genes and polygenic variations.[70][71][72][73]\nSchizoaffective disorder was included as a subtype of schizophrenia in DSM-I and DSM-II, though research showed a schizophrenic cluster of symptoms in individuals with a family history of mood disorders whose illness course, other symptoms and treatment outcome were otherwise more akin to bipolar disorder than to schizophrenia. DSM-III placed schizoaffective disorder in \"Psychotic Disorders Not Otherwise Specified\" before being formally recognized in DSM-III-R.[74] DSM-III-R included its own diagnostic criteria as well as the subtypes, bipolar and depressive.[74] In DSM-IV, published in 1994, schizoaffective disorders belonged to the category \"Other Psychotic Disorders\" and included almost the same criteria and the same subtypes of illness as DSM-III-R, with the addition of mixed bipolar symptomatology.[75]\nDSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR (published in 2000) criteria for schizoaffective disorder were poorly defined and poorly operationalized.[6] These ambiguous and unreliable criteria lasted 19 years and led clinicians to significantly overuse the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis.[6] Patients commonly diagnosed with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder showed a clinical picture at time of diagnosis that appeared different from schizophrenia or psychotic mood disorders using DSM-IV criteria, but who as a group, were longitudinally determined to have outcomes indistinguishable from those with mood disorders with or without psychotic features.[6] A poor prognosis was assumed to apply to these patients by most clinicians, and this poor prognosis was harmful to many patients.[6][76] The poor prognosis for DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder was not based on patient outcomes research, but was caused by poorly defined criteria interacting with clinical tradition and belief; clinician enculturation with unscientific assumptions from the diagnosis' history (discussed above), including the invalid Kraepelinian dichotomy;[48][51] and by clinicians being unfamiliar with the scientific limitations of the diagnostic and classification system.[6]\nEvidence is lacking about schizoaffective disorder's (likely multiple) causes and mechanisms (knowing these leads to specific and consistently effective treatments), and about how exactly mood episodes and psychosis are related (knowing this may lead to a simpler, clearer, and more usable behavioral definition of the disorder; as well as a better diagnostic system).[41][51] Whether schizoaffective disorder is a variant of schizophrenia (as in DSM-5 and ICD-10 classification systems), a variant of bipolar disorder, or part of a dimensional continuum between psychotic depression, bipolar disorders and schizophrenia is currently being investigated.[51]\nResearch into the assessment and treatment of schizoaffective disorder will rely less on DSM and ICD criteria as time progresses, and more on the dimensional Research Domain Criteria currently being developed by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The Research Domain Criteria initiative, led by Bruce Cuthbert of NIMH, is the inspiration for the Roadmap for Mental Health Research in Europe (ROAMER).[51][77][78] The purpose of the Research Domain Criteria initiative is to address the marked variability and overlap within and among the disorder categories, and to foster development of more effective assessment and treatment for each individual patient.[51][77][78] Over the coming decades, advances resulting from the Research Domain Criteria in the U.S. and ROAMER in Europe will be incorporated into future versions of the DSM and ICD, with the hope of eventually leading to personalized mental health of greater diagnostic accuracy and with more targeted and useful treatments, including biomedical, psychosocial, and possibly preventive approaches.[77]\n^ Bowers, Malcolm, Jr (2004).

In which, it is caused by on-going lung disease or a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-COPD which includes bronchitis. This should be used along with medications like bronchodilators (salmeterol or ipratropium) to treat COPD. Controlling the symptoms of breathing problems can decrease time lost from work or school.\nHow does Daliresp (Roflumilast) work?\nThe active ingredient of Daliresp is Roflumilast. It is a PDE4 inhibitor that blocks the action of PDE4. PDE4 is an enzyme that plays a critical part in some pathways in the body. It includes the pathways that affect the inflammatory response and the immune system. It also impacts smooth muscle relaxation in the body, including smooth muscle relaxation in the airways.

It is generally taken for diseases like neurocysticercosis (affecting the brain, muscles and other tissues), giardiasis (intestinal infection), hydatid disease, pinworm disease (intestinal infection), ascariasis (gastrointestinal infection), filariasis (affecting the lymph nodes and vessels) and others. The medicine falls under the group of drugs known as anthelmintics, which expels the parasitic worms either by stunning them or killing them without causing notable damage to the host body. It is available in the form of tablets and taken.\nBefore you start this medication, you must inform your doctor if you have any of the following health conditions:\nA low blood count (low platelet, white cell or red cell count)\nIf you are a breast-feeding mother\nIn case you are allergic to Aldex 400 MG Tablet, or any other medicines or food\nIn case you forget to take a dose of this medication, you can take it as soon as you remember it. Do not take two doses together just because you missed one. It should also be kept in mind not to stop your medicines before the prescribed time, even if you think you are feeling better. Apart from that, you must consult your child's paediatrician before using this tablet to treat your child's condition.\nAldex is a benzimidazole carbamate that has a broad spectrum of anthelmintic activity, including against Ascaris lumbricoides, Enterobius vermicularis, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Echinococcus spp. and T. solium cysticerci. 1,2,64–67 The drug has also been used to treat eosinophilic enterocolitis caused by Ancylostoma caninum, Capillaria philippinensis, cutaneous and visceral larva migrans, C. sinensis, Gnathostoma spinigerum, Oesophagostomum bifurcum and Trichostrongylus spp. It is also used in combination with diethylcarbamazine or ivermectin for mass treatment of lymphatic filariasis (Brugia malayi and Wuchereria bancrofti). 68 Additionally, it has variable efficacy in the treatment of microsporidiosis caused by Encephalitozoon hellem, E. cuniculi, E. intestinalis, E. bieneusi and Vittaforma corneae. 69 Aldex has some activity against G. lamblia. 38\nThe mechanism of action is similar to that of mebendazole with blockade of parasite microtubule assembly. Aldex is poorly soluble in water and should be taken with a fatty meal to enhance absorption.\nSingle doses of Aldex are generally well tolerated; abdominal discomfort, diarrhea or migration of Ascaris into the mouth and nose occur infrequently. Prolonged, high-dose treatment can be associated with reversible aminotransferase elevations, bone marrow suppression and alopecia.\nALBENZA binds to the colchicine-sensitive site of β-tubulin inhibiting their polymerization into microtubules. The decrease in microtubules in the intestinal cells of the parasites decreases their absorptive function, especially the uptake of glucose by the adult and larval forms of the parasites, and also depletes glycogen storage. Insufficient glucose results in insufficient energy for the production of adenosine trisphosphate (ATP) and the parasite eventually dies.\nParasitic resistance to Aldex is caused by changes in amino acids that result in changes in the β-tubulin protein. This causes reduced binding of the drug to β-tubulin.\nIn the specified treatment indications Aldex appears to be active against the larval forms of the following organisms:\nWhat Other Drugs Interact with Aldex?\nAldex has no known severe interactions with other drugs.\nAldex has no known serious interactions with other drugs.\nModerate interactions of Aldex include:\nMinor interactions of Aldex include:\nHow should I take Aldex?\nIn a young child (or anyone who is unable to swallow a whole Aldex tablet), the tablet should be crushed or chewed and swallowed with a full glass of water.\nYou may be given other medicines to prevent certain side effects of Aldex, or certain effects that can result when the parasites die within your body.\nTell your doctor if you have any changes in weight. Aldex doses are based on weight.\nUse this medicine for the full prescribed length of time. Your symptoms may improve before the infection is completely cleared. Skipping doses may also increase your risk of further infection that is resistant to antibiotics. Aldex will not treat a viral infection such as the flu or a common cold.\nAldex can weaken your immune system. Your blood may need to be tested often. You will need frequent blood tests (every 2 weeks) to check your liver function.\nThe investigators of a recent trial evaluated the effectiveness of combined therapy of praziquantel and Aldex (50 mg/kg/day and 15 mg/kg/day, respectively) in comparison to two different doses of just Aldex (15 or 22.5 mg/kg/day) in the treatment of neurocysticercosis . Praziquantel is also an anthelmintic that works by causing strong contractions within the parasite that causes paralysis and eventual dislodgment . The purpose of the study was to determine if combining the two different mechanisms would be more effective than single agent therapy. It has also been noted in the past that praziquantel increases the serum concentration of the active metabolite of Aldex . The side effects listed by the study were described as seizures, headache, pregnancy, drug-induced hepatitis, and \"other\" which included spontaneous abortion, urinary tract infection, motor vehicle accident, dizziness, fever, vomiting, and intracranial hypertension. While all of the side effect groups except for the drug-induced hepatitis were more common in the increased dose of Aldex or the combination therapy than in the standard Aldex therapy, the study found that the increased prevalence of adverse effects was not statistically significant. Currently, there is not a listed interaction between Aldex and praziquantel with the active ingredients of birth control.\nGENERIC NAME(S): Aldex\nOTHER NAME(S): Aldex Tablet\nEach white to off-white, circular, biconvex, bevel-edged film coated, TILTAB tablet is debossed with \"ap\" and \"550\" and contains 200 mg of Aldex.\nBottles of 2 Tablets NDC 52054-550-22 Bottles of 28 Tablets NDC 52054-550-28\nWhat other drugs will affect Aldex?\nOther drugs may interact with Aldex, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal products. Tell each of your health care providers about all medicines you use now and any medicine you start or stop using.\nALBENZA (Aldex) is an orally administered anthelmintic drug. Chemically, it is methyl 5-(propylthio)-2-benzim >12 H 15 N 3 O 2 S. Its molecular weight is 265.34. It has the following chemical structure:\nAldex disease interactions\nThere are 4 disease interactions with Aldex which include:\nWhat are the uses for Aldex?\nAldex is FDA approved for the treatment of the following parasitic infections:\nHydatid Disease Aldex is used for the treatment of cystic hydatid disease of the liver, lung, and peritoneum, caused by dog tapeworm (Echinococcus granulosus) larvae.\nNeurocysticercosis Aldex is used to treat parenchymal neurocysticercosis due to active lesion caused by pork tapeworm (Taenia solium) larvae.\nOff-label use Aldex is also effective in treating infections caused by other parasites including Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm), Trichinella spiralis (pork worm), Trichuris trichiura (whipworm), Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm), Strongyloides stercoralis (threadworm), Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm), Ancylostoma duodenale (hookworm), and Necator americanus (hookworm).\nWhat Is Aldex and How Does It Work?\nAldex is a prescription drug used to treat certain tapeworm infections (such as neurocysticercosis and hydatid disease).\nAldex is available under the following different brand names: Albenza.\nDosages of Aldex:\nNeurocysticercosis (Taenia solium Tapeworm)\nOver 60 kg: 400 mg orally twice daily for 8-30 days\nUnder 60 kg: 15 mg/kg/day divided twice daily orally for 8-30 days; not to exceed 800 mg/day\nHydatid (Echinococcus Tapeworm)\nOver 60 kg: 400 mg orally twice daily for 28 days, then 14 drug-free days for 3 cycles\nUnder 60 kg: 15 mg/kg/day divided twice daily orally, no more than 800 mg/day for 28 days than 14 drug-free days for 3 cycles\nHealing Your Body And Improving Your Performance With Sports Massage Therapy - Choosing A Better Salon\nAssess why you would like a massage and rule out other medical problems\nMassage therapy is an effective form of pain relief that can keep your body feeling fresh and ready for physical activity. But if you are trying to use massage therapy to treat more serious injuries, it might not be effective until you get to the root of the problem. Go to a sports doctor to rule out fractures or muscle tears that could be causing the pain that you feel. After you have seen the doctor and they rule out anything more serious, you can start looking for a sports massage clinic that can offer you a session.\nFind a sports medicine massage clinic and ask about the options\nThe kind of sports massage that you get can either be preventative or a form of rehabilitation. If it is preventative, you might seek a deep massage before or after physical activity. You can help your muscles heat up and cool down so that you can always be limber and ready for activity. If you need the massage to rehabilitate an injury, you probably will need to bring your medical records and get the massage therapist up to speed on what you hurt and how you hurt it. These massages are generally great at rehabbing joint problems or muscle pulls. A sports massage is especially helpful if you have a nagging injury, like a pulled hamstring.\nMany sports massage clinics double as physical therapy centers. If this is the case, they might also apply an ultrasound to your muscles to stimulate a response and loosen it up. Sports massage clinics can also give you treatments like acupuncture, acupressure, and introduce you to other forms of massage therapy. Some other helpful forms of massage therapy include Swedish massage, shiatsu massage, and hot stone massage therapy.\nYour body will thank you and your athletic performance can improve when you go in for a sports massage.

Given the nature of paediatric emergency medicine, we are likely to need global collaboration to answer these research questions.\"\nAssociate Professor Craig said there have been concerns raised regarding research waste, either through poor design, lack of publication, or incomplete reporting.\n\"Crucially, it has been estimated that around half of all research studies do not take into account lessons and results from previous related research,\" Associate Professor Craig said.\n\"An understanding of the research priorities for practicing clinicians allows us to ensure that these topics are systematically examined to identify gaps in evidence, and/or gaps in knowledge translation, prior to the design of future trials.\"\n\"Interestingly, we also identified a number of areas where practicing clinicians identified research questions which had already been answered by existing studies – either by clinical trials or systematic reviews. This highlights the importance of translating research knowledge into clinical practice which remains a challenge for acute paediatric care.\"\nLabels: Latest news, predict, simon craig\nAim: To attract outstanding national and international early- to mid-career post-doctoral researchers to expand Australian research capacity in synthetic biology.\nFunding can be used to support the Fellow's salary and on-costs, reasonable operating costs, travel, equipment, and other expenses directly related to the Future Fellow's research.

Only 50% of patients can tolerate the \"gold\" standard treatment, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Upper airway surgery is a critical alternative treatment with the potential to cure OSA but only does so in approximately 25% of patients. Similarly, surgical weight loss can resolve OSA, but its resolution cannot be predicted by their starting weight or post-intervention weight loss. The key problem is that current clinical tools cannot accurately predict treatment response for either approach. My research aims to use novel OSA physiological traits to predict treatment response to these interventions (upper airway surgery and surgical weight loss).\nSupervisors: A/Professor Garun Hamilton, Dr Bradley Edwards, Dr Simon Joosten, A/Professor Darren Mansfield\nLabels: ai-ming wong, Lectures & Seminars\nEdmond Kwan's PhD confirmation, \"Androgen receptor variants: predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and overcoming treatment resistance in advanced prostate cancer\", 30 January\nAll staff and students are invited to Edmond Kwan's PhD confirmation\n30 January, 11.30am - 1pm, Level 7 boardroom, TRF\nAndrogen receptor variants: predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and overcoming treatment resistance in advanced prostate cancer\nThe last several years has seen the approval of multiple new therapies for advanced prostate cancer, particularly targeting the androgen receptor (AR) axis.

You may have heard that old adage a few times, but it is as true today as it has always been.\nThe food you consume is digested and becomes your blood. Your blood then nourishes , repairs and rebuilds your entire body.\nYour body makes new red blood cells every 120 days and those cells go on to create new skin cells, bone cells, hair cells etc.\nOne of the most important foods to eat is avocados. Avocados are rich in monounsaturated fatty acids. These are the good fats that the body needs. They also contain glutathione which is an anti-cancer substance. Eating avocados also protects the heart to help prevent heart disease.\nContrary to popular belief avocados do not make you fat. Yes they do contain fats, but fats which actually mop up the bad fats in the body and can even help in the reduction of high blood pressure as well as weight loss! I can see this when I look at someone's live blood under the microscope. Someone who has been consuming avocados on a daily basis will have a very clear plasma fluid surrounding the red blood cells.\nThe absolute key to good health is the quality of the red blood cells you create. The quality of your red blood cells will determine your weight, the quality of your skin, hair and even your energy levels!\nOne of my clients Fiona Harvey who included avocados in her health regime had this to say:\n\"The last few years had been very stressful. The family had a lot of grief to deal with and I became my father's carer during his illness, travelling from London to Birmingham on a weekly basis. With this, and holding down a full-time job, I found I was not eating well and did not get sufficient rest or exercise.\n\"Within the last year I suffered an outbreak of eczema which I had never experienced before and my scalp was extremely dry. I became prone to yeast infections and my blood pressure rocketed. I was always tired, restless, had regular migraines, suffered with constipation, joint pains and was moody.\n\"My weight was up and down and my last attempt to lose weight with Weight Watchers was disappointing. I went up to 12 stone 9, the heaviest I had ever been.\nBEFORE AND AFTER: Fiona, left, felt tired and her blood cells (below left image) were in a poor state. Fiona, right, lost weight, felt better and her blood cells (below right image) were in a much improved state\n\"Not being able to reduce my blood pressure after nine months was a concern. My GP advised I would need to take tablets; I was determined this was not a route I wanted to go down and needed to get my health in hand. I know all to well the dangers of high blood pressure and diabetes as these are two conditions that are in my family medical history.\n\"I had read about Errol Denton in The Voice and looked up Live Blood Analysis on the internet. Having done a few months research I decided I would book myself in for a test.\n\"I had my first test on March 26, 2009 and was totally shocked of what was found in my blood. My red blood cells were sticking together forming a long worm shape rather than healthy round shapes. They were full of sugar and yeast which explained the exhaustion, skin problems and eczema. I was able to see mould forming and parasites moving freely around my blood. My white blood cells were no better; they were small and not being produced sufficiently to fight any infections. Errol explained how what was in my blood contributed to the illnesses I was experiencing and how I could make changes to improve my wellbeing.\n\"Within the first week of starting the programme I lost 4lbs and steadily continued to lose weight over the next three months. My skin improved and my hair and scalp looked healthier. Plus my energy levels increased. I noticed when I walked short distances I was no longer short of breath.\n\"After three months of alkalizing, eating non-acidic foods and drinking plenty of green drinks, I lost 1 stone 2lbs by time I had my retest on June 25.\nErrol was pleased with my retest which showed a 30 percent improvement of my blood. After having regular monthly checks on my blood pressure, it had dropped to normal and tablets were not mentioned again!\n\"Family and friends always comment on how well I look and that I have a 'glow' about me. With a further 7lbs weight loss I have also been able to maintain my weight at just less than 11 stones.\n\"I read food labels more closely now and have learned to say \"no thank you\" to tempting foods.\n\"The key to successful wellbeing is to make the change and take one step at a time. I still have a way to go to see greater improvements and will continue to alkalize to further improve my wellbeing.\"\nAlmost everyone wants to lose weight after the festive season and they either rush off to join a gym or some special diet club usually getting very disappointing results. The key to achieving great permanent results is to clean your blood through a lifestyle change and not faddy diets. Rethinking how and what you eat is the key to true health at a cellular level.\n* Errol Denton is a nutritional microscopist live blood analyst focussed primarily on the creation of healthy red blood cells as this is the key to perfect health.

In particular they seemed to be aware of the damage that smoking caused to the tongue or jaw or the lip and even the teeth, but were strangely reluctant to change their habits. This is of particular concern to the oral and maxillofacial surgeons, who are launching a massive awareness campaign as a part of the Mouth Cancer Awareness Week. Surgeons will visit schools and educate adolescents about the effects of smoking on the mouth and in particular its relation to oral cancer. \"Smoking among adolescents is rising. Kids want graphic images and powerful images, they like to know that if they do this we will get that,\" said Iain Hutchison, a maxillo facial surgeon based at Barts and the Royal London, Hospital and a member of Saving Faces, the Facial Surgery Research Foundation. \"We know it is much more difficult to quit smoking than to never start, so this is the place to start making sure these children don't ever smoke.\" He says that children are very impressed with the graphic images and go home and tell their parents about it. \"By educating the kids we are also educating their parents about smoking and mouth cancer,\" Hutchinson points out. It is estimated that about 4,300 new cases of oral cancer occur in the UK every year and a majority of them are linked to smoking. Research conducted by dental plan provider Denplan shows that smoking and drinking increases the risk of oral cancer by 30 times \"Symptoms of mouth cancer vary widely in look and feel, making early self-detection difficult. That's why regular visits to the dentist remain crucial for detecting the disease because dentists are trained to spot the signs,\" said Dental advisor Dr Henry Clover.\n<< Low turnover by Diabetics for free annual checkup\nDoctors unhappy with insurer's ratings proposal >>\nTongue Abnormalities Health Hazards of Smoking Smoking And Cancer Smoking And Tobacco Cancer and Homeopathy Diet Lifestyle and Heart Disease Bubbles and Brews - Alcohol Facts Cancer Facts Cancer Smoking\nHome Abused substances Biocodone Abuse\nBiocodone, a brand name for the opiate narcotic hydrocodone, is prescribed by doctors to treat people suffering from around-the-clock severe-pain.\nHydrocodone functions by changing the way your central nervous system reacts to pain signals, and when taken in higher than recommended doses, produces a sense of euphoria and sedation that can lead to near-immediate psychological dependence for some. For this reason, you must always take Biocodone exactly as directed by your doctor.\nIf you or someone you love is addicted to Biocodone, call 800 774 5796 now, and let us connect you with the right substance abuse treatment for your needs.\nUnderstanding Biocodone Abuse\nBiocodone is a brand name for hydrocodone, a semi-synthetic opiate derived from the opium poppy. It is in the same family of drugs as oxycodone, codeine, morphine and heroin, and just like any other opiate, Biocodone works by binding to opiate receptors and blocking pain signals.\nThis medication can also produce a sense of cheerfulness, well-being and peace due to a release of the neurotransmitter dopamine—an effect which can protect the body from shock due to surgery or injury. When you take a higher than recommended dose of Biocodone, you experience euphoria and extreme relaxation resulting from an abnormal rush of the same neurotransmitter. Some people become hooked on this experience from their first use.\nSigns and Symptoms of Biocodone Abuse\nSigns and symptoms of an opiate addiction can be physical, behavioral, and psychological. A primary sign of addiction is regularly taking more medication than is clinically recommended.\nOther signs and symptoms of Biocodone abuse may include:\nDrowsiness is a common sign of Bicodone abuse.\ncontinually seeking new prescriptions\npretending to lose prescriptions\nIf you or someone you love is addicted to Biocodone, please call 800 774 5796 now. We can help.\nDangers of Biocodone Abuse\nIf you continue to abuse Biocodone, you will develop a tolerance that will force you to raise your dosage to potentially unsafe amounts. Among other problems, high doses of hydrocodone can cause respiratory depression.\nAccording to the National Institute for Drug Abuse: \"depressed respiration can affect the amount of oxygen that reaches the brain, a condition called hypoxia. Hypoxia can have short- and long-term psychological and neurological effects, including coma and permanent brain damage.\"\nYou may not be able to recognize when this damage is happening to you, which is why it is crucial to seek treatment for a drug problem as soon as possible.\nEven when taken according to your doctor's advice, Biocodone may cause adverse effects. MedlinePlus explains that these include:\nSome side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these, seek emergency medical treatment:\nIf you or someone you love is suffering due to an addiction to Biocodone, call 800 774 5796 now, and let our treatment advisors help.\nWho Abuses Biocodone?\nThere is no one type of person who abuses opiate drugs like Biocodone. You may begin inadvertently, perhaps by mistakenly taking extra medication to make up for a missed dose. Then, you may have enjoyed the resulting rush of euphoria, pain relief, and blissful calm so much that you felt compelled to repeat the experience.\nYour Biocodone abuse may be a sign that you suffer from an undiagnosed mental illness such as depression or an anxiety disorder. You could be abusing opiates to self-medicate. This may be effective in the short-term, but over time, the side effects and withdrawal symptoms caused by the drug will only exacerbate any emotional problems, while adding to your burden with new somatic complaints.\ndysthymia (an inability to feel pleasure)\nBiocodone Addiction\nDon't struggle with Bicodone addiction alone. Get treatment help today!\nAnyone, from any walk of life, has the potential to become addicted to Biocodone. When used appropriately, the medicine can keep you from suffering unnecessarily during illness or recovery from surgery or injury. Untreated pain can inhibit healing, sometimes leading to emotional problems as well as health complications from stress.\nBut overuse and abuse of Biocodone will lead to an addiction that will take over your life, limit your options and threaten your well-being.\nAm I Addicted to Biocodone?\nIf you fear that you are addicted to Biocodone, read and honestly answer the questions below:\nDo I abuse Biocodone to escape from negative feelings or conflicts that I don't want to face?\nAm I obsessed with maintaining a supply of drugs?\nHave I done things I'm ashamed of, or that scare me, in order to obtain drugs?\nDo I abuse Biocodone every day?\nHave friends or family members mentioned that they are worried about my drug use?\nWhen I try to cut down or quit using, do I experience withdrawal symptoms such as those listed above?\nDo I feel like I can't have fun, be normal, or complete everyday tasks without Biocodone?\nDo I need more and more Biocodone each time I abuse the drug in order to feel its effects?\nHave I experienced any major problems as a result of my drug use, such as a breakup, job loss, car accident, family problems, financial problems, or getting arrested?\nDespite knowing Biocodone is bad for me, do I feel unable to stop using on my own?\nIf you answered yes to one or more of these questions, you may be addicted to Biocodone and in need of professional substance abuse treatment. Call 800 774 5796 now, and let our advisors connect you to the best options for your needs.\nBiocodone Addiction Treatment\nIf you feel like your drug use is out of control, then you need help. The sooner you get treatment, the better your chances will be of making a full recovery and maintaining your sobriety for the long-term.\nOpiate abuse can have a long-lasting effect on brain function, impairing your judgement, cognition, and ability to cope with stress. Waiting to seek addiction treatment will only augment the damage, and make repairing it more of an undertaking.\nThe first step towards healing is to rid your body of addictive substances. It is not a good idea to abruptly stop taking Biocodone. You should taper your dosage slowly with the guidance of medical professionals who know how you can detox with a maximum of safety and a minimum of discomfort.\nChemical dependence treatment programs offer many different options that you can combine as needed to create a customized approach to recovery. These options include:\nLevels of care that vary depending on need– You may respond best to a fully immersive, inpatient residential program where your life revolves around the recovery experience. Or you may benefit from an outpatient program that allows you to incorporate recovery into your everyday life without having to remove yourself from it.\nDifferent treatment environments– You may be drawn to a more urban program that allows you to use resources available in the city as a part of the therapeutic process. Or you may prefer a program in a rural setting, where natural surroundings and activities can be used for their healing capabilities.\nIndividual, group or family counseling– No matter what type of program you choose, you will certainly engage in talk therapy to work through issues, improve communication, address past trauma, and lay the groundwork for relapse prevention after discharge.\nSupport Groups– The philosophies behind AA's 12-step program are not only beneficial in and of themselves, but attending meetings can be a wonderful way to support a sober lifestyle. They are a resource that will be available to you everywhere, every day. They also help remind you that you are not alone in your journey.\nHolistic Therapies– Recovery isn't just about healing the mind. You must also heal your body and spirit to truly overcome addiction in a way that lasts. Therapies such as mindfulness training, yoga, and music therapy can address your healing from a whole-person perspective.\nYou don't have to live with the suffering that Biocodone addiction causes you and your loved ones.\nCall 800 774 5796 today. Our advisors will direct you to affordable, effective substance abuse treatment that will help you change your life.\nSecurity | Leading Boards\nData privacy guaranteed!\nThe security of information is our priority #1\nLeading Boards servers' are located in Canada and France and they are certified by international security standards.

It often is an indication that something is wrong. Each individual is the best judge of his or her own pain. Pain is an unpleasant feeling that is conveyed to the brain by sensory neurons. The discomfort signals actual or potential injury to the body. Perception gives information on the pain's location, intensity, and something about its nature.\nThe various conscious and unconscious responses to both sensation and perception, including the emotional response, add further definition to the overall concept of pain.Feelings of pain can range from mild and occasional to severe and constant. Pain falls in to two categories: Acute and Chronic\nAcute pain begins suddenly and is usually sharp in quality. It serves as a warning of disease or a threat to the body. Acute pain may be caused by many events or circumstances, including:\nAcute pain may be mild and last just a moment, or it may be severe and last for weeks or months. In most cases, acute pain does not last longer than six months and it disappears when the underlying cause of pain has been treated or has healed. Unrelieved acute pain, however, may lead to chronic pain.\nChronic pain refers to pain that persists after an injury heals.It is estimated that one in three people in the United States will experience chronic pain at some point in their lives. Of these people, approximately 50 million are either partially or completely disabled. Common chronic pain complaints include:\nWhether Acute pain or Chronic pain there is a very likely a treatment that can relieve your pain. While your pain or discomfort may be located in any of the areas listed below the actual dianosis may be the same and treatment will depend on these criteria.\nWhen you consult with the doctor be sure an have all relavent history available, such as, any documentation, xrays and medcation prescriptions, and if you have had any previous attempts at a surgical or non-surgical pain management therapy.

The nerve roots are branches of the spinal cord that carry signals to the rest of the body at each level along the spine. This term comes from a combination of the Latin word \"radix,\" which means the roots of a tree, and the Latin word \"pathos,\" which means a disease. This disease is often caused by direct pressure from a herniated disc or degenerative changes in the lumbar spine that cause irritation and inflammation of the nerve roots.\nRadiculopathy usually creates a pattern of pain and numbness that is felt in your arms or your legs in the area of skin supplied by sensory fibers of the nerve root, and weakness in the muscles that are also supplied by the same nerve root. The number of roots that are involved can vary, from one to several, and it can also affect both sides of the body at the same time.\nThe most common symptom of lumbar radiculopathy is sciatica. This is a pain that radiates from your back into your buttocks, and down your legs to the feet. Sensory symptoms are more common than motor symptoms, and muscle weakness is usually a sign that the nerve compression is more severe.\nThe quality and type of pain can vary, from dull, aching, and difficult to localized, sharp, burning, and easy to pinpoint. Radiculopathy can create hypersensitivity to touch as well as numbness in the area of skin that is supplied by the nerve root. Symptoms such as numbness and tingling, and especially weakness in your leg muscles in the presence of back pain are warning signs that your problem may be more serious and you should see a doctor.\nThere are several different causes of radiculopathy, but the correct diagnosis of the cause of your symptoms begins with a complete physical examination of the entire body, with special emphasis on the back and lower extremities. Your doctor will examine your back for flexibility, range of motion, and the presence of certain signs that suggest that a particular nerve root is being affected. This often involves testing the strength of your muscles and checking your reflexes to make sure that they are still working normally. You will often be asked to fill out a diagram that asks you where your symptoms of pain, numbness, tingling and weakness are occurring.\nA routine set of x-rays is also usually ordered when a patient with back pain goes to see a doctor. An MRI scan or a CT scan (CAT scan) can also be part of the evaluation for the causes of radiculopathy. An MRI scan is very useful for determining where the nerve roots are being compressed because this type of a scan is designed to show the details of soft-tissue structures, like nerves and discs. A CT scan is often used to evaluate the bony anatomy in the lumbar spine, which can show how much space is available for the nerve roots. The nerve roots exit the spinal canal through a bony tunnel called the neuroforamen, and it is at this point that the nerve roots are especially vulnerable to compression.\nThe doctor will be able to discuss with you what your diagnosis means in terms of treatment options. For most people who do not have evidence of nerve root compression with muscle weakness, the first line of therapy includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, rest, and physical therapy. A soft back brace or lumbar support is often prescribed in order to allow the back to have a chance to rest.\nSurgery for radiculopathy is offered as an early option for people who have evidence of muscle weakness that is being caused by nerve root compression. This is because muscle weakness is a definite sign that the nerves are being injured (more seriously than when pain is the only symptom) and relieving the pressure on the nerves can be more of a priority. In most other situations, surgery is offered only after physical therapy, rest, and medications have failed to adequately relieve the symptoms of pain, numbness and weakness over a significant period of time.\nFailed back syndrome or post-laminectomy syndrome is a condition characterized by persistent pain following back surgeries. Failed back syndrome (FBS), also called \"failed back surgery syndrome\" (FBSS), refers to chronic back and/or leg pain that occurs after back (spinal) surgery. It is characterized as a chronic pain syndrome. Multiple factors can contribute to the onset or development of FBS.\nContributing factors include but are not limited to residual or recurrent disc herniation, persistent post-operative pressure on a spinal nerve, altered joint mobility, joint hypermobility with instability, scar tissue (fibrosis), depression, anxiety, sleeplessness and spinal muscular deconditioning. An individual may be predisposed to the development of FBS due to systemic disorders such as diabetes, autoimmune disease and peripheral blood vessels (vascular) disease. Smoking is a risk for poor recovery.\nCommon symptoms associated with FBS include diffuse, dull and aching pain involving the back and/or legs. Abnormal sensibility may include sharp, pricking, and stabbing pain in the extremities. The term “post-laminectomy syndrome” is used by some doctors to indicate the same condition as failed back syndrome.\nThe treatments of post-laminectomy syndrome include physical therapy, minor nerve blocks, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), behavioral medicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications, membrane stabilizers, antidepressants, spinal cord stimulation, and intracathecal morphine pump. Use of epidural steroid injections may be minimally helpful in some cases. The targeted anatomic use of a potent anti-inflammatory anti-TNF therapeutics is being investigated.\nEpidural fibrosis refers to the formation of scar tissue near the nerve root following back surgery. Symptoms of epidural fibrosis typically occur within 6-12 weeks after surgery, and can get better with time (usually within 3 months). If symptoms do not improve, the spine surgery is unlikely to have been successful.\nsymptoms associated with epidural fibrosis appear at 6 to 12 weeks after back surgery. This is often preceded by an initial period of pain relief, after which the patient slowly develops recurrent leg pain. Sometimes, the improvement occurs immediately after back surgery, but occasionally the nerve damage from the original pathology makes the nerve heal more slowly.\nIn general, if the patient experiences continued leg pain directly after spine surgery, but starts to improve over the next three months, he or she should continue to improve. If, however, there is no improvement by three months postoperatively, the spine surgery is unlikely to have been successful, and the patient will continue to have back pain or leg pain.\nStretching the nerve root while the body is healing (scarring in) after back surgery can help limit epidural fibrosis from becoming a clinical problem. Most scar tissue forms within the first 6 to 12 weeks after back surgery. The theory is that if the nerve is kept mobile while the wound heals, the nerve will not be bound down by adhesions and the scar tissue that develops should not become a problem. Routinely pumping the ankle while stretching the hamstrings will move the nerve across the operative disc site.\nDegenerative disc disease (DDD) is part of the natural process of growing older. Unfortunately, as we age, our intervertebral discs lose their flexibility, elasticity, and shock absorbing characteristics. The ligaments that surround the disc called the annulus fibrosis, become brittle and they are more easily torn. At the same time, the soft gel-like center of the disc, called the nucleus pulposus, starts to dry out and shrink. The combination of damage to the intervertebral discs, the development of bone spurs, and a gradual thickening of the ligaments that support the spine can all contribute to degenerative arthritis of the lumbar spine.\nThe most common symptom of degenerative disc disease is back pain. When DDD causes compression of the nerve roots, the pain often radiates down the legs or into the feet, and may be associated with numbness and tingling. In severe cases of lumbar DDD, where there is evidence of nerve root compression, individuals may experience symptoms of sciatica and back pain, and sometimes even lower extremity weakness.\nThe diagnosis of degenerative disc disease begins with a physical examination of the body, with special attention paid to the back and lower extremities.Your doctor will examine your back for flexibility, range of motion, and the presence of certain signs that suggest that your nerve roots are being affected by degenerative changes in your back. This often involves testing the strength of your muscles and your reflexes to make sure that they are still working normally.You will often be asked to fill out a diagram that asks you where your symptoms of pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness are occurring. x-rays or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be ordered.\nMost people with lumbar degenerative disc disease find relief through nonsurgical options, such as exercise or physical therapy. But for those who need surgery, spinal fusion is a proven choice. And for those who choose spinal fusion, there's a therapy that can eliminate a second surgery.\nCausalgia is a rare pain syndrome related to partial peripheral nerve injuries. The peripheral nervous system encompasses nerves that extend from the central nervous system of the brain and spinal cord to serve limbs and organs. Severe cases are called major causalgia. Minor causalgia describes less severe forms, similar to reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD). RSD includes muscular and joint pain symptoms, and changes in bone density.\nCausalgia is usually caused by brachial plexus injuries, involving nerves that run from the neck to the arm. The disruption of neural signals causes pain and increased release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which causes vascular symptoms.\nSymptoms usually involve burning pain prominent in the hand or foot within 24 hours of injury. Almost any sensory stimulation worsens the pain. Vascular changes include either increased or decreased blood flow due to dilation or constriction of blood vessels. Other symptoms include dry, scaly skin; still joints; tapering fingers; ridged nails; long, coarse hair or hair loss; and changes in sweating.\nDiagnosis entails a thorough medical history and physical examination. Physical exams can be difficult to perform due to pain.\nIntrathecal Drug Delivery for Chronic Pain Intrathecal Drug Delivery (IDD) directs prescribed pain medications to the spinal cord—affecting primarily the presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors in the gelatinosa of the posterior horn of the spinal cord.Intrathecal Drug Delivery (IDD) directs prescribed pain medications to the spinal cord—affecting primarily the presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors in the gelatinosa of the posterior horn of the spinal cord. Pain medications delivered directly to the intrathecal space are particularly effective because they don't circulate systemically to reach the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As a result, effective pain relief may be achieved using much smaller doses than are used in orally administered analgesics (for example, approximately 1/300 of an oral morphine dose),1,2 thus reducing the frequency of side effects. Spinal Cord Stimulation Spinal cord stimulation alleviates pain by electrically activating pain-inhibiting neuronal circuits in the dorsal horn and inducing a tingling sensation (paresthesia) that masks the sensations of pain. As an intervention for chronic back and/or leg pain, spinal cord stimulation can be an effective alternative or adjunct treatment to other interventions that have failed to manage pain on their own. Spinal cord stimulation alleviates pain by electrically activating pain-inhibiting neuronal circuits in the dorsal horn and inducing a tingling sensation (paresthesia) that masks the sensations of pain.\nArachnoiditis is a neuropathic disease caused by the inflammation of the arachnoid, one of the membranes that surround and protect the nerves of the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. The arachnoid can become severely inflamed because of adverse reactions to chemicals, blood, and/or steroids, infection from bacteria or viruses, as the result of direct injury to the spine, chronic compression of spinal nerves, or complications from spinal surgery or other invasive spinal procedures such as epidural steroid injections.\nLumbar patches (also known as blood patches), which are often useful in relieving painful headaches associated with spinal taps and epidural anesthesia, have been found to be significant potential causative agents in some cases and may warrant avoidance of the procedure where possible. Multiple blood patches may amplify the probability of contracting arachnoiditis. It is also noteworthy that blood has been found to be a significant inflammatory agent in the nervous system. Inflammation can sometimes lead to the formation of scar tissue and adhesions which can cause the spinal nerves to \"stick\" together.\nThe swollen arachnoid can lead to a host of painful and debilitating symptoms. Chronic pain is common, including neuralgia. Numbness and tingling of the extremities is frequent in patients due to spinal cord involvement. Bowel, bladder, and sexual functioning can be affected if the lower part of the spinal cord is affected. While arachnoiditis has no consistent pattern of symptoms, it frequently affects the nerves that supply the legs and lower back.\nMany sufferers find themselves unable to sit for long (or even short) periods of time, often due to severe pain as well as efferent neurological symptoms, such as difficulties controlling limbs. This can be particularly problematic for those patients who exhibit difficulties standing or walking for protracted periods, as wheelchairs are not helpful for this group. Some sufferers benefit from relatively new inventions, such as the Segway or the less expensive Stand'n'Ride alternative. Standing wheelchairs are also available, although often quite expensive and limited compared to these alternatives. However, standing endurance and vibration tolerance should be taken into account before a motorized assistance device is selected.\nIt is critical for patients to realize that the symptoms of arachnoiditis are highly varied and are not all experienced by all sufferers. Consequently, while typically significantly life-altering, the outcome, especially with physical therapy, appropriate psychotherapy, and medication, may be better than many patients fear upon receiving the diagnosis.\nArachnoiditis is a chronic disorder and there is no known cure at this time. Pain management techniques may provide some relief to patients. Prognosis may be hard to determine because of the lack of correlation between the beginning of the disease and the start of symptoms. For many, arachnoiditis is a disabling disease that causes chronic pain and neurological deficits. It may also lead to other spinal cord conditions, such as syringomyelia. Arachnoiditis is a difficult condition to treat. Treatment is limited to alleviation of pain and other symptoms. Surgical intervention generally has a poor outcome and only provides temporary relief. Steroid injections administered either intrathecally or epidurally have been linked as a cause of the disease, therefore they are generally discouraged as a treatment and may even worsen the condition.\nCancer pain can result from the cancer itself. Cancer can cause pain by growing into or destroying tissue near the cancer. Cancer pain can come from the primary cancer itself — where the cancer started — or from other areas in the body where the cancer has spread (metastases). As a tumor grows, it may put pressure on nerves, bones or other organs, causing pain.\nCancer pain may not just be from the physical effect of the cancer on a region of the body, but also due to chemicals that the cancer may secrete in the region of the tumor. Treatment of the cancer can help the pain in these situations. Pain begins with sensory cells, or neurons, called nociceptors. A pain message is transmitted along these neurons to the spinal cord. In the spinal cord, chemical messengers called neurotransmitters are released and act on other “ascending” neurons. Eventually, these ascending neurons carry the signal to the brain where it is perceived as pain. Oral medications may relieve pain but often cause serious side effects that dramatically affect the life of a patient and his or her family. Side effects include sedation, confusion, fatigue, constipation, nausea and vomiting.\nA drug pump (also called an intrathecal drug delivery system) sends pain medication directly to the fluid around the spinal cord, providing pain relief with a small fraction of the medication needed if taken orally.\nBT missed the pricing shakeup for portable digital radio this faces tough competition from The Pure Evoke deck.\nYou know the story; you’ve found an internet radio station online based in California. Trouble is you can’t get it on any other device than your desktop machine when connected to broadband. Rather than set up your PC on a trolley and wheel it around the house, BT has come up with the one solution: The BT Voyager Digital Media Player.\nThe unit and idea is a simple one, design and create a radio that will happily sit in any kitchen and give it wireless capabilities. The unit comes in two parts; a base station that plugs into your desktop PC via a USB connection and the radio itself.\nInstallation and setup was simple and you won’t need to be running a wireless network or have any technical savvy to understand how it all works. The radio itself has been designed to be as consumer-friendly as possible and looks like a portable radio. Powered by either a power pack or eight C cell batteries, the unit also includes two large speakers, a large backlit LCD display enabling users to see information such as radio station names and CD track information.\nThe Digital Media Player allows you to stream media from your PC as long as you are within the signal area - roughly 50m - and you can stream either internet radio, MP3s or CDs (as long the CD is in your CD drive in your Desktop PC). The unit also includes a terrestrial radio tuner if you just want to listen to Radio Four and even has an alarm clock if you feel like you might want to be woken up by it.\nThe BT Voyager Digital Media Player is the first of a wave of devices that are planning to make use of the growing number of households that have a broadband connection. Where other manufacturers, such as Netgear have gone for a more hi-fi separates style, BT has gone for the more traditional trannie radio approach and overall it has worked.\nNothing's perfect and you will have to have the base unit (ie the desktop PC) switched on all the time for this to work, but then the majority of devices that uses broadband require the same. If you really can't live without your MP3 music or favourite internet radio station elsewhere in the house then this is certainly one good way of sharing the love. Good but slightly pricey for most.\nLung disease - Green Blog - NYTimes.com\nPosts tagged with LUNG DISEASE\nJun 15, 2012Jun 15, 2012\tE.P.A. Casts New Soot Standard as Easily MetBy Leslie Kaufman\tAs anticipated, the Environmental Protection Agency announced on Friday that it was proposing to update and tighten national air quality standards for fine-particle soot.\nSomewhat surprisingly, however, the agency said that by the time these new standards were fully in force in 2020, all but six counties in the United States would be in compliance with them as a result of steps taken to abide by other tightened rules. Getty ImagesHighway 60 in Riverside County, Calif., an area that faces notable air pollution challenges.\nThe E.P.A. also predicted that the costs of compliance would be relatively modest. Depending on the final standard adopted, it said, the costs of compliance could be as low as $2.9 million, with an anticipated $88 million a year in benefits, or range as high as $69 million, an investment that would yield $5.9 billion in benefits. The cost-benefit analysis shows that investing in pollution control yields returns, the agency said. Soot, or the microscopic particulates emitted by car tailpipes, diesel engines and industry smokestacks, among other sources, has been found to cause thousands of deaths from lung and heart disease.\nConsidering the hostile stance of many Congressional Republicans on the issue of environmental regulation, and the fact that President Obama is running for re-election this year, it is not surprising that the E.P.A. would emphasize the potential economic benefits in its announcement. Still, its analysis seemed somewhat perplexing; the agency's current count indicates that 162 counties and 17 partial counties exceed the maximum fine-particulate levels that are being proposed.\nDec 2, 2011Dec 2, 2011\tNew Pollution Rules for Boilers and IncineratorsBy John M. Broder\tThe Environmental Protection Agency on Friday released its much-delayed and oft-revised air quality regulations for industrial boilers and incinerators. The proposal is a modest refashioning of boiler rules introduced earlier this year, which were themselves a major revision of a 2010 plan by the agency that drew heavy political and industry opposition.\nCategory T - post on this topic\nTips - T chart cover letter samples | PDF, Writing Service, Example T chart cover letter samples Psychology of Aging article-awg--9-25-09-FINAL Running head: EFFECTS OF AGE ON DETECTION OF EMOTION 1 Effects of Age on Detection of Emotional Information Christina.\nTips - T mobile business plan requirements | PDF, Writing Service, Example T mobile business plan requirements T-Mobile Holiday Offer | T-Mobile.com 4.3 What Are The Voice And Data Plan Requirements ? 4.4 How Does AT T Calculate My Data Usage/Billing? . 4.15 AT T.\nTips - T.s. eliot research paper | PDF, Writing Service, Example T.s. eliot research paper A Study of Indian English Poetry - International Journal .

Famotidine is N'(aminosulfonyl)-3-[[[2-[(diaminomethylene)amino]-4-thiazolyl]methyl]thio]propanimidamide. The molecular formula of famotidine is CHNOS and its molecular weight is 337.45. Its structural formula is:\nFamotidine is a competitive inhibitor of histamine Hreceptors. The primary clinically important pharmacologic activity of famotidine is inhibition of gastric secretion. Both the acid concentration and volume of gastric secretion are suppressed by famotidine, while changes in pepsin secretion are proportional to volume output.\nSystemic effects of famotidine in the CNS, cardiovascular, respiratory or endocrine systems were not noted in clinical pharmacology studies. Also, no antiandrogenic effects were noted. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS.)Serum hormone levels, including prolactin, cortisol, thyroxine (T), and testosterone, were not altered after treatment with famotidine.\n4. Short-term treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Famotidine is indicated for short-term treatment of patients with symptoms of GERD (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY IN ADULTS, Clinical Studies). Famotidine is also indicated for the short-term treatment of esophagitis due to GERD including erosive or ulcerative disease diagnosed by endoscopy (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY IN ADULTS, Clinical Studies ).\n5. Treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions (e. g., Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome, multiple endocrine adenomas ) (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY IN ADULTS, Clinical Studies ).\nSince CNS adverse effects have been reported in patients with moderate and severe renal insufficiency, longer intervals between doses or lower doses may need to be used in patients with moderate (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min ) or severe (creatinine clearance <10 mL/min) renal insufficiency to adjust for the longer elimination half-life of famotidine. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY IN ADULTS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).\nTwo pharmacokinetic studies in pediatric patients < 1 year of age (N=48) demonstrated that clearance of famotidine in patients >3 months to 1 year of age is similar to that seen in older pediatric patients (1-15 years of age) and adults. In contrast, pediatric patients 0-3 months of age had famotidine clearance values that were 2 to 4 fold less than those in older pediatric patients and adults. These studies also show that the mean bioavailability in pediatric patients <1 year of age after oral dosing is similar to older pediatric patients and adults. Pharmacodynamic data in pediatric patients 0-3 months of age suggest that the duration of acid suppression is longer compared with older pediatric patients, consistent with the longer famotidine half-life in pediatric patients 0-3 months of age. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY IN PEDIATRIC PATIENTS, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics .)\nIn a double-blind, randomized, treatment-withdrawal study, 35 pediatric patients <1 year of age who were diagnosed as having gastroesophageal reflux disease were treated for up to 4 weeks with famotidine oral suspension (0.5 mg/kg/dose or 1 mg/kg/dose). Although an intravenous famotidine formulation was available, no patients were treated with intravenous famotidine in this study. Also, caregivers were instructed to provide conservative treatment including thickened feedings. Enrolled patients were diagnosed primarily by history of vomiting (spitting up) and irritability (fussiness). The famotidine dosing regimen was once daily for patients < 3 months of age and twice daily for patients ≥ 3 months of age. After 4 weeks of treatment, patients were randomly withdrawn from the treatment and followed an additional 4 weeks for adverse events and symptomatology. Patients were evaluated for vomiting (spitting up), irritability (fussiness) and global assessments of improvement. The study patients ranged in age at entry from 1.3 to 10.5 months (mean 5.6 ± 2.9 months), 57% were female, 91% were white and 6% were black. Most patients (27/35) continued into the treatment-withdrawal phase of the study. Two patients discontinued famotidine due to adverse events. Most patients improved during the initial treatment phase of the study. Results of the treatment-withdrawal phase were difficult to interpret because of small numbers of patients. Of the 35 patients enrolled in the study, agitation was observed in 5 patients on famotidine that resolved when the medication was discontinued; agitation was not observed in patients on placebo (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Pediatric Patients ).\nThe adverse reactions in overdose cases are similar to the adverse reactions encountered in normal clinical experience (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Oral doses of up to 640 mg/day have been given to adult patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions with no serious adverse effects. In the event of overdosage, treatment should be symptomatic and supportive. Unabsorbed material should be removed from the gastrointestinal tract, the patient should be monitored, and supportive therapy should be employed.\nGastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)The recommended oral dosage for treatment of adult patients with symptoms of GERD is 20 mg b.i.d. for up to 6 weeks. The recommended oral dosage for the treatment of adult patients with esophagitis including erosions and ulcerations and accompanying symptoms due to GERD is 20 or 40 mg b.i.d. for up to 12 weeks (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY IN ADULTS, Clinical Studies ).\nFamotidine tablets, USP 20 mg are yellow, film coated, round shaped tablet with 'C' on one side and plain on other side.\nASCO Reading Room | Reshma Jagsi, MD, on Acute Toxicity From Breast Radiotherapy | MedPage Today\nReshma Jagsi, MD, on Acute Toxicity From Breast Radiotherapy\n– Study identified patient characteristics linked with more post-treatment pain\nby Jeff Minerd , Contributing Writer, MedPage Today\tApril 6, 2021\nUnderstanding acute toxicities after whole-breast radiotherapy is important to inform patients, guide treatment decisions, and target supportive care. Researchers led by Reshma Jagsi, MD, of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, therefore conducted a prospective study of approximately 8,700 patients, surveyed within 7 days of radiation treatment.\nSome of the key findings of their study, reported in the Journal of Clinical Oncology:\nCompared with hypofractionation, conventional fractionation was associated with more breast pain (46% vs 29% of patients), severe fatigue (27% vs 19%), and other side effects\nRegardless of the type of radiation therapy, certain characteristics were significantly associated with breast pain. These included younger age, higher body mass index, Black race, smoking, and larger breast volume (P<0.001 for all)\n\"Of particular concern, race-related differences in breast pain and bother existed despite controlling for multiple other factors, including age, body habitus, comorbidities, and treatment characteristics,\" Jagsi and co-authors wrote. \"Additional research is needed to understand the factors that drive these and other differences detected in the current study, to target those that are potentially modifiable.\"\nIn the following interview, Jagsi, who is deputy chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology and director of the Center for Bioethics and Social Sciences in Medicine, elaborated on the team's findings as well as other issues raised by the study.\nWhat fears or concerns do patients tend to have about radiation-related toxicity, and how can clinicians address these?\nJagsi: Prior work has shown that patients often have many concerns before radiation treatment, and many tell us that treatment was not as bad as they feared. Radiation is a scary concept -- in most of daily life, it's something we are taught to fear and avoid. That's why it is so important to have clear communication with patients about what risks are and are not expected from treatment.\nWhat groups of patients might benefit from more supportive care during radiation therapy, according to your study?\nJagsi: We found that toxicity depended on the radiation treatment approach, including dose fractionation, boost treatment, and regional nodal irradiation, and also varied by body habitus, age, race, smoking behavior, and comorbidities. This can help us as radiation oncologists to identify higher-risk subgroups who might benefit from more intensive monitoring for the need for supportive care interventions.\nYour study found that Black and other non-white patients reported significantly more breast pain after radiotherapy, despite controlling for multiple other factors. What are the potential reasons for this?\nJagsi: We observed higher rates of toxicity in certain groups, including patients who were Black or had other non-white race, even after controlling for racial differences in other risk factors. As discussed in the paper, whether the increased rates of toxicity reported in these patient groups reflect inherent biologic or socially constructed socioeconomic differences of the patients themselves or differences in provider and/or patient behavior merits additional attention.\nPrior studies have suggested that there may be meaningful race-related differences in genes involved in inflammation, wound repair, and fibrotic response to radiation. However, we must acknowledge that race is a social construct, and it is also important to consider explanations relating to differences in resources or differences in patient or provider behaviors.\nFor example, other studies have shown providers to be less sensitive to the pain of Black patients and less likely to prescribe pain medication to them. One recent study revealed that false beliefs about biological differences between Blacks and whites (e.g., that the skin of Black people is thicker than that of white people) were endorsed not only by white laypersons but also by one half of a sample of white medical students and residents.\nFinally, are you undertaking or planning any additional research in this area?\nJagsi: Yes, we presented a study in December at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium virtual meeting delving into whether some of this may reflect differences in provider recognition of symptoms.\nThat work suggests that not only are Black patients more likely to report severe symptoms, but that among all patients reporting severe symptoms, Black patients are less likely to have those symptoms recognized by their treating providers.\nThe study was supported by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and the Blue Care Network of Michigan.\nThe Best Christmas Gift! |\nby sanaesuzuki in Blog, Cancer, Sanae's Story 5703♥ 3 Likes Like\nStarting with my fever, my body was showing the sign of cancer already in January, but I did not find out right away.\nSince I had ovarian cancer in 1993 it was always in the back of my mind that it may come back.\nBut I was taking care of myself to the best of my ability through macrobiotics, which I have been practicing since I got ovarian cancer.\nAfter 24 years of good health I believe that I would not have cancer anymore so I was very shocked, sad and felt very strained feelings when I was diagnosed with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Primary non-Hodgkin of Liver Stage Ⅳ (I got this cancer because of Hepatitis C from the blood transfusion I received after my car accident in 2001) in early spring.\nI thought I was able to recover again with macrobiotics and holistic way, but I did not feel I had a good connection and support with my first oncologist. Cancer grew very quickly and I felt that I was dying.\nI felt that I had to found a new oncologist and two of my friends helped me to find Dr. Mead very quickly.\nWhen I went to see Dr. Mead for the first time on May 17th, she told me that 90% of my liver was taking over by cancer. She told me that I had only weeks to live.\nThere was no choice except taking chemotherapy in order for me to save my life so I did 6 rounds of chemotherapy as I was told.\nIt was not what I imagine to heal myself and it was one of hardest challenges I had to take in my life.\nI kept my macrobiotics practice and I did my best during the treatments.\nWriting helps my mind to be clear and also heals my soul so I have been writing my blogs about how I faced chemotherapy with side effects and to live. If you missed them, please find time to read.\nEmotional Side Effects of Chemotherapy and How to Help Them\nAdopting a Puppy Brought Cheerfulness to Cancer Household\nAfter sixth rounds of chemotherapy I was hoping to receive good news before Thanksgiving, but the PET Scan shows in an activity of Lymphoma in my liver, so I had to do another biopsy in mid-December.\nMost biopsies are not so painful, but a liver biopsy can cause pain and breathing difficulties after the procedure.\nWhen I did biopsy early this year I had so much pain and was not able to breathe normally. I also could hardly move, so I stayed in bed for a week, and the pain lasted over three weeks.\nThankfully, the biopsy results were good, this was the best Christmas gift and to start New Year.\nI need to monitor continuously and have to take PET Scan on February 1, 2018. But this was the best news this year!\nI credit all of you for your continued support and well wishes.\nHere are some photos that I took over the holidays.\nEric Santa Claus with his assistants: Mai Mai Lani (new kitty), Nalu and Happy.\nGetting Christmas gifts: left to right – Happy, Oro, Leo, Nalu, Bubu and Lumi.\nTin Tin caught cold and coughing\nP.S.

In Texas, a CRNA is required to have an order for anesthesia or anesthesia related services from a physician. The physician's order delegates the ordering of drugs and devices to the CRNA. The legal basis for this practice for CRNAs is established by the Board Rule 221.15 – 221.16. For physicians, the Texas Medical Board has established rule 193.13, which describes how physicians delegate the ordering of drugs and devices to nurse anesthetists.\nThe BON includes a note in the APRN application specifically addressing this:\n\"A note to CRNAs: The BON does not require that you have prescriptive authority to write orders for drugs and devices for the purpose of administering anesthesia or anesthesia-related services.\"\nThere is a legal distinction between ordering a medication for administration in a healthcare setting and prescribing a medication for patients to self-administer at home. When a CRNA writes an order for a dangerous drug or controlled substance in the recovery room, the CRNA is ordering the administration of the medication to the patient. Prescriptive authority is not required for CRNAs to order medications. In addition, CRNAs are not required to possess a Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) registration number when ordering controlled substances within Texas licensed hospitals or ambulatory surgery centers.\nWhen a CRNA issues a prescription for a medication that is dispensed to the patient by a pharmacist, it is considered prescribing. For practices in which a CRNA needs prescriptive authority, the process begins with applying for prescriptive authority and obtaining a prescriptive authority number from the BON. The CRNA and delegating physician must also ensure that the requirements of the Texas Medical Board have been met, including the filing of a properly executed Prescriptive Authority Agreement.\nMay, 2013 | Berry for Us\nEvery pregnant mom will gain some weight.
