Yet research shows that many hospitals have restrictive visiting policies that give families limited access to the bedsides of loved ones during a hospital stay.\nThrough this project, two nonprofit organizations—New Yorkers for Patient and Family Empowerment and the Institute for Patient- and Family-Centered Care—will work together with a group of New York City hospitals to change visiting policies from those that restrict family presence and participation to policies that are more welcoming and recognize that families are essential members of the care team.\nInvitations will be sent to the leaders of all New York City hospitals, and up to 20 hospitals will be selected to participate—with teams of four to five staff from different disciplinary areas. Participating hospitals will assess their current policies and practices, participate in training sessions, receive tested toolkits and guides to help them change policies and practices, and attend an international conference (held in New York City) on the topic. The project's products will include a report on a comparative survey of hospitals' posted \"visiting policies\" on their websites to measure change that has occurred over the time of the project, both for participating and non-participating hospitals.\nUHF Outpatient Antibiotic Stewardship Initiative ($310,180)\nInterfaith Medical Center ($30,000)\nMediSys Health Network ($60,000)\nMemorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center ($15,000)\nMount Sinai Health System ($35,180)\nNewYork-Presbyterian/Queens ($60,000)\nNorthwell Health ($45,000)\nWyckoff Heights Medical Center ($30,000)\nAntibiotic misuse and overuse has emerged as an important health care quality and patient safety issue. Studies show that up to 50 percent of antibiotic prescribing is inappropriate, resulting in increased rates of serious infections and contributing to the spread of antibiotic resistance.\nHealth care institutions can rely on antibiotic stewardship programs to optimize antibiotic prescribing to improve patient care, reduce costs, and slow the spread of antibiotic resistance. Although antibiotic stewardship practices have predominantly been prioritized within inpatient hospital settings, there is a critical need to consider their applicability in outpatient settings, which is the source of 262.5 million courses of antibiotic prescriptions per year, and where formal stewardship programs are much less common.\nThrough this grant initiative, United Hospital Fund will work with a group of 24 outpatient sites from 8 hospitals and health systems to better understand the primary factors that drive prescribing practices, and to identify appropriate interventions for the sites to test and implement to improve the appropriateness of antibiotic prescribing. UHF will work with participants to analyze prescribing practices for a sub-set of adult patients with acute respiratory infections, as this is a major condition in which antibiotics are misused. The practices will use a set of structured data collection tools, to be developed by UHF and an advisory group (composed of infectious disease physicians, pharmacists, and outpatient clinicians) that will be formed as part of the initiative. UHF will engage two key infectious disease physicians, from two of the participating hospitals, to provide clinical expertise to help shape this effort.\nData & Society Research Institute ($70,000)\nMedicare Rights Center ($75,305)\nTo enhance organizations' capacity to promote the interests of consumers within new health system transformation models in New York State, and help consumers become better informed and active participants in shaping new models. Medicare Rights Center will assess the care landscape, including payment and delivery system innovations and next steps for education and policy.\nIn New York State and across the country, the way health care is paid for and delivered to patients and consumers is changing. And these changes affect the relationships and dynamics between patients, providers, and payers in ways that are complex.\nThis project aims to improve the capacity of the Medicare Rights Center and other consumer–oriented stakeholders to promote the rights and needs of consumers—particularly older consumers with disabilities, the Medicare population—to become better informed and active participants in shaping new models.\nThe Medicare Rights Center will convene a workgroup to develop criteria for assessing New York's health system transformation landscape and will develop plans for educating consumers about—and engaging them in—new models. The project team will also work with policymakers to help ensure that new models are responsive to consumer needs. The project will culminate in a report on New York's Medicare-related health system transformation landscape.\nRSNA: Healthcare reform means an uphill battle for radiology\nNovember 29, 2011 | Trimed Staff | Healthcare Economics & Policy\nCHICAGO—The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) will likely mean severe cuts to imaging, a reduction in the advancement of imaging technology and pressure on radiologists to work for hospitals under an accountable care organization (ACO) model, according to a presentation on Nov. 28 at the 97th Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting of the Radiology Society of North America (RSNA).\nBernard F. King, Jr., MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., explained that the PPACA came when it did as a result of rising costs, a rising number of uninsured people and a perception that insurance practices needed reform. In regards to cutting costs, government officials believed they could make cuts to imaging services without angering their constituents. In contrast, cuts to primary care payments are likely upset constituents, according to King.\nOne change that has already occurred is the coding for abdomen and pelvis CT scans. As of Jan. 1, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) combined the codes for these services, which severely cut reimbursement, as part of a mandate that says services performed together at least 75 percent of the time must use one CPT code.\nKing said that similar reductions will be likely as reform continues to be implemented. The PPACA gives the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services the ability to identify codes that are misvalued, which will target codes characterized by fast growth and new technologies.\n\"The bottom line is what CMS will view as misvalued codes is code word for imaging and the high reimbursement for imaging that's perceived by the government,\" said King.\nReform will also mean the spread of the ACO model, and with it a pressure for radiologists to be employed by hospitals. The problem for imaging under an ACO is that the system of incentives is focused on the primary care doctor and leaves radiology out of the mix, said King. Shared savings will go to primary care physicians and the ability to manage image services will be weakened, as will technological innovation.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will play a major role as it has announced it will rule on the PPACA in its current term, hearing arguments in spring 2012 with a decision likely in June 2012. King explained that the court will focus on four key points:\nThe constitutionality of the individual insurance mandate;\nThe constitutionality of the whole law should the individual mandate be severed;\nThe ability of the court to even hear the case under a law which bars courts from hearing cases on taxes before they are collected; and\nThe ability of the federal government to force states to expand their share of Medicaid costs at the risk of funding cuts if they refuse.\nShould the law survive, King said a major focus of reform will be on comparative effectiveness research, and this is where imaging will have an opportunity to show that it can be a tool to save money.\n\"We just have to focus our efforts with the RSNA and with the American College of Radiology on looking at comparative effectiveness research and proving to those bean counters, to the government especially, and to insurance companies that imaging can actually reduce healthcare costs,\" said King.\nReview of successful osh benchmarki... by European Agency f... 2385 views\nPan-European opinion poll on occupa... by European Agency f... 179975 views\nPan-European poll on occupational s... by European Agency f... 87293 views\nPlan de contingencia by Carlos Méndez 190 views\nPacote Q3 Completo by Eduardo Abbas 171 views\nA presentation by Dr Christa Sedlatschek, Director of EU-OSHA\nConference: Active Ageing: \"From research to action oriented policies\" Florence 14 March 2017\nLUCIANO DAVID , rls banca del Piemonte at uilca\n1.

Chlamydia in women often remains symptomless and it can go undetected for a long time. Which symptoms does female chlamydia cause and how can you diagnose it? Find out how to spot the infection early on and stay safe.\nOrder Chlamydia Test Kit\nContents\nWhich symptoms are common in women?\nWhat does chlamydia discharge in women look like?\nI am experiencing bleeding between periods - Do I have chlamydia?\nChlamydia and cervicitis\nCan chlamydia cause PID symptoms?\nHow quickly does chlamydia turn into PID?\nBleeding during sex - a sign of chlamydia?\nDoes chlamydia increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy?\nChlamydia during pregnancy - what are the risks?\nWhich symptoms are common in women?\nThe most common symptoms of chlamydia in women are:\nunusual vaginal discharge\npain or burning sensation during urination\nfrequent urination\nThese symptoms typically appear within 1 - 3 weeks after you have been infected by a partner. However, the majority of women who catch the infection never experience any symptoms. Often, they are unaware that they are infected. As a result, chlamydia continues to be a very common sexually transmitted infection, especially amongst young men and women.\nDon’t rely on symptoms to tell whether or not you have chlamydia. If you have had unprotected sex with a partner who has not recently tested negative you should get tested. You can either visit a local GUM clinic or order your test kit online.\nBack to top\nBack to top\nWhat does chlamydia discharge in women look like?\nThe most well-known chlamydia symptom is unusual discharge. It is normal to experience discharge from the vagina on a regular basis but if you notice any changes, you ought to get tested.\nDischarge caused by chlamydia does not always look the same, so any change you notice could be a sign of infection. If your discharge changes in smell, colour or quantity you should always consult a doctor.\nBack to top\nBack to top\nI am experiencing bleeding between periods - Do I have chlamydia?\nIf a chlamydia infection progresses and causes cervicitis or pelvic inflammatory disease, it can also cause bleeding between periods. If you experience spotting or bleeding between periods and have not recently started or changed your hormonal contraceptive, this could be a sign of an underlying problem like chlamydia.\nBack to top\nBack to top\nChlamydia and cervicitis\nCervicitis is a common condition, which can have various causes. Cervicitis is an inflammation of the cervix and it can be caused by an allergic reaction, injury or irritation. It can also be caused by chlamydia.\nTypical symptoms of cervicitis are:\nunusual bleeding\nbleeding after sex\ngrey or pale yellow discharge\npain during sex\nproblems with urination\npain during urination\nfrequent urination\nIf cervicitis is not treated, it can develop into pelvic inflammatory disease.\nBack to top\nBack to top\nCan chlamydia cause PID symptoms?\nIf you have chlamydia for a long time, you can develop pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) as a result. This happens, when the chlamydia infection spreads and affects your womb, fallopian tubes or ovaries.\nPID can cause the following symptoms:\nabdominal pain\npain during sex\npain during urination\nbleeding between periods\nunusually painful or heavy periods\nunusual discharge (may be green or yellow)\nPID can also sometimes cause severe symptoms, such as severe pain in the abdomen, fever, nausea and vomiting.\nIn many cases, PID does not cause any obvious symptoms. However, this doesn’t mean that it is harmless. PID can cause irreparable damage to your reproductive organs and make you infertile if it is not treated.\nYou can prevent getting PID as a result of an STI by getting tested for sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia and gonorrhea on a regular basis and by using a condom every time you have sex.\nPID is treated with antibiotics, which are either taken by mouth or given by injection. The course usually lasts for 14 days.\nBack to top\nBack to top\nHow quickly does chlamydia turn into PID?\nThere is no general rule of thumb to explain how long it takes for chlamydia to turn into PID. Many women who have chlamydia never develop PID, whereas others might do so within a few weeks or months after getting infected. You should see a doctor as soon as you notice any symptoms of PID and get checked for chlamydia if you believe you could have it.\nBack to top\nBack to top\nBleeding during sex - a sign of chlamydia?\nBleeding during sex can be a sign of cervicitis. As chlamydia is a risk factor for cervicitis, it could indicate that you have chlamydia. However, there could be other reasons why you may experience unusual bleeding, for example injury or a side effect from your contraceptive pill.\nBack to top\nBack to top\nDoes chlamydia increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy?\nAs PID can cause scarring to your fallopian tubes, it also increases your risk of an ectopic pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy occurs, when an egg develops outside the womb. It is a very dangerous condition which needs to be diagnosed and treated as early as possible. As chlamydia increases your risk of PID, it also increases your risk of an ectopic pregnancy.\nBack to top\nBack to top\nChlamydia during pregnancy - what are the risks?\nIn the UK, all pregnant women are invited to a routine chlamydia test at the beginning of their pregnancy. Chlamydia screening is highly recommended for women who are pregnant or planning for a baby, as chlamydia can be passed to the infant during childbirth.\nAlthough the infection is relatively harmless in adults, it can have life-threatening consequences for babies as it can cause pneumonia. It is also possible for the baby to develop chlamydial conjunctivitis (an eye infection) as a result of being exposed to the bacteria during birth. Chlamydial conjunctivitis is one of the main preventable causes for blindness in children.\nIf you are diagnosed with chlamydia during pregnancy, you will be given an antibiotic treatment to clear the infection before the birth and protect your baby.\nBack to top\nBack to top\nOrder Chlamydia Test Kit\n×\nSign up to our newsletter!\nSign up to receive personalised discounts, vouchers, news and more in our monthly newsletter.\nEmail Address\nSign Up\nI confirm I am over 16 years old\nBy clicking Sign up you agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions\n×\nThank you\nfor signing up!\nYou’ll be added to our mailing list once you confirm your email.

The Nipah virus is a zoonotic disease that is naturally transmitted from vertebrate animals to humans, while human-to-human transmission has also been documented.\nFirst identified among pig farmers in Malaysia, the disease also surfaced in Siliguri, West Bengal, in 2001 and again in 2007. Historically, the virus had largely remained in a cluster, meaning it was mostly confined to an area, and affected those that came in close contact with the patients, the experts said. The latest outbreak in India has so far affected mainly four districts of Kerala -- Kozhikode, and its neighbouring districts of Malappuram, Kannur and Wayanad. People in other states do not have much to worry unless they need to travel to the affected areas or come in contact with someone who has contracted the virus.\n\"All the previous such epidemics were reported to be in clusters and historical evidence shows no simultaneous outbreaks,\" said Vidya Menon, Clinical Professor at the Department of Medicine, Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kochi.\n\"So people who come in close contact of the patients are usually the ones who acquire the disease. If that contact group increases or travel to other places, the disease is likely to spread,\" Menon said.\nNipah virus can be transmitted by infected pigs, or by fruit bats, through their secretions of saliva, urine or faeces. The other mode of transmission is human to human, through body secretions and respiratory secretions. Contracting Nipah causes an upper respiratory infection, leading to fever, body ache, breathlessness and cough.\n\"There is no need to panic, but if you have symptoms similar to this or if you have visited the state recently, visit a doctor at the earliest,\" said Suranjit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant - Internal Medicine at the Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi. Depending upon the exposure to the virus, it can also proceed to further complication like Encephalitis -- inflammation of the brain. This can result in mental confusions and deteriorate to coma.\n\"The progression is very severe. While the incubation period is long for some, on an average in 90 percent of cases, the disease manifests itself within two weeks of exposure to the virus,\" Menon said.\n\"Those infected should be isolated for at least 10-15 days, till the virulence of the virus settles and our immune system also starts fighting,\" said Vikas Maurya, Head of Department - Pulmonolgy, Fortis Hospital - Shalimar Bagh, New Delhi.\nThere is no real treatment but supportive care is given to the affected patients, which means treating the symptoms differently.\n\"For example, people suffering from fever are treated for it, for those with breathlessness support is provided to them with artificial ventilators, and for those with seizures or convulsions anti-epileptic drugs are given as a support to the brain,\" Menon said.\nThe Kerala government has now recommended using Ribavarin -- an anti-viral -- as a life-saving measure. It is not a proven treatment, but it is approved because of a few studies that have proved the anti-virals benefits.\n\"Beginning Thursday, the Kerala government has recommended using Ribavarin -- an anti-viral -- but only in proven cases,\" Menon said.\nLauding the efforts by the government officials, Menon said, \"The situation seems to be under control, the state public health department has done a remarkable job in containing the disease so far. There is no need to panic.\" Besides maintaining hygiene, the experts suggested avoiding eating fruits that have any paw marks on it or is contaminated. Food should be properly cooked before consuming. Restricting mobility to and fro to the affected areas can curtail the virus up to some extent, Chatterjee suggested. \"If you are travelling to the infected area, use a general mask. While coughing close your mouth with a handkerchief or a cough on your sleeve, wash hands properly, and maintain hygiene,\" Menon said.\nTags: Cautions Kerala disease Nipah Virus Nipah virus causes Nipah virus contagious Nipah virus treatment\nGoogle Year in Search 2018: Statue of Unity, Karnataka Election Results Among Top 5 Searched News Items in India\nOur top priority is the health and well-being of our students, families, and staff. We continue to be highly attentive to the requirements and guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), regional and local authorities including the Washington State Department of Health (DOH) and Public Health – Seattle and King County, as well as the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI). As you are aware, there is no way to fully guard against transmission, but with strict adherence to the following health and safety measures, we hope to keep risk to a minimum.\nAll students, faculty, staff, and visitors are required to wear a face covering at all times, indoors and outdoors, while on campus. This protocol is in accordance with the requirements of the DOH and OSPI. Refer to the Washington State Department of Health Guidance on Cloth Face Coverings for more information. If an individual does not have a face mask, one will be provided by the School.\nStudents and adults will wash hands frequently including when they arrive at school, before meals or snacks, after outside time, after going to the bathroom, after nose blowing or sneezing, and before leaving to go home. Hand washing stations will be installed at school entrances. If soap and water are not readily available, hand sanitizer may be used.\nStudents, faculty, staff, and visitors will practice physical distancing as much as possible in classrooms and other common areas, and during activities. Floor markings will designate 6 foot spaces and direct traffic flow in halls throughout the school building. Seating/desks in classrooms will face the same direction and be 6 feet apart. Plexiglass barriers have been installed in areas where it is difficult to maintain proper physical distancing. Students' and teachers' ability to social distance will depend on students’ ages and developmental and physical abilities.\nAshwagandha has been used for centuries in Ayurveda and for good reason. This wonderful apoptogenic root helps our bodies combat the ill effects of stress and regulates cortisol. This means that however stress manifests in your body, Ashwagandha helps to bring your body back into equilibrium.\nFor example, if stress is giving you insomnia, Ashwagandha helps you sleep. If stress is making you feel anxious, Ashwagandha helps you to feel calm. If stress is causing you to be more prone to infections, Ashwagandha strengthens your immunity.\nA popular herb from the mint family, Lemon Balm is an aromatic ingredient that is often used in teas and tinctures to increase calmness and alertness all while relieving mental stress.\nLemon balm also has the added benefit of being rich in antioxidants, helping to keep our bodies protected from free radicals, which our bodies are more exposed to when we’re stressed.\nPassion Flower, a beautiful purple and white wild flower, has been used in traditional and modern natural medicine alike, as a solution to calm nerves, treat anxiety and depression, and cure insomnia.\nUsually taken in the form of teas, tinctures, infusions, and extracts, Passionflower promotes relaxation and helps the body to prepare for a good nights sleep thanks to its gentle sedative effect.\nA Hidden Truth: Hospital Faucets Are Often Home to Slime and Biofilm – Global Health News Wire\nSinks and faucets tested at the University of Michigan Health System revealed slime and biofilm.\nResearchers at the University of Michigan Health System assessed eight different designs across four intensive care units to determine how dirty sinks and faucets really are. They found that a shallow depth of the sink bowl enabled potentially contaminated water to splash onto patient care items, healthcare worker hands, and into patient care spaces – at times at a distance of more than four feet from the sink itself.\n\"The inside of faucets where you can't clean were much dirtier than expected,\" said study author Kristen VanderElzen, MPH, CIC. \"Potentially hazardous germs in and around sinks present a quandary for infection preventionists, since having accessible sinks for hand washing is so integral to everything we promote. Acting on the information we found, we have undertaken a comprehensive faucet replacement program across our hospital.\"\n\"As we learn more about the often stealthy ways in which germs can spread inside healthcare facilities, infection preventionists play an increasingly important role in healthcare facility design – including in the selection of sink and faucet fixtures – as this study illustrates,\" said 2019 APIC President Karen Hoffmann, RN, MS, CIC, FSHEA, FAPIC. \"Because the healthcare environment can serve as a source of resistant organisms capable of causing dangerous infections, an organization's infection prevention and control program must ensure that measures are in place to reduce the risk of transmission from environmental sources and monitor compliance with those measures.\"\nBack2News - Latest News and Updates from all over India, World Wide In India, diabetes is fast becoming a disease of the poor\ndiabetes : Two years ago, 49-year-old Ramachandran, a resident of Kolkata, underwent a regular medical check-up and was told that he was pre-diabetic. Even though he changed his diet to control his blood sugar levels, after a year he found that he was losing weight unusually and that his vision was blurring.\n\"I was also feeling a burning sensation while passing urine,\" he said. \"I found minor cuts and bruises in my private parts.\"\nIn September last year, Ramachandran was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Ramachandran is an engineer from a middle-income background. It is among people like Ramachandran that diabetes is on the rise.\nDiabetes has long been a disease of affluence but small regional studies in recent years have indicated that, in India, it has been slowly spreading among lower income groups. However, an ongoing national survey of diabetes called the Indian Council of Medical Research – India Diabetes or simply ICMR-INDIAB study finds that many more people from middle-income and poor communities are becoming diabetic.\nThe ICMR-INDIAB study is the largest national representative of diabetes and includes data from more than 57,000 people across 15 states, both in rural and urban areas. The study represents 363·7 million people or 51% of India's adult population. Similar previous studies have been only regional with small sample sizes, low response rates and with varied diagnostic criteria. For this study, the researchers considered each person's bodyweight, height, waist circumference and blood pressure and used glucose tolerance tests to diagnose diabetes and pre-diabetes.\n\"We have also provided the first-ever data on the status of the diabetes epidemic in the North-Eastern states of India,\" said Dr RM Anjana, vice-president of the Madras Diabetes Research Foundation and the lead author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology.\nThe overall prevalence of diabetes across the 15 states studied was 7.3%. The rates varied between states, from 4.3% in Bihar to 13.6% in Chandigarh. The overall prevalence of pre-diabetes was 10.3% as per the criteria set by the World Health Organisation. Men were more likely to be diabetic than women. Almost half of the people enrolled in the study were previously undiagnosed and were thus not aware of their diabetes until they were tested.\nOn an average, the researchers found diabetes to be twice as common in urban areas at 11.2% compared to the rural areas at 5.2%. However, in the urban areas of more economically advanced states, diabetes was higher among people even from low socio-economic backgrounds – a transition that is already common in high-income countries.\n\"This trend is a matter of great concern because it suggests that the diabetes epidemic is spreading to individuals who can least afford to pay for its management,\" said Anjana. \"The peculiarity about this epidemic in India is the relatively young age of onset compared to the Western world.\"\nThe study suggests that the age of onset is in the age group of 25-34 years, which is at least two decades earlier than in developed countries.\nPeople living in urban areas have access to diabetes care services and can afford the associated out-of-pocket expenditure. However, people living in semi-urban and rural areas do not have access to diabetes centres or clinics that provide comprehensive care. Given that people in rural areas and poorer communities in cities are unable to access care earlier, they would be more prone to advanced complications such as renal failure and blindness due to retinopathy.\nAccording to Anjana, the changing lifestyle of people even among the middle-class and the poor in big cities like Kolkata might be the reason for this demographic shift in the diabetes epidemic.\n\"Those who were walking to work can now afford to take a bus or buy a motorbike and they are discouraged from being physically active,\" she said. \"Also, as affordable fast-food and sweetened beverages become more and easily available, people are encouraged to consume these in large quantities putting their health at risk.\"\nKerala, the state with the highest reported prevalence of diabetes in India so far, has recently imposed a fat-tax. Countries like the United Kingdom are imposing sugar taxes on sweetened food and beverages. Can such taxes help reverse the diabetes epidemic in India?\nAnjana said it might help but only to a some extent. \"It would be the steps taken by individuals for their own health and the government's for their citizens that will help,\" she said. \"People should adopt a healthier lifestyle such as, consuming a healthy diet and increasing physical activity.\"\nMinimising television and screen time, giving breaks to sedentary behavior, using the stairs instead of an elevator, eating more fruits and vegetables, and cutting down junk-food all go a long way in preventing diabetes.\nAnjana also recommends that central and state governments make policy changes and investments to control the burden of non-communicable diseases like diabetes. These measures include ensuring the supply of nutritious food and creating public spaces for people to exercise. The National Program for Control of Diabetes, Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke, which has been rolled out across the country, could also help improve diabetes awareness levels at a national level.\nThe establishment of cost-effective prevention programmes could help, according to Dr Vijay Viswanathan of MV Hospital for Diabetes in Chennai. \"The central government can take up a separate National Diabetes Control Programme and the state governments can improve diabetes care in all rural sub-centres and public health centres by making glucose monitors available and having a diabetes clinic once a week,\" he said. \"They can also have a good referral pattern for people with complications to their state-run hospitals at the district level.\"\nDr Thaksaphon Thamarangsi, director of the department of noncommunicable diseases and environmental health at the WHO regional office in New Delhi said that no single policy or intervention can ensure prevention of non-communicable diseases including diabetes. \"It calls for a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach, in which all sectors systematically consider the health impact of policies in trade, agriculture, finance transport, education and urban planning,\" he said.\nDiabetes and its complications cause substantial economic loss to the patients, their families, and to health systems and national economies through direct medical costs and loss of work and wages. \"The fight to curb or control diabetes must continue,\" said Thamarangsi.\nThe ICMR-NDIAB study will continue to gather diabetes information from remaining states and overall data for India might be available within a few years, said Anjana.\nThis study also highlights the high prevalence of CADRs due to antiretroviral drug as pediatric retroviral infection is comparatively high in the community[23] and immunologically suppressed children are more risky for developing adverse reactions. The present study has few limitations. Being a single-centered study from Southeast India, the results cannot be extrapolated to other hospitals from a different setting. Over the period of 1 year, CADR profile due to various drugs was monitored and the final sample size was reached. Although we monitored all CADRs, there is a possibility of cases being missed out due to patient's interhospital transfer, against medical advice, etc. Hence, our study may not reflect the actual burden of CADRs. Since it is an observational study, we could not follow-up patients for temporal relationship to assess causality and preventability. Thus, we recommend further research and multicentric study to explore other aspects of CADRs.\nTimely diagnosis of the condition and identification of the offending drug and its omission form the cornerstone of management to prevent serious outcomes. A high index of suspicion should be maintained to make a rapid diagnosis and in managing children with severe CADRs to prevent morbidity and mortality."

CBD (Cannabidiol) oil is gaining popularity for its effective and natural pain relief.\nCannabidiol is a compound found in the marijuana plant. It's used widely because it doesn't produce the high associated with marijuana, due to the absence of the psychoactive THC (tetrahydrocannabinol).\nSome believe that CBD might offer chronic pain relief by reducing inflammation. More and more, CBD oil is becoming an alternative to prescription drugs in the treatment of conditions like arthritis and back pain. Apart from pain relief, CBD often helps with better sleep, so it is often used by people suffering from sleep disorders.\nThe extensive usage of CBD oil\nChronic pain can largely hamper everyday life and reduce productivity. Common types of chronic pain include:\nOver-the-counter medications are often prescribed for chronic pain relief but are there other natural options like herbs we should explore? OTC and prescription drugs have a bad rap for the side-effects they cause, not to mention the dependence associated with them. Some theories also suggest that CBD could help solve opioid addiction.\nHow CBD oil might ease pain is still a question the scientists are finding an answer to. But there's some evidence that suggests that CBD could be somehow involved in the functioning of the body's endocannabinoid system, which is a complex system of intracellular communication. The endocannabinoid system influences brain functions like cognition, memory, and mood, and how we experience pain.\nOral administration of CBD has poor bioavailability, which means that when CBD is taken orally, much of it isn't available for effective use by the body. So CBD is applied topically to the areas of pain as the less the circulatory system is involved, the more effective CBD is.\nA 2018 Pediatric Dermatology report reported three cases of topical CBD applications in children with epidermolysis bullosa, a blistering skin condition. All three children healed faster, with less pain, and with no reported adverse effects.\nCannabis-based medicines have also been tested to relieve chronic neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is triggered by a damaged somatosensory (ability to interpret bodily sensation) system. It often occurs in people who suffer from conditions like multiple sclerosis and diabetes. Cannabis-based medicines do relieve chronic pain in addition to helping with sleep difficulties, but they're often associated with side-effects like dizziness and mental confusion. It should also be noted that these side-effects are more likely to occur with drugs containing THC than without it.\nThere hasn't been much research regarding the safe use of CBD. Since no regulations or rules are available at present, CBD oil may (or may not) have varying amounts of the psychoactive THC.\nVaried doses, routes of administration of the non-psychoactive CBD, with different concentrations of THC, have reported many side-effects like:\nCBD may also worsen tremors and muscle movements in people with Parkinson's. CBD oil has also been reported to interact with certain medicines, which consequently show different effects than they're expected to.\nPeople with a suppressed immune system should also take care while administering CBD as cannabis has also been found to contain the fungus Aspergillus, which can infect the administerer. It is also important to note that topical application of CBD oil may also cause skin irritation.\nResearch has also suggested that pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid marijuana. A study in review for the report stated that even a short exposure to CBD increased the placental barrier permeability, thus placing the unborn at risk from more substances reaching it.\nWith the increasing legalization of marijuana in the U.S., CBD oil has become more available. It is now widely sold in various forms; you can spray it under your tongue, take a capsule, sip it in your coffee and so forth. You can also look for CBD products online, but it's better to make sure that it isn't illegal in your state.\nTags: cancerFibromyalgiaIrritable bowel syndromeMigrainesMultiple sclerosisNeuropathic painOsteoarthritispainParkinson's disease\nMetformin Alters Gut Bacteria - Diabetes Health\nMetformin Alters Gut Bacteria\nMetformin is considered as first line of medication for Type 2 Diabetes. Metformin promotes weight loss, lowers increased glucose levels and prevents heart related complications in Diabetes. Research studies have tried to study the mechanism of action of metformin in managing high blood sugar levels. A recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine has indicated that metformin improves microbes present in the gut resulting in improved glucose metabolism. Administration of metformin not only lowers glucose levels but also it improves bile juices, incretin hormone function and improves insulin secretion. This in turn leads to better blood sugar control.\nIt is known that there are two types of bacteria – good bacteria and bad bacteria. Akkermansia and bifidobacterium are two types of good bacteria present in our stomach and play an important part in our gastrointestinal function. These bacteria, when present in a healthy number, regulate metabolism, manage lipid levels and mange fat in the abdomen. Type 2 Diabetes can occur as a result of several factors such as obesity, increased lipid levels, inflammation and insulin resistance. The study conducted on diet-induced obese mice showed that metformin promotes the functioning of akkermansia and bifidobacterium in improving their metabolism.\nMetformin promotes the growth of good bacteria in the gut and helps reduce abdominal obesity and increased lipid levels. This in turn provides better glycaemic control in people with Type 2 Diabetes. This study has shown that people with Type 2 Diabetes who are prescribed metformin have improved metabolism and lowered insulin resistance. Administration of metformin also lowers the risk of inflammation and improved glucose control. Where these findings support metformin as an effective medication for treating various metabolic complications associated with Diabetes, regular exercise and a customised diet plan are also recommended to better manage Diabetes.\nShow Details for the week of October 13th, 2014 « The Monitor\nShow Details for the week of October 13th, 2014\tPosted on October 13, 2014\tKPFT is in pledge drive!

An interview with Meryl Nass\nCNN reports: \"Thomas Eric Duncan, a man with Ebola who traveled to the United States from Liberia, died Wednesday morning at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, the hospital said.\" Reuters reports at least 3,439 people have died in the current outbreak.\nMeryl Nass writes at the Anthrax Vaccine blog. Her recent pieces include: \"Drilling Down Into the Facts Regarding Airborne Spread of Ebola\" and \"U.S. Ebola: [United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head] Frieden Said Every Hospital Was Ready. He is Wrong.\"\nMeryl Nass is a physician in private practice who is known for uncovering the use of anthrax as a biological weapon in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), and for her outspoken criticism of the mandatory use of anthrax vaccine by the military. This use persists despite high rates of serious adverse reactions, and despite the fact that the vaccine was never proven effective nor licensed for the purpose for which it is being used (inhalation anthrax). In fact, the vaccine is in Investigational New Drug (IND) status for inhalation anthrax.\nDr. Nass has been a leading opponent of military policies that continue to treat servicemembers as a ready pool of experimental subjects, in the absence of meaningful informed consent.\nShe has shown that many studies indicate anthrax vaccine is one cause of Gulf War Illnesses, and furthermore that recently vaccinated servicemembers have developed identical illnesses. She has provided testimony before two Institute of Medicine committees on Gulf War Illness exposures (Dec. 15, 1999), and safety and efficacy of the anthrax vaccine (Oct. 3, 2000). She provided written comments to the FDA and the House National Security Subcommittee (Shays' Committee) on Executive Order 13139, which created a new policy regarding use of unlicensed therapeutics in human subjects.\nDr. Nass discussed experimental anthrax vaccine use in testimony to the House National Security Subcommittee on April 29, 1999, and discussed accelerated drug licensing and abbreviated testing of vaccines and drugs intended for responding to bioterrorism in testimony for the House Government Reform Committee hearing on Nov 14, 2001 (\"Preparing a Medical Response to Bioterrorism\") http://www.anthraxvaccine.org/response.htm)\n\"Who Is Protecting the Public Health? Can We Trust the Regulators?\" By Meryl Nass, Z Magazine: http://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/april02nass.htm \"The Anthrax Vaccine Program, and an Analysis of the CDC's Recommendations for Vaccine Use.\" American Journal of Public Health. May 2002.\n\"The Model Emergency Health Powers Act Creates Its Own Emergency\" April 8, 2002.http://www.redflagsweekly.com/nass/2002_april08.html\n\"The Extremely Difficult Task Of Tracking Vaccine-Related Side-Effects.\" April 22, 2002. http://www.redflagsweekly.com/nass/2002_april22.html\nQuote:\"Thomas Eric Duncan died in spite receiving the highest level of intensive care, including dialysis and ventilation. The CDC and much of the media have been saying that you can only get Ebola through direct contact with body fluids — and at the same time they've been backing the use extraordinary measures to prevent transmission. The fact is, there's no doubt that Ebola has a history of airborne droplet transmission and pundits are beginning to admit it. When only one to ten live viral particles are needed to cause an infection you are looking at airborne droplet and fomite transmission as viable routes of spread, and healthcare facilities being a locus of spread. See from the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy: \"Health workers need optimal respiratory protection for Ebola.\" The USAMRIID [United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, based at Fort Detrick, Maryland] and Tulane University had a unit physically located near where the Ebola outbreak began. This unit's job was to test blood for Lassa antibodies; they were also testing for Ebola as part of their work. So USAMRIID had a bird's eye view into the Ebola epidemic from the start. Maybe WHO [World Health Organization] and CDC were too bureaucratically hamstrung to understand the implications of a big Ebola outbreak, but USAMRIID, our premier biodefense center, has no excuse that it did not understand what was happening. The military now says that they proved that Ebola had been in the area for at least eight years and a whopping 9 percent of samples tested positive for Ebola. Why wasn't this noticed?\"\nNass notes the Boston Globe is reporting: \"BU biolab nears OK amid hopes for tackling Ebola, safety concerns.\" But earlier this summer, she points out that there was reporting on widespread escapes at such labs. See: USA Today report in August: \"Hundreds of bioterror lab mishaps cloaked in secrecy.\" Nass states: \"It would be a mistake to license another high containment lab in the middle of Boston when existing labs have a terrible track record of containing the very organisms they are charged with studying.\"\nThis entry was posted in Africa, Ebola, Economic Inequality, Education, Radio Shows, Vaccination and tagged Anthrax Vaccine, Ebola epidemic, Ebola outbreak, Meryl Nass, Thomas Eric Duncan.\nShow Details for the week of September 6th, 2014\tVolunteer Opportunity in Houston Leave a Reply Cancel reply\tEnter your comment here...\nBack on board: brand AMRI and patients\nThe sign announcing the hospital's new name (in picture left by Bishwarup Dutta); and the board blank in January 2012\n• April 2011: AMRI Women and Child Hospital\n• December 2011: Vision Care Hospital\n• February 2014: AMRI Hospitals: in collaboration with Vision Care\nBrand AMRI is back on the signboards of its hospital in Mukundapur after a three-year exile.\nThe change was apparently carried out after the state government renewed the hospital's clinical establishment licence last February.\nThe hospital, located off the Bypass, had come under the scanner in the wake of the fire tragedy at AMRI Dhakuria in December 2011, prompting the management to give the facility a name completely different from the original.\nAMRI Women and Child Hospital became Vision Care Hospital when the health department revoked AMRI Dhakuria's licence and slapped a showcause notice on the Mukundapur unit for running a women and children's hospital on a plot allotted for a low-cost eyecare centre.\nIn its newest avatar, the hospital retains its identity as \"Vision Care\" while restoring the brand name AMRI.\nThree names in as many years tell the story of how AMRI has clawed back after its fall from favour following the fire tragedy that claimed 91 lives on December 9, 2011.\n\"We have verbally informed the state health department about the change of name and they have agreed since Vision Care is still there on the board,\" an official of the hospital said.\nSince the tag AMRI was reintroduced, occupancy has increased by around 70 per cent, a source said.\n\"There was lot of confusion among people over the (interim) name. The general perception was that ours was an ophthalmology unit,\" said Rupak Barua, group CEO of AMRI Hospitals.\nSources at Swastha Bhavan, the headquarters of the health department, said they agreed to the change in name based on a verbal assurance that the words \"Vision Care\" would be displayed on the signboards along with the AMRI brand.\nThe one setback for the hospital has been the department's refusal to grant a licence for kidney transplants following a recent inspection.\nApart from gynaecology and neonatology, the hospital currently admits male patients for neurology, ENT and general surgery.\nThe Mukundapur hospital had applied for a licence under the Clinical Establishments Act in mid-2012 after its one-year provisional permit lapsed.\nThe health department didn't issue a licence until this February, although it allowed the hospital to operate all along under the name Vision Care. \"There is a provision under which a hospital can operate if they have applied for renewal of licence,\" a health department official said.\nThe 150-bed hospital's occupancy rate as a women and children's facility under the AMRI banner had been about 60 per cent. Occupancy declined to less than 50 per cent after the name was changed to Vision Care, sources said.\nAn official of the health department said the decision to allow AMRI to be added to the name Vision Care reflected the change in the government's position since early last year.\nEight of the AMRI directors had been arrested immediately after the December 2011 fire. They are all out on bail after spending varying periods in jail.\nThe outpatient department of AMRI Dhakuria reopened in January, two months after acquiring a fresh licence.\nGeneva doctor receives humanitarian award | Kane County Chronicle\nGeneva doctor receives humanitarian award\nDr. Beth Froese (center) received Northwestern Medicine's the Rev.

Froese is standing with awards program committee members Jaclyn Hughes (right) and Ann Marie Andexler (left).\nGENEVA – Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital in Geneva honored a doctor for her medical mission work with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Humanitarian Award, officials announced in a news release.\nDr. Beth Froese, a physical medicine and rehabilitation medicine specialist at Northwestern Medicine Regional Medical Group in Geneva and Warrenville, received the award Jan. 11 during the 39th annual awards program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, the release stated.\nFroese was recognized for her medical mission work, which has included trips around the globe to locations including Nepal and El Salvador, the release stated.\nFroese also traveled to a remote village in Kenya to provide volunteer medical care and train local residents as community health officers empowering them to better the health of their family, friends and neighbors, the release stated.\nFroese does her mission work through World Relief, an organization that partners with local churches in the U.S. and abroad to transform vulnerable communities economically, socially and spiritually, the release stated.\nNorthwestern Medicine launched the Humanitarian Awards Program in 1979 to commemorate the life and legacy of King and to celebrate his virtues and the ideals of community giving, equality, unity and excellence, the release stated.\nThe award honors individuals, both employees and physicians from across the Northwestern Medicine health system, who best exemplify the ideals of King, as demonstrated by a positive impact in the community, the release stated.\nSince its creation, the Humanitarian Award has been awarded to 74 employees and 27 physicians, the release stated.\nI could hear my heart pounding in my head – Tim's story\nIt was Tim's wife who helped him overcome his reluctance to see his doctor, twice, despite some troubling symptoms. And her 'encouragement' saved his life.\nI started to have unusual headaches\nMy blood pressure had probably been rising for quite a while before I noticed that something was wrong. But then, in January 2004, I started to have unusual headaches – they were behind the ears and round the nape of the neck. Then I started to experience a loss of vision and found that I was struggling to sleep at night because I could hear the sound of my heart pounding in my head.\nMy wife was very concerned and wanted me to see my doctor, which was the last thing I wanted to do. But when a colleague had to bring me home from the office because I was too ill to drive, my wife wouldn't take no for an answer and I found myself at my doctor's surgery.\nAfterwards my wife told me she was sure there was something wrong. Despite my best efforts to hide it from her, she knew that I was still having the headaches and she could actually see my veins pulsing in time with my heartbeat. She continued to 'encourage' me to see my doctor and, much to her relief, I eventually gave in.\nEight days later I emerged from hospital clutching a collection of new and different medicines and a diagnosis of malignant (or accelerated) hypertension. This is a very rare form of extremely high blood pressure that requires hospital treatment, but despite the name, has nothing to do with cancer at all.\nTwo years on, things are back pretty much as they were. However, I am a little older and much wiser – I cycle more than before and I watch my health. I also pass this advice on to my work mates and even take my clinically validated home blood pressure monitor along so they can check themselves.\nIn fact, a colleague discovered that they too had high blood pressure, and is being successfully treated.\nAwards, incentive diplomas, letters of appreciation, results of competitions, achievements in science and creativity;\n\nI just finished publishing a detailed article�for subscribers to my website detailing my view that Cytokinetics offers asymmetric upside potential.…\nI listened carefully to CEO Robert Blum speaking at the Piper Jaffrey conference on December 1.

Base government funding for the network is for seven and a half years, but each heart research centre is expected to raise additional funding for research.\n\"The government has recognised the chronic issue around cardiovascular disease, particularly the inequity around Māori and Pacific,\" says Manaaki Mānawa's director, Professor Julian Paton.\n\"Most families experience or suffer from cardiovascular disease. Unlike pandemics that will go away one day, heart disease has not gone away. We can slow it down but it would be wonderful to think that in the future we could completely reverse it or prevent it.\"\nJulian arrived at the University three years ago, from the University of Bristol, to create Auckland's heart research centre. He says the city has a unique environment, where research is being done right on the doorstep of a main hospital and multiple disciplines can be integrated.\nUnlike pandemics that will go away one day, heart disease has not gone away. We can slow it down but it would be wonderful to think that in the future we could completely reverse it or prevent it.\nProfessor Julian Paton, Director of Manaaki Mānawa Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland\nOne of the centre's big achievements to date is setting up the Cardiac Inherited Diseases Registry, recording details of patients who have been saved from sudden cardiac death events.\n\"This has enabled us to alert family members to the possibility that they may have these mutations. It has allowed subsequent genotyping, which has then made them aware of whether or not they are at risk.\"\nAnother example of research is the Multi-Ethnic New Zealand Study of Acute Coronary Syndrome (MENZACS). In this study, samples are taken from people who have had a heart attack to find out more about the factors that predisposed them to it. It is the first such local study to look at ethnicity differences.\nJulian says a key vision for Manaaki Mānawa is to achieve heart health equity in Aotearoa.\n\"Maori and Pacific people don't live as long as non-Maori and Pacific, by about seven to eight years, predominantly because of heart disease. New Zealand has a unique and diverse population and we need to move away from a one size fits all strategy to solve the problem of heart failure for the benefit of all people in Aotearoa.\"\nDr Anna Rolleston co-chairs the Māori advisory group for Manaaki Mānawa and says researchers will collaborate with Māori and Pacific communities.\n\"One of our goals is for the community to feel like they have a voice. I don't think many clinicians and researchers go out to the community to talk to them. But we need to do something different to make a difference.\n\"We hope Manaaki Mānawa will be like a blueprint for other health research groups that need to collaborate more.\"\nDetails of the fundraising campaign for Manaaki Mānawa will be sent to staff, alumni and friends of the University of Auckland in March 2021."

If the answer is yes, then you're about to experience a procedure that millions have already faced. Read this article to find out more about surgery and make sure this is something you want to do. You should bring with you to your doctor's appointment, a list of questions that you have regarding this information.\n<br/>There is a lot of information that needs gathered before you get cosmetic surgery. You should know the length of your recovery period, for instance. Different procedures require different recovery times. You can avoid any issues if you make sure that you understand the procedure fully.\n<br/>When it comes to plastic surgery, there are a few options that can help with cost. You can go overseas to a country with a good plastic surgery reputation This may not be an option for you, but you should take it into consideration.\n<br/>Look into alternative ways of financing surgery. The surgeon often knows that a lot of people are not able to come up with the money right away, so they can put payments in place. If the doctor cannot help, look into other financing options so that you don't have to pay the entire cost upfront.\n<br/>Blood loss often happens during surgery. This is a common occurrence with any surgery, but excessive blood loss and bleeding can lead to complications. Bleeding may begin during the course of surgery or even afterwards. If you bleed a lot after surgery, the blood can pool underneath the skin and require additional surgery. For this reason, it is imperative that you talk with your doctor about any blood loss and bruising post-op.\n<br/>To ensure you use a surgeon who is competent, ask how often the surgeon performs the procedure. The more often the surgeon performs the procedure, the more advance his skills are likely to be. As they perform more surgeries, they will have greater experience. With a larger group of previous patients, you are likely to see reports of malpractice or errors, if applicable.\n<br/>You must choose a surgeon who has certification from the official Plastic Surgeon board. Ask your doctor if he has performed the specific procedure you are thinking of many times, and if he can provide proof of the results.\n<br/>Ask your doctor for photographs of previous work so you can see the results to expect. It will say a lot about how much you can trust the surgeon if you find out whether he is willing to show you photos of some patient who had to have a procedure corrected. If you are unimpressed with the cosmetic surgeon's work as illustrated in the photos, find another doctor.\n<br/>What questions will you ask the doctor? There are actually several bits of information you need to find out before planning any cosmetic procedure. Check to see if the surgeon has been board certified. Also, ask to view pictures of previous surgeries he or she has performed. Inquire about everything including the procedure, recovery time and medications needed.\n<br/>Cosmetic surgery is something that millions of people choose to do every year. If you are one of the masses, this information was for you. It ought to help you engage in valuable consultation with a doctor so that you are completely prepared for the process.\nCommon \"Pleural Effusion\" queries answered by top doctors | iCliniq\niCliniq / Answers / Medical oncology / Pleural Effusion\nPleural effusion is a medical condition where there is excessive accumulation of fluid inside the lungs. Pleura is a membrane that covers the outside the lungs and inside of the chest. It has excess production of fluid when it becomes inflamed or irritated. Some diseases can result in pleural effusion. They are pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, kidney disease, and congestive heart failure. There is shortness of breath with chest pain.

Moletta was later suspended by his team for suspected doping, but the police could not prosecute the rider on the basis of the pills because they were perfectly legal. They were Viagra.\nIt's possible that Moletta – or his father – was using the Viagra for the reasons with which the drug is most commonly associated. But more and more evidence is starting to suggest that Viagra may be performance-enhancing when used at altitude.\nTesting the science of Viagra\nA team of scientists from Stanford University and the Veteran Affairs department of the Palo Alto Health Care system carried out an experiment in which cyclists completed an identical time to exhaustion test at altitude with and without Viagra, or sildenafil as it's known in scientific circles. On average, performance was improved when taking Viagra by a whopping 15 per cent. But the average result masked what was really going on.\nSome responded to the Viagra in an incredibly positive way, recording a 39 per cent average improvement, while others found no improvement or even a slight decline in performance.\nWhy Viagra is not recommended for sports people\nOne reason might be susceptibility to side effects. When taking Viagra some of the cyclists in the study said they suffered from headaches, a flushed face and blue-tinged vision. One individual had to withdraw from the trial altogether because of the severity of the headaches. Even some who improved said they felt more fatigued and less able to focus when taking the drug. Anne Friedlander, who was part of the research team, believes this could be due to the Viagra making them push too hard.\n\"The improved performance could cause side effects from over exertion at altitude beyond what the body would normally be prepared to do,\" she said. \"There could also be side effects we don't even know about resulting from the changes in the direction of blood flow to less optimal tissues.\"\nFor this reason Friedlander and her co-researchers do not recommend Viagra as a performance-enhancing drug for sports people, especially given their experiments also showed it didn't improve performance at sea level.\nBlood-pumping good news\nAlthough Viagra might not be suitable for cyclists because of its possible side effects, understanding the science behind it certainly could be.\nViagra has the effect of widening blood vessels and attacking the plaque-like patches that build up inside arteries and attract cholesterol. These cause heart disease and high blood pressure, and also prevent oxygen transferring as easily from the lungs into the arteries. Viagra was in fact originally developed as a drug to reduce blood pressure, before its other qualities were discovered.\n\"The hypothesis is that Viagra widens the pulmonary vessels, thus allowing more blood to leave the heart,\" said Friedlander. \"It also removes the 'patchiness' which means more oxygen can pass from the lungs into the blood. More oxygen in the blood plus more blood being pumped means more oxygen reaching the tissues and increased performance.\"\nIn the study, the cyclists who responded well to Viagra found the drug increased the amount of blood pumped from their hearts by 25 per cent at rest and 32 per cent during exercise. Stroke volume, the amount of blood pumped with each contraction of the heart, was also significantly increased. So the Viagra partly counteracted the effects of altitude – lack of oxygen – and meant that blood flow was not reduced by nearly as much as it normally would have been.\nThis also explains why Viagra is not effective at sea level. It's only when blood flow from the heart is reduced that it can help. At sea level, pulmonary constriction is not limiting to performance because oxygen is so plentiful that the red blood cells, which transport the oxygen round our bodies, get completely saturated with oxygen whether our arteries are constricted or not. It is only when the air is thin and oxygen is less abundant that widening the arteries has an effect.\nAttacking the problem with natural solutions\nCyclists are better known for attacking the problem of improving blood circulation – and hence performance – from the opposite angle. Rather than widening arteries to let more oxygen be transferred and more blood to flow, they've found ways to get the body to produce more of the oxygen-carrying red blood cells.\nTo do this you need more of the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which stimulates the production of red blood cells. This can be done naturally – and legally – by altitude training: the brain recognises that there is less oxygen available and therefore produces more EPO to compensate; or it can be done illegally, as the sport of cycling knows only too well, by simply injecting the EPO.\nBut that doesn't mean cyclists can't also look at ways to widen and clean up their arteries too. After all, it's good for preventing heart disease as well as for cycling performance.\nGarlic is often called the natural Viagra as it contains a substance called allicin which improves blood flow. It's also an anti-oxidant meaning it attacks the patches of cholesterol that build up. A joint study by researchers from Oxford and the US found that 261 subjects who took a garlic supplement for 12 weeks reduced their cholesterol level by 12 per cent.\nOther foods high in antioxidants like broccoli and berries will do likewise. Similarly, Omega 3s, those helpful unsaturated fats contained abundantly in nuts and oily fish, have many healthy properties, and one in particular is to thin the blood, making it flow more easily and meaning those plaque-like patches don't form.\nOf course, the most effective way for a cyclist to improve blood flow and performance is through training. Standard training techniques work on all the aspects of blood circulation discussed here, and in general do so far more effectively than Viagra or any other supplement is ever likely to. So, until you feel you've trained all that you possibly can, you can probably go on deleting those Viagra spam emails just a little while longer.\nGuest Blog: The road to recovery after a major stroke – Your own mental health – Journey into Hope\nMy mum had no empathy or awareness of what was going on and it was an exceptionally lonely two years of my life.

He was previously in clinical practice at NEWS from 1998 to 2011, where he practiced Integrative Medicine with Drs. Elizabeth Schultz, DO and Kirk Melville, MD, in Watkinsville, Georgia. He specializes in Acupuncture, Oriental Internal Medicine and Naturopathic Internal Medicine (botanical medicine, functional medicine, homeopathic medicine and nutritional medicine).\nI highly recommend Dr. McDonald. He is kind, attentive, and very knowledgable. He has helped me immensely with thyroid issues, stress, and even muscle pain. I cannot praise this practice enough.\nMy experience with Dr. McDonald has been wonderful. He has a very caring and kind demeanor. I never feel rushed during the appointments and I know that I am well taken care of. He has helped me tremendously with his excellent skills in not only Acupuncture, but natural medicine needs as well. What a wonderful outcome for me to be able to control some of my medical issues and come off of prescription drugs by switching to healthier alternative methods.\nI went to Dr. McDonald for the \"stress treatment\" that he offers. I was a bit hesitant at first because i have horrible anxiety and i HATE needles. I am so glad i tried it because the treatment was very successful and I didn't even feel the needles! i definitely recommend trying it out!\nDr. McDonald was referred to me by a friend. I was looking for some help for my son�s anxiety and ADHD symptoms. My son has struggled with anxiety for several years now. We have tried prescription drugs and they just seem to make him very agitated. Since he has started seeing Dr. McDonald for acupuncture treatments he has had much less anxiety. Dr. McDonald also has him on some natural supplements to help treat the underlying cause of the anxiety and ADHD symptoms.\nI have also had acupuncture treatments from Dr. McDonald; as you see the apple doesn�t fall far from the tree. I have not been this relaxed in years!! Very thankful that we have found Dr. McDonald!!\nIf your having the Monday blahs, then it sounds like you need to call the office and make an appointment to help turn that frown upside down!

Dr. McDonald's answer is GARLIC! Garlic is one of the most effective natural antimicrobial agents known and acts on a broad spectrum of bacteria, viruses, alimentary worms, fungi, and\nApathy and depression are among the most disabling non-motor features of PSP, and they’re not the same thing. To quote the opening lines of an excellent 1998 paper from Morgan L. Levy and colleagues from UCLA, University of Iowa and the NIH,\n“Apathy is defined as diminished motivation not attributable to decreased level of consciousness, cognitive impairment, or emotional distress. Depression involves considerable emotional distress, evidenced by tearfulness, sadness, anxiety, agitation, insomnia, anorexia, feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, and recurrent thoughts of death.”\nThat article, entitled, “Apathy Is Not Depression,” focused on Alzheimer’s, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and PSP. It pointed out that while apathy is traditionally considered to be one of the many possible features of depression, it can also be analyzed separately. So that’s what they did.\nThey found that among their 22 patients with PSP, 77% had apathy without depression, 5% had depression without apathy, 14% had both and 5% had neither. In the 154 patients overall, there was no correlation between apathy and depression. (Among the 22 with PSP, there were too few with depression to calculate the correlation specifically for that disease.) Apathy was more common and severe in AD, FTD and PSP, while depression was more common and severe in PD and HD. In the overall group, apathy was associated with disinhibition, but depression was associated with anxiety, agitation, irritability and hallucinations.\nThe prevalence of depression and apathy in PSP vary wildly across studies, depending on definitions and sources of patients. For example, fast-forward to a December 2021 study from Sarah M. Bower and colleagues at Mayo Clinic Rochester. In their 97 patients with PSP, depression was present in 55% and apathy in only 12%. This proportion was roughly the same for each of the nine PSP subtypes evaluated except for PSP-speech/language, where depression was much less frequent.\nWhy should we care about the distinction between apathy and depression? Because they’re both treatable and the treatments differ. Here’s a compilation of recommendations from experts at UCSF and from the CurePSP Centers of Care. Keep in mind that these recommendations are generally based on experience and record reviews rather than on randomized trials.\nDepression in PSP is typically treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (except for paroxetine because of its anticholinergic side effects), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or bupropion. Non-drug treatments include cognitive-behavior therapy, mindfulness yoga, professionally guided meditation, and in very severe cases, electroconvulsive therapy.\nApathy in PSP, on the other hand, is treated with one of the amphetamine-like drugs methylphenidate or modafinil, or sometimes an SNRI. Apathy can be worsened by SSRIs. Regular conditioning exercise is also useful.\nSo, add this to the long list of reasons why it’s so wrong for a doctor to tell someone with PSP, “Sorry, but there’s nothing I can do for you.”\nScientists cease up oned the condition of a hearty and efficient method for whole-genome ape number utilizing of come out tumor assembly rooms (CTCs) from a unconcerned by blood inquest. In contrast to persist in methods that are complex and costly, the single-tube, single-step congresses is able to label absolute Replica Covey Remodelling in turns (CNA) in one cells and contend Loosely precision at a cut cost than stable genomic research procedure, admission up to the possibility for genome-driven objected therapy pot-pourri and monitoring of malady course in fluid biopsy.\nThe genome of tumor apartments fires wholly multiple aberration sequels which are intimately combined to the underlying tumor biology and are on in the CNA make a bundle of the continuous genome. Multiple lately findings across some cancer examples have unmistakeable to the occurrence that these topic of aberrations are associate to expanded reaction or guerillas to extraordinary classifications of treatments, kind from trustworthy chemotherapy to PARP-inhibitors and Nurtured checkpoint inhibitors. \"A breed of analytical techniques attired in b be engaged to been manipulated to analyze copy-number delegates in the research lab,\" resolved Nicolò Manaresi, Ph.D., out writer of the review. \"In any way, they are not showily appealed for clinical relevancy on CTCs where reproducibility, robustness and scalability are editorial writers for. Our approach furnishes a streamlined, ultra-conservative expensive method for genome-wide CNA gaining of distinguish cancer apartments.\" Dr. Manaresi also suits as Chief Well-organized Catchpole at Menarini-Silicon Biosystems, footed in Bologna and Huntingdon Valley, PA.

R.\nGut;Oct2006, Vol. 55 Issue 10, p1409\nBackground and aims: Diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is based on arbitrary criteria due to the lack of an accurate diagnostic test. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether rectosigmoid tone modification after a meal represents an accurate diagnostic approach. Methods: In a secondary care setting, 32 constipation predominant and 24 diarrhoea predominant IBS patients, 10 functional diarrhoea and 10 functional constipation patients, 29 organic gastrointestinal disease patients, and 10 healthy volunteers underwent a rectal barostat test to measure fasting and postprandial rectosigmoid tone. Rectosigmoid response was assessed following three meals containing different amounts of calories: 200 kcal, 400 kcal and 1000 kcal. Results: After 200 kcal, healthy volunteers and patients with organic diseases showed a reduction in rectosigmoid volume of at least 28% of fasting volume, indicating a meal induced increase in muscle tone. In contrast, patients with diarrhoea predominant IBS showed dilation of the rectosigmoid colon, indicative of reduced tone, and patients with constipation predominant IBS showed a mild volume reduction or no modification. Functional diarrhoea and constipation patients showed rectosigmoid tone modification resembling that of the corresponding IBS subtype. A 400 kcal meal normalised rectosigmoid tone in more than half of the constipation predominant IBS patients but none of the diarrhoea predominant IBS patients. In contrast, a 1000 kcal meal normalised tone response in all IBS patients. Sensitivity of the test was 100%, specificity 93%, positive predictive value 96%, and negative predictive value 100%. Conclusion: A postprandial reduction in rectosigmoid tone of at least 28% of fasting value after a low caloric meal accurately separates organic and functional gastrointestinal disease patients. This parameter may therefore be used in the positive diagnosis of IBS.\nRelated ArticlesFunctional Bowel Disorders in Iranian Population using Rome III Criteria.

Farah Shaikh Foods 4 Better Health 2017-05-10T04:49:25Z 2017-08-31 10:23:16 Blood Pressure,Food Facts https://www.foodsforbetterhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Lemongrass-For-High-Blood-Pressure-1-150x100.png\nHome > Health Conditions > Blood Pressure > Is Lemongrass Good for High Blood Pressure?\nLemongrass is botanically known as Cymbopogon citratus. It grows well in warm and tropical regions, and is widely used in Asian cuisine due to its flavor and citrus-like smell. But, lemongrass also has medicinal properties, and when taken with tea, it can reduce cold and cough symptoms, as well as help control high blood pressure. But how effective is lemongrass for high blood pressure? Let's take a closer look.\nHow to Use Lemongrass for High Blood Pressure?\nLemongrass contains antioxidants, phenolic compounds, and flavonoids. It also contains anti-cholesterol and anti-atherosclerosis properties, which reduce the absorption of cholesterol in the intestine, keeping bad cholesterol at bay. Lemongrass helps in the oxidation of LDL cholesterol in the blood and prevents atherosclerotic plaque buildup.\nLemongrass has good amounts of vitamins A and C, as well as zinc. It also has magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and iron. The potassium content, in particular, helps regulate blood pressure.\nDrinking a glass of lemongrass juice in the morning helps lower high blood pressure and boost blood circulation in the body. It also helps to get rid of uric acid, harmful toxins, and fats, as it works as a diuretic to cleanse and detoxify the body. It increases the frequency and quantity of urination, which helps to flush out bad cholesterol and other toxins.\nTo use lemongrass for high blood pressure, simply steep dried or fresh lemongrass in a cup of hot water for five to 10 minutes, then strain and add a sweetener. You can also use ready-to-use lemongrass tea bags. Or, you can simply add lemongrass to soups to reap its health benefits.\nRelated: More Health Benefits of Lemongrass\nResearch Findings on Lemongrass\nHere are a few case studies which show how lemongrass helps in high blood pressure.\nA study published in Lipids and conducted at the Department of Nutritional Sciences, University of Wisconsin showed that consuming 140-milligram capsules of lemongrass oil daily lowered cholesterol levels and blood fats. It lowered cholesterol levels from 310 to 294 on an average.\nBe sure to consult your doctor before taking lemongrass supplements to reduce high blood pressure. Using lemongrass for blood pressure is effective, but you shouldn't consume it in excess. A few studies have shown that excessive consumption of lemongrass has some side effects.\nAn animal study conducted on rats and published in the Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine states that lemongrass oil has anti-hyperlipidemic properties. It helps maintain normal cholesterol and triglycerides serum levels.\nLemongrass prevents the accumulation and blockage of lipids in the blood vessels. It also promotes the smooth and unobstructed flow of blood, which prevents cardiac disorders like atherosclerosis.\nA thesis presented to the Nursing Faculty of San Pedro College showed that patients who took lemongrass tea for two weeks had decreased blood pressure. The participants were given 180 milliliters of lemongrass tea every morning after breakfast. The mean pre-blood pressure reading was 153/0 mmHg, and the mean post-blood pressure reading was 141/82 mmHg, both above normal.\nA study conducted by the Pharmacy Department at the University of Malakand and published in Medical Forum Monthly states that excessive intake of lemongrass decreases systolic blood pressure, and slightly increases diastolic blood pressure.\nLemongrass is a powerful antioxidant which keeps liver and pancreas healthy. It also keeps the cholesterol levels normal.\nThere are many other foods that can help maintain your blood pressure in addition to lemongrass. You can easily incorporate these foods into your balanced diet as snacks.\nGrapes contain a chemical called resveratrol which helps lower blood pressure.\nFlaxseeds have high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids which help prevent cardiovascular diseases. Consuming flaxseed or flaxseed oil helps lower blood pressure in people with hypertension.\nSunflower seeds are a good source of vitamins E and K.

However, anything in excess is harmful, and lemongrass is no exception.\nIf you are hypertensive and on medication, use lemongrass with caution as it may lower your blood pressure more than required. Be sure to consult your doctor if you want to make it a part of your daily diet.\nAvoid lemongrass if you are pregnant. Lemongrass is known to trigger menstruation, so it may result in miscarriage if consumed during pregnancy.\nOther Ways to Maintain Normal Blood Pressure\nCertain lifestyle changes are essential to maintaining a healthy blood pressure. You should avoid consuming high amounts of sodium, saturated fats, red meats, and sweets.\nIn addition to consuming lemongrass for high blood pressure, you should also increase the intake of fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables, dairy, whole grain foods, fish, nuts, and poultry.

I am not making any claims in this article, I am only stating my observations and asking a question I have not yet heard anyone ask: could the spike protein affect the environment?\nThe reason I am asking this question is because I have noticed and have been told of people suffering from bizarre symptoms after being in contact with vaccinated people. There seems to be some kind of transmission going on. Also, in the opinion of several scientists, animals can be infected with Covid, and we have seen news of tigers, dogs and cats apparently getting Covid. There is now talk of injecting animals with the messenger RNA injections.\nWe are also able to identify Covid in sewerage, which may indicate that the spike protein is excreted.\nIf it were just the natural spike proteins occurring from infection with Covid, I believe nature can cope with that, as it can with most things. The actual amount of spike protein in the body as part of the virus itself is not that high. However, the injections now given against the virus are stimulating cells to manufacture spike proteins. Billions of messenger RNA is sent into the body and telling the body to make billions of spike protein. These can then be excreted through the breath, droplets (coughing, sneezing), sweat, urine and stool. Billions of people are now spike protein factories.\nNature is able to deal with a lot. But it does suffer if there is pollution. Pollution is too much of one particular thing which nature cannot deal with (for example all those surgical masks that are ending up in the ocean now).\nNever before has nature had to deal with billions of creatures each manufacturing billions of a specific, potentially lethal protein. And most of these proteins will end up in the oceans, forests, other animals, insects, fish, trees, plants, flowers… how will nature cope with this? This is an experiment that does not just affect people, this is an experiment that will affect the whole planet for years to come. Nobody knows how this will affect our natural environment. What if this protein does not only affect domesticated animals, what if it affects essential soil life? What if it affects our bees or other pollinators? As humans we are so convinced of our own righteousness and superiority, but honestly, nobody has any idea about what this protein will affect. We are living in the greatest experiment of all time, and it could cost us everything.\nPersonally I believe research is needed on what else the spike protein will affect. We need to know whether this human experiment will affect our natural environment and whether we are able to stop this protein from entering our natural environment and our food chain. Because if we can't, we may have just made the biggest mistake in human history. A mistake which could not only wipe out mankind, but all life on the entire planet.\nInformation to look at:\nPfizer study: \"A PHASE 1/2/3, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED, OBSERVER-BLIND, DOSE-FINDING STUDY TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY, TOLERABILITY, IMMUNOGENICITY, AND EFFICACY OF SARS-COV-2 RNA VACCINE CANDIDATES AGAINST COVID-19 IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS\"\nNote page 67, \"Exposure during pregnancy\" – \"Environmental Exposure\"\nhttps://cdn.pfizer.com/pfizercom/202011/C4591001_Clinical_Protocol_Nov2020.pdf\nPeer reviewed medical article, \"Reverse-transcribed SARS-CoV-2 RNA can integrate into the genome of cultured human cells and can be expressed in patient-derived tissues\"\nTags: environmentfood for thoughtSpike protein\nLory Keller says:\nGratitude for your insight, Zaia.

Often, people try a myriad of remedies for their tooth pain, including taking over-the-counter pain medications, using pain gels and even placing aspirin on their teeth. While some of these methods can help relieve a portion of your pain, some can prove damaging.\nMost people are never able to fully rid themselves of the pain and continue to suffer. This is why it is imperative you see the Emergency Dentist in Cedar Grove when tooth pain strikes. The emergency dentist can find the cause of your pain, treat it and stop it. This can give you the relief a bottle of pills cannot.\nIf you are suffering of tooth pain, it is imperative to find what is causing it. Tooth pain is commonly caused by cavities. Cavities do not exhibit symptoms right away. As the decay progresses into the tooth, the nerve becomes irritated and even inflamed. As swelling and pressure increase, the tooth can begin to cause you serious pain. If the decay is allowed to continue, it can cause permanent damage and even tooth death. The Emergency Dentist will X-ray your tooth and examine it, to see how deep the decay runs. The tooth will then be treated, by removing the decayed areas and filling it. This protects your tooth from further damage and effectively stops the pain you were feeling.\nAnother cause of severe tooth pain is infection. Infections can be serious and spread to your other teeth and even your gum tissue. The symptoms of tooth infections, also called abscesses, can be swelling and redness around the tooth, severe pain, swelling in the jaw, foul odors coming from the mouth, pus drainage and bleeding around the tooth and fever. If you are experiencing any of these signs, you need to see the Emergency Dentist in Cedar Grove right away. Your tooth will need a root canal performed and you will need to have antibiotic therapy, so the infection can be cleared.\nIf you are in need of general of Cosmetic Dentistry services, visit http://littlefallsfamilydental.com/ .

The imaging is called magnetoencephalography, also known as MEG. The noninvasive technique measures and produces images of brain activity and function. It is used in diagnosing and pre-surgical planning for epilepsy and brain tumors.\n\"It's a more comprehensive way of looking at the brain,\" said Dr. Andrew Zillgitt, director, Beaumont's Level 4 Adult Epilepsy program and director of the Beaumont MEG program. \"As medical technology continues to evolve, our new MEG system is another critical tool for diagnosing and treating epilepsy. MEG provides us more information, helping us decide whether surgery is a viable option and, if so, how to do the surgery in the safest manner possible for each individual patient.\"\nDr. Daniel Arndt, chief, Pediatric Neurology and director, Pediatric Epilepsy Program, Beaumont, Royal Oak, added, \"We're pleased to be one of only three health systems in Michigan with MEG technology. This is huge for our patients and enhances the capabilities of our Level 4 pediatric epilepsy program.\"\nDr. Zillgitt said, \"It's not new technology, but it is underutilized and still not widely available. There has been a lot of developments in MEG technology the past 20 years. Today's systems are more advanced with user-friendly software.\"\nDr. Arndt said, \"We can learn so much about a patient's brain activity, specifically where motor, hearing, vision, sensory and language functions are located, all without surgery. Its ability to localize the origin of seizures helps us plan the placement of depth electrodes in the brain using ROSA robot technology in stereo-EEG evaluations for pediatric and adult epilepsy surgery candidates. From a parent's or child's perspective, the experience of getting a MEG scan is quiet, and unlike with MRIs, you're not enclosed or confined, but out in the open. Importantly, just like MRI, the MEG is magnet-based technology, so there is no radiation exposure.\"\nOngoing research with MEG involves other neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, autism, PTSD, depression, traumatic brain injury and ADHD.\nEpilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. Abnormal electrical activity in the brain causes the disorder. Nearly 109,000 Michigan residents have epilepsy, including 13,600 children.One-third have drug-resistant epilepsy. For those, surgery may be a treatment option.\nTips for writing an effective research paper Essay Academic Writing Service hapaperzoxh.tiami.us\nWriting a research paper with innovative and groundbreaking findings might be a difficult task in itself, but a carefully formulated title is also just. 8 tips on writing an outstanding homework or test essay order a custom essay or research paper developed from scratch from the experienced authors and.

Due to an error in the immune system, the cells that produce insulin (beta cells in the Islets of Langerhans in the pancreas) are destroyed. As a result the beta cells produce no or hardly any insulin. It is still not completely clear what the precise cause of diabetes type 1 is. Genetic susceptibility plays a (relatively small) role and probably also environmental factors, such as diet and infections. Diabetes type 1 can arise at any age, but usually occurs among children and young adults. Because insufficient insulin is produced, people with diabetes type 1 must inject insulin daily.\nFood and drinks supply carbohydrates to the body. These carbohydrates are turned into glucose in the small intestine. The cells in the body need this glucose as a source of energy. Insulin is made in the Islet of Langerhans of the pancreas and is delivered to the blood. Insulin ensures that the glucose can be absorbed easily by the body cells; it basically opens the door of the cell, so the glucose can enter. That is why it is important that sufficient insulin is available to process the glucose in food.\nThere are various signals that may point to diabetes type 1. Symptoms of diabetes type 1 are as follows:\nA lot of thirst and much peeing, losing weight while having a healthy appetite, weakness/muscle pain, very tired and/or irritable, being nauseous or vomiting and blurry vision.\nIt is important to quickly visit the physician if you recognize many symptoms. The physician can use a blood test to determine whether or not it is diabetes type 1.\nA hypo is short for a hypoglycaemia or, in other words, low levels of blood sugar. If there is insufficient glucose present in the blood (less than 3mmil/l), people have a so-called hypo. The symptoms are shaking, sweating, headache, dizziness, decreased concentration, fatigue, hunger and high irritability. Someone with a very serious hypo can even lose consciousness.\nA hyper is short for hyperglycaemia or, in other words, high levels of blood sugar. Frequent urination, serious thirst, fatigue and a dry tongue are symptoms if someone has high glucose levels for an extended time. Even a coma is possible. If the blood sugar is too high often, then there is a higher chance of complications of diabetes on the long term.\nDiabetes can have destructive effects on many important areas of the body, but especially on the large blood vessels, kidneys, eyes and nerves. On the long term, this can lead to complications such as blindness and cardiovascular disorders.\nTreatment aims to normalize the blood glucose level as much as possible and thereby reduce the risk of serious complications. The aim is to administer the right amount of insulin or hypoglycaemic tablets in changing conditions, and to correctly balance diet and exercise.\nDiabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases in children and teenagers. And the rapid increase in diabetes among children is alarming. More and more children are developing diabetes at an increasingly younger age. Between 1988 and 1990, it was at 9.2 years of age, now it is 7.6. Due to the younger age, there is also more risk of complications because of longer lifetime exposure to diabetes.\nThere has been much research into diabetes. However, more is invested in making everyday life more comfortable for patients. The DON Foundation supports, and is actively in search of, ground-breaking research, with the aim of finding a complete cure for diabetes type 1. Every day we work hard to achieve this aim, but we have not yet found the solution.\nFacts and figures diabetes type 1\nIn The Netherlands, 100,000 people have diabetes type 1\nAbout 12,000 children until the age of 20 have diabetes type 1\nDiabetes type 1 cannot be cured. Diabetes type 1 is a chronic disease for which a cure still has not been found. The closest thing to curing it is transplanting the pancreas or the insulin-producing beta cells. But only a very small amount of patients are eligible for this. If you have diabetes type 1, you can have sugar. Diabetes may be commonly called 'sugar disease' in Dutch, but this does not mean that people with diabetes type 1 cannot have any sugar at all. Diabetes type 1 is unrelated to overweight. Even the thinnest people can get diabetes type 1. People with diabetes type 1 have high odds of complications. Diabetes can have a destructive effect on the body, especially on the large blood vessels, kidneys, eyes and nerves. The chances of complications increase the longer people have the disease. World Diabetes Day. Every year on November 14, World Diabetes Day is celebrated on the occasion of the birthday of Frederick Banting who, in 1922, together with Charles Best, formed the basis for the discovery of Insulin.\nSouthcentral KCTCS emergency medical technician\nInformation about Southcentral KCTCS emergency medical technician, registering for elective courses, and taking tests for free online.

Bao, the first recorded victim of Vohwinkel syndrome in Vietnam, lost all his fingers and toes to the rare disease. Photo by Ha Minh\nNguyen Hoang Gia Bao, 18, of Ho Chi Minh City is Vietnam's first recorded victim of Vohwinkel syndrome, a rare disease that ate away his fingers and toes by the time he was 10.\nBao, a resident of Thu Duc District, also has starfish-shaped patches of thickened skin on his arms and legs and thick, honeycomb-like calluses on the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet; as well as patches of infected skin.\nAfter 24 days of treatment, he was discharged from Cho Ray Hospital's Hematology Department on September 6, Suzanne Thanh Thanh, deputy head of the department told Vietweek on Monday.\nAccording to Thanh, Bao's health has stabilized and the itching and peeling from the calluses on his hands and feet have been reduced with a medication called acitretin. Bao confirmed his improvement to online newspaper Dan Tri on August 30, after just two days of treatment.\nHe will continue taking acitretin at home and once he is done with the treatment, he will undergo orthopedic surgery to give him prosthetic fingers and toes, Thanh said.\nT.T.L.H., 55, the younger sister of Bao's grandmother, said he started developing calluses when he was less than two months old. He was brought to different hospitals for treatment, but doctors failed to identify his disease and his family had difficulty paying for further visits because they were poor.\nH. said his fingers and toes became constricted by annular bands, which caused his knuckles to gradually deteriorate until they were gone.\nAfter eight years living without fingers and toes, Bao's left leg became swollen more than a month ago, at which point his family borrowed VND20 million (US$940) in order to have him treated at the HCMC Hospital of Dermatology and Venereology, she said.\nDoctor Thanh from Cho Ray Hospital's hematology department said Bao was transferred from HCMC Hospital of Dermatology and Venereology to her department on August 13 for treatment of anemia and thrombocytopenia (a decrease of platelets in blood).\nAbout two weeks later, Dr. Hoang Van Minh, a dermatology and venereology expert, diagnosed Bao as having Vohwinkel syndrome.\nH., Bao's relative, said no one else in Bao's family has the disease, and that his living environment is normal.\n\"Many times in my dreams, I saw myself with prosthetic arms and legs that enabled me to eat and go to the toilet on my own.\n\"I know my dream is a long shot, but I believe I will achieve it,\" he said, adding that he does not want to be a burden to his family.\nAccording to Minh, the syndrome was first discovered in 1929 by the German doctor after whom it was named. Only around 50 people have been confirmed to have contracted it worldwide and the disease occurs most often among Caucasian women.\nThe syndrome has two forms. The classic form, which is caused by mutations to the GJB2 (gap junction beta-2) gene, can include hearing loss.\nHe said Bao's symptoms on his arms and legs are typical of Vohwinkel.\nThanh and Minh said acitretin helps reduce Bao's itching and peeling of the outer skin, as well as reduce the thickness of the calluses and stop the swelling.\nwhat is diflucan - renxingyici.com\nHome » Online » what is diflucan\nMedical care is estimated to account for only 10-20% of healthcare outcomes. As a result, healthcare executives who wish to deliver high-quality care have to consider other elements that impact patient health, including income, access to healthcare, racial discrimination, adequate medication and dietary intake.\nThese are social determinants of health. They offer a wealth of information about non-clinical factors that have an impact on a patient's wellbeing. But identifying a patient's SDOH can be challenging because details aren't always easily accessible, especially at the time when clinicians make key treatment decisions.\nSDOH data often reside in EHRs, but are essentially trapped as unstructured text within clinical notes, patient-reported data, secure e-mail exchanges, where to buy generic bupropion supreme suppliers no prescription patient portal messages and other places.\nIn this interview with Healthcare IT News, Dr. Elizabeth Marshall, director of clinical analytics at AI-powered natural language processing vendor Linguamatics, talks about how healthcare providers can leverage AI technologies such as NLP to eliminate manual and time-consuming chart reviews to find critical patient information.\nQ. Please explain why SDOH are important today, where the data reside in the EHR and why they are difficult to work with.\nA. SDOH include the social, economic and environmental conditions that impact an individual's health and quality of life, and population health outcomes. Medical care is estimated to account for approximately 20% of healthcare outcomes, which is an important reason why healthcare leaders should consider SDOH factors and their impact on patient health.\nThe pandemic has highlighted how certain SDOH factors, including access to care, and work, and living conditions, have a disparate impact on health outcomes. We are also seeing lower COVID-19 vaccination rates among individuals who lack ready access to the Internet and public transportation.\n\"An estimated 80% of clinical data is stored in an unstructured format that is difficult to search and access. As a result, clinicians are often unaware of key SDOH details that impact decision-making and patient outcomes.\"\nWhile SDOH provides a wealth of information about nonclinical factors impacting a patient's overall wellbeing, identifying SDOH can be difficult for clinicians. SDOH data often resides in EHRs, but are essentially trapped as unstructured text within clinical notes, patient-reported data, patient portal messages and telehealth transcripts.\nIn fact, an estimated 80% of clinical data is stored in an unstructured format that is difficult to search and access. As a result, clinicians are often unaware of key SDOH details that impact decision-making and patient outcomes.\nQ: What is natural language processing and how does it work?\nA: NLP is a type of artificial intelligence that is concerned with the interactions between computers and human language. Using NLP, a computer can interpret the contents of documents, then extract information and insights.\nNLP-based text mining transforms the free (unstructured) text in documents and databases into normalized, structured data suitable for analysis or to drive machine learning algorithms. NLP text mining can rapidly identify facts, relationships and assertions that would otherwise remain buried in the mass of textual big data.\nOnce extracted, this information is converted into a structured form that can be further analyzed, or presented directly using clustered HTML tables, mind maps, charts, etc.\nQ: How exactly does NLP technology go through EHRs and find SDOH? And what does it do with the SDOH data?\nA: NLP allows providers to unlock SDOH from EHRs to gain a more complete picture of each patient's circumstances. A user can quickly create a query to extract key concepts and relationships from unstructured patient data to identify issues such as social isolation, transport problems and cultural factors that may impact health and outcomes.\nThe data can then be used with analytic tools, such as machine learning algorithms, predictive analytics and risk stratification models. In addition to using data to estimate the likelihood of future outcomes based on patterns in the historical data, healthcare organizations can use data to identify resource gaps, such as transportation issues that hinder a patient's ability to pick up medications at the pharmacy and attend their appointments.\nBased on identified SDOH issues, providers can develop new care programs, connect patients with additional resources, or offer other interventions that drive better patient outcomes.\nQ: What are end results? Please connect the dots.\nA: Using NLP, providers can identify patients at risk of poorer outcomes due to SDOH issues. With this insight, healthcare providers can then take proactive measures to connect patients with additional resources, which might include financial assistance for medication, educational materials to manage chronic diseases, or access to health screenings to identify underlying health conditions that could compromise health outcomes.\nSalvage therapy for relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: impact of prior rituximab. - Semantic Scholar\nmost common non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the developed world. Anthracycline based combination chemotherapy regimens became standard of care in the 1970s after a series of studies showed longterm disease free survival with this approach. It was the pivotal study by the Group d'Etude des Lymphomas de l'Adulte (GELA), comparing CHOP versus the same regimen plus rituximab that changed practice. The use of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 along with combination chemotherapy, CHOP or equivalent regimens led to complete remission (CR) rates of 75-80% and 3-5 year progression free survival (PFS) of 50-60%. Retrospective analysis of this strategy demonstrated that in adult DLBCL patients of all ages, 2-year OS increased from 52% with anthracycline based chemotherapy to 78% in the post-rituximab era. Despite this major advance, a significant proportion of patients will either experience early treatment failure, partial response or relapse after the initial chemotherapy. The initial approach to relapsed DLBCL management is to determine if the patient is a candidate for high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). In the PARMA trial, chemotherapy-sensitive relapsed DLBCL patients were randomized to salvage chemotherapy with platinum and cytarabine based regimen alone or in combination with ASCT. Both EFS and OS were significantly superior in the transplant group versus the chemotherapy alone group (46% and 53% vs. 12% and 32% respectively). Chemotherapy sensitive patients did significantly better than those who were chemotherapy-resistant (5year PFS 43% vs. 1-year survival of 22%). Based on these results, HDT/ASCT has become the standard of care in younger patients with chemosensitive relapsed or primary refractory aggressive lymphoma.\nDOI: 10.3324/haematol.2008.000984\nDiffuse large B-cell lymphoma: can genomics improve treatment options for a curable cancer?\nAmit Dipak Amin, Tara L Peters, +4 authors Jonathan H Schatz\nLoss of B-cell receptor expression defines a subset of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma characterized by silent BCR/PI3K/AKT signaling and a germinal center phenotype displaying low-risk clinicopathologic features.\nWei-Ge Wang, Wen-Li Cui, +5 authors Xiao-Qiu Li\nSustained durability of responses and improved progression-free and overall survival with imatinib treatment for accelerated phase and blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia: long-term follow-up of the STI571 0102 and 0109 trials.\nRichard T Silver, Jorge Cortes, Roger Waltzman, Manisha Mone, Hagop Kantarjian\nNovel and engineered anti-B-cell monoclonal antibodies for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\nPeter Martin, Richard R Furman, +5 authors John P Leonard\nAmrita Krishnan, Auayporn Nademanee, +8 authors Stephen J Forman\nAlejandro Martín, Eulogio Conde, +16 authors María-Dolores Caballero\nEdo Vellenga, Wim L J van Putten, +8 authors Peter C Huijgens\nFranck Morschhauser, Tim Illidge, +10 authors Robert Marcus\nIssa F Khouri, Rima M Saliba, +17 authors Richard E Champlin\nLaurie H Sehn, Jane Donaldson, +10 authors Joseph M Connors\n@article{Sud2008SalvageTF, title={Salvage therapy for relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: impact of prior rituximab.}, author={Rohit Sud and Jonathan W.

It is rare, accounting for 10%-20% of mesothelioma cases. Sarcomatous cells are resistant to treatment due to their spindle shape.\nWatch: Karen Selby, R.N. provides a quick overview of sarcomatoid mesothelioma and its treatment.\nThe Most Aggressive Cell Type\nSarcomatoid mesothelioma is the rarest and most challenging to treat variant of the disease's three primary tumor cell types. Compared to epithelial and biphasic mesothelioma, it is also the most aggressive and resistant to treatment. Inhaling asbestos fibers causes mutations in mesothelial cells that can develop into sarcomatoid mesothelioma.\nThe term sarcomatoid is the general classification for sarcomatous, spindle or diffuse malignant fibrous mesothelioma. Sarcomatoid tumors can merge to form a sheet-like, fibrous mass on the pleural membrane.\nTreating the spindle cell variant is more challenging than other types of mesothelioma because the tumor cells are resistant to therapy and quickly spread or metastasize to new areas.\nTumors with this cell type appear fibrous and diffuse throughout the pleura, the term for the pleural membrane surrounding the lungs and lining the chest cavity.\nThe characteristics of sarcomatoid cells make this variant of mesothelioma especially difficult to treat. Pathologists who specialize in mesothelioma are able to identify some of these rare cellular features when viewing tissue samples under a microscope.\nSpindle cells appear long, oval and spindle-shaped.\nThe center, or nucleus, of sarcomatoid cells is often enlarged and elongated. Some cells may have more than one nucleus.\nNearly all sarcomatoid mesotheliomas are pleural. There are fewer than 30 documented cases of sarcomatoid peritoneal mesothelioma.\n\"If you've been diagnosed with mesothelioma, I would encourage you to not look at those statistics and life expectancies and think that is your future. Everyone is different with this diagnosis. It's really important to speak to those specialists who deal with this disease to determine what your future is going to be.\"\nRegistered nurse and Patient Advocate at The Mesothelioma Center at Asbestos.com\nRare Sarcomatoid Mesothelioma Cell Subtypes\nEpithelial, biphasic and sarcomatoid are the three primary cell types of mesothelioma tumors. Within each variant, cells may have different characteristics that pathologists further classify into subtypes. There are three rare sarcomatoid mesothelioma cell subtypes.\nTransitional Mesothelioma: This variant tends to grow and spread in ways similar to other sarcomatoid mesotheliomas. It has fat, spindle-shaped cells, which helps pathologists differentiate it from other cells.\nLymphohistiocytoid Mesothelioma: These tumors contain inflammatory and immune cells. The lymphohistiocytoid variant makes up less than 1% of all mesotheliomas. Some patients with this cancer have a better-than-average life expectancy.\nDesmoplastic Mesothelioma: This sarcomatoid subtype is one of the most difficult to diagnose. Half or more of the tumor shows no discernible pattern of growth. Desmoplastic type accounts for approximately 5% of all mesotheliomas.\n\"Sarcomatoid cell types – these are slightly more aggressive tumors.\"\nBecause sarcomatoid mesothelioma is almost exclusively found in the pleural membrane, most patients experience nonspecific respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath. Common symptoms include:\nChest pain or abdominal fullness\nLack of appetite, anorexia and nausea\nPatients also commonly experience chest pain prior to diagnosis. As the disease progresses, symptoms become more serious. It's important to speak with a specialist about any history of first or possible secondhand asbestos exposure and symptoms as early as possible.\nMesothelioma is unfortunately often misdiagnosed because signs of the disease mimic other, less severe conditions.\nA 2018 study described a new approach for a more accurate sarcomatoid malignant mesothelioma diagnosis. Tests for the BAP1 and MTAP genes were 100% accurate for distinguishing sarcomatoid mesothelioma from fibrous pleuritis.\nHowever, since genetic testing for mesothelioma requires further clinical trials before widespread adoption, most doctors still favor traditional diagnostic methods.\nMisdiagnosing Sarcomatoid Mesothelioma\nPhysicians inexperienced with sarcomatoid mesothelioma tend to misdiagnose the disease as other types of thoracic or lung cancer.\nFibrous pleurisy or pleuritis\nSarcoma or fibrosarcoma\nMalignant fibrous histiocytoma (also called undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma)\nSolitary fibrous tumor of the pleura (hemangiopericytoma)\nSeeking a second opinion from a mesothelioma specialty team is essential for sarcomatoid patients because this group will include pathologists skilled in this diagnosis.\nAs part of the initial diagnostic procedure, doctors rule out causes of ongoing symptoms using physical exams and in-office testing. Then, they will order imaging studies such as X-rays, CT scans or MRIs. These tests reveal abnormalities in the chest, but they do not show specific details such as cell type.\nIf your imaging studies suggest cancer, your doctor will refer you for a biopsy where a surgeon collects a small tumor sample for analysis and identification under a microscope. Depending on the type of biopsy, physicians can obtain tumor tissue samples using a needle under CT scan guidance or in an outpatient procedure with anesthesia.\nSurgeons often use thoracoscopy or video-assisted thoracic surgery procedures to biopsy mesothelioma. These techniques result in high-quality tissue samples that can increase the chances of an accurate diagnosis.\nSpecific tests called immunohistochemistry reveal the cancer cell type and stage from a biopsy. Immunohistochemistry involves staining the cells using antibodies that attach to antigens on the tumor. This method indicates to pathologists whether the cancer is benign or malignant. These protein markers include calretinin, podoplanin, D2-40 and pan-cytokeratin.\nThe life expectancy for patients with sarcomatoid mesothelioma ranges from 4 to 18 months with treatment. Without treatment the median survival for patients with sarcomatoid tumors is typically less than six months.\nEach patient's prognosis differs based on the stage and location of the cancer and overall patient health.\nSarcomatoid cells are notoriously resistant to treatment because of their fibrous nature. Current treatments, however, have helped several patients with the lymphohistiocytoid cell subtype survive for up to four years, and one documented patient remained alive without symptoms 12 years after his diagnosis.\nIt's important to note that doctors use past data to make prognosis estimates. As treatment options improve and newer, cutting-edge therapies are employed, prognosis typically improves as well. Current survival rate statistics don't take this most recent data into account.\nClinical trials offer the best chance at improving prognosis and are available at specialized centers. Patients interested in the newest available therapies should seek treatment at a specialty mesothelioma treatment facility.\nThe best mesothelioma treatment options for the sarcomatoid cell type include immunotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy and radiation therapy. Patients should seek care from a mesothelioma specialist because sarcomatoid mesothelioma is harder to treat than the epithelioid or biphasic cell types.\nSurgeons generally do not operate on patients with this type of mesothelioma because sarcomatoid cancer cells tend to return within a few months of the procedure.\nThere is currently no cure for sarcomatoid or any other variant of mesothelioma. Treatment can improve cancer symptoms, extend survival and increase quality of life for many patients.\n\"There are many variants of mesothelioma, sarcomatoid being one of the rarest and potentially trickiest to treat. The Patient Advocates here at The Mesothelioma Center can assist the patient in connecting with a specialist who can successfully diagnose and also craft the best overall treatment plan based on the uniqueness of the patient's needs.\"\nPatient Advocate at The Mesothelioma Center\nNivolumab and ipilimumab, also known by the brand names Opdivo and Yervoy, are part of an FDA-approved immunotherapy combination for mesothelioma, including the sarcomatoid cell type.\nThis drug combination has improved the median overall survival of patients by four months compared to those receiving chemotherapy. It became the new first-line treatment for inoperable mesothelioma in 2020.\nIf immunotherapy stops working, the standard chemotherapy for treating pleural sarcomatoid mesothelioma is a combination of pemetrexed (Alimta) plus cisplatin or carboplatin. This treatment regimen is also the standard chemotherapy for patients with any cell type of malignant pleural mesothelioma.\nAZD8186 is an experimental targeted therapy drug that is effective with some cancers when combined with other targeted drugs or chemotherapy. Research in mice suggests a combination of AZD8186 and the targeted drug selumetinib may be successful in patients with sarcomatoid malignant mesothelioma.\nRadiation therapy is not considered curative for mesothelioma, but for patients with painful tumors penetrating the chest wall it can reduce pain and improve quality of life.\nA 2020 study published in Translational Lung Cancer Research confirms surgeons do not operate on patients with sarcomatoid mesothelioma because sarcomatoid tumors recur quickly after surgery.\nSarcomatoid tumors are rigid, and they often spread over large areas and into the chest wall, which makes it challenging to remove all cancerous cells through surgery. Similarly, in the abdomen, peritoneal mesothelioma tumors can grow into or encase the soft internal organs.\nSarcomatoid cancer cells tend to return quickly, even after extensive surgery, because it is harder to remove sarcomatoid tumors compared to epithelioid tumors. Patients with epithelioid tumors may live for years after surgery, where sarcomatoid patients tend to live for only a few months. Surgeons do not consider a few months enough of a survival benefit to justify the risks of surgery.\nIs sarcomatoid a type of mesothelioma?\nSarcomatoid mesothelioma is a variant of the disease that involves the rarest of three tumor cell types. Other mesothelioma tumor cell types include epithelial and biphasic, which describe the type of cells within a patient's tumor. Sarcomatoid mesothelioma cancer cells appear long and spindle-shaped, forming diffuse and fibrous tumors throughout the pleura.\nWhat do I need to know about sarcomatoid mesothelioma?\nSarcomatoid is the most aggressive and fastest spreading mesothelioma cell type and has the lowest average survival rate.\nIt makes up 10% to 20% of all mesothelioma cases.\nIt is more resistant to treatment than other types.\nHowever, clinical trials are testing new therapies for sarcomatoid mesothelioma that may be available to you through your physician.\nHow do I find a doctor who treats sarcomatoid mesothelioma?\nAll mesothelioma doctors have studied sarcomatoid mesothelioma and received training on how to treat this specific cell type. These specialists know the right kind of treatments and approaches that best control sarcomatoid mesothelioma. They also can connect you to clinical trials designed for patients with this cell type.\nSelby, K. (2022, June 2). Sarcomatoid Mesothelioma. Asbestos.com.

Tadalafil is an active ingredient of FDA-approved drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED), making these products unapproved drugs.\nThe undeclared active ingredient poses a threat to consumers because tadalafil may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs such as nitroglycerin and may lower blood pressure to unsafe levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease often take nitrates. To date, there have been no reported adverse events related to this recall.\nTendex is notifying its distributors and customers by direct mail or email and is arranging for return of all recalled products. Consumers that have product which is being recalled should stop using and return to place of purchase.\nConsumers with questions regarding this recall can contact Tendex by phone (800) 984-0341, from Monday to Friday, 9:00AM-5PM PST. Consumers should contact their physician or healthcare provider if they have experienced any problems that may be related to taking or using these drug products.\nPanel addresses stigmas of mental illness in the black community | WS Chronicle\tPanel addresses stigmas of mental illness in the black community - WS Chronicle\nIn photo above: Dr. Kimya Dennis leads the discussion as moderator of the community-wide mental health forum on Tuesday, May 12, in the RJR Auditorium at Winston-Salem State University. (Photos by Erin Mizelle for the Winston-Salem Chronicle)\nResidents and sorority and fraternity members took part in the 2015 Community-wide Mental Health Forum on Tuesday, May 12, so they could learn more about issues related to mental illness, especially when it relates to the African-American community.\nSome on the panel talked about the stigma of mental illness in the African-American community, and panelists discussed ways to overcome the stigma.\nThe forum was held at Winston-Salem State University's R.J. Reynolds Auditorium and was sponsored by the Winston-Salem Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc. and the Psi Phi Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc.\nKimya Dennis, an assistant professor and coordinator of criminal justice at Salem College, moderated the event.\nThe panel was comprised of psychiatrist Rahn Bailey, director of Behavioral Health from Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center; WSSU Nursing Instructor and Family Nurse Practitioner Daphne Sharpe; and Forsyth County District Court Judge Camille Banks-Payne, who sits on the bench in the county's Mental Health Treatment Court. Others on the panel were Louise Whealton, president of Northwest Piedmont chapter of the National Alliance of Mental Illness, and Kathy Cunningham, an advocate and peer support specialist who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.\nAsked how they would define mental illness, panelists said that it includes all forms of brain impairment and social disorders that create conflicts personally, in the family or at the job. Cunningham said that for her, dealing with mental illness can be challenging.\n\"Because it attacks your mind, your physical body takes a hit because you are not taking care of yourself at all. You don't want to and you don't want to be bothered,\" she said.\nBanks-Payne said that when your body is healthy, there are no limitations versus when it's not.\n\"You need your mind to be in a healthy state so you can function and be able to do the things that so many of us take for granted that if you're not mentally healthy, you would be impaired and not able to do that,\" Banks-Payne said.\nDennis broached the subject of how African-Americans deal with mental illness and how everyone will say that they have that \"crazy uncle.\" She said that she believes that it's part of the stigma of mental health and why many of those in the culture can't admit it so that they can get help.\nAll of the panelists agreed that there is a need to talk openly about mental health and use education to help everyone understand the illness or what that person is going through. They did have different ideas on how the thought process could be changed by bringing the issue to light and having others understand that it's serious.\nBanks-Payne said the religious community should be used as a platform.\n\"I think that sometimes there may be this view that there's a lack of faith if you get mental health treatment, or if you have a diagnosis you may have a demon. Those type of ideas are just out there,\" Banks-Payne said. \"The church is one of the main avenues we need to bring the subject up and bring some awareness because there are a lot of stigmas in the community about it.\"\nWhealton, a former teacher whose husband of 26 years was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, said that she feels that awareness about mental illness could be brought about in the school systems.\n\"I think if all people sat in a classroom and heard information, it would begin a generation of something else, like learning the symptoms of a stroke of how to know when your grandaddy's having a heart attack,\" Whealton said.\nSharpe said that it needs to become more common for both women and men to have routine mental health and depression screening when they go to their primary doctors.\nBailey said, that having been the director of a behavioral hospital before, he knows firsthand that the government and legislators rarely fund those institutions to the point that it can create a positive impact and reverse the thought of it not being as important as other illnesses.\n\"I think were there adequate financing behind mental illness, the stigma would change,\" Bailey said.\nFor more information on mental illness and programs in the area, visit the Mental Health Association of Forsyth County website at www.triadmentalhealth.org or call them at 336-768-3880.\nAfrican American communityDr. Kimya Dennisfeaturedmental illnessWinston-SalemWinston-Salem Alumnae Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority Inc.Winston-Salem Psi Phi Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc.Winston-Salem State University\nBeyond Pesticides Daily News Blog » Blog Archive » Researchers Find Key Link in Malaria Transmission\nWordPress.org\t« Survey Shows Consumers Confused by USDA Organic, Want Both Local and Organic\nSchool Districts Call for Reduced Pesticide Use in Florida »\n04\tSep Researchers Find Key Link in Malaria Transmission\n(Beyond Pesticides, September 4, 2007) Scientists identified an important biochemical piece in the passage of malaria from mosquitoes to humans. If this link in the chain can be broken at its source—the mosquito—then the spread of malaria could be stopped without the use of harmful pesticides or costly drugs.\n\"Mosquito Heparan Sulfate and Its Potential Role in Malaria Infection and Transmission,\" published in the August 31 issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry, contains the findings of the interdisciplinary team led by researchers from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The research group found that humans and the mosquitoes that carry the malaria parasite Plasmodium share the same complex carbohydrate, heparan sulfate. In both humans and mosquitoes, heparan sulfate is a receptor for the Plasmodium, binding to the parasite and giving it quick and easy transport through the body.\nRobert J. Linhardt, Ph.D., professor of Biocatalysis and Metabolic Engineering at Rensselaer, led the team. \"The discovery allows us to think differently about preventing the disease. If we can stop heparan sulfate from binding to the parasite in mosquitoes, we will not just be treating the disease, we will be stopping its spread completely,\" Dr. Linhardt said.\nMalaria parasites are specific to their host, Dr. Linhardt explained. Birds, rodents, humans, and other primates all can be infected with malaria, but each species is infected by a different species of mosquito — and each of those mosquitoes is infected by a different parasite. In other words, there needs to be a perfect match at the molecular basis for malaria to spread from one species to another, Dr. Linhardt said. Researchers have long understood this deadly partnership, but the molecular basis for the match had never been determined.\nDr. Linhardt and his collaborators were the first to discover the link between the spread of malaria in humans and heparan sulfate in 2003. Those findings were also published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry. In this earlier study, Linhardt compared the receptors in the liver of humans to those of rodents. The liver is the first organ to be infected by the malaria parasite in mammals. The researchers found that heparan sulfate in the human liver was the unwitting transporter of the disease to the human bloodstream. The receptor found in rodents was a different heparan sulfate.\n\"The discovery marks a paradigm shift in stopping malaria,\" Dr. Linhardt said \"Now, we can work to develop an environmentally safe, inexpensive way to block infection in mosquitoes and not have to worry about drug side effects in humans.\"\nMalaria kills over one million people a year around the world, mostly young children. And the problem is growing, Dr. Linhardt noted. As the global temperatures increase, outbreaks of malaria are being reported higher up the coast of South America and Mexico each year, he said.\n\"Unfortunately, there is little direct funding on malaria in this country outside of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, because it is not considered a major threat in this country,\" Dr. Linhardt said. \"We do our research on a shoestring. Malaria research funding needs to move higher up on the scientific priority list.\"\nThe discovery comes one year after the World Health Organization (WHO) announced it supported the indoor use of DDT to control the spread of malaria in developing countries. Governmental agencies in the U.S. and internationally have classified DDT as an agent that can cause cancer and nerve damage, and a host of health effects are well documented. The new research may lead to an effective system of malaria control that is not reliant on harmful chemical compounds."

Dispelling mental health myths and raising awareness of the skills needed to manage personal emotional health and support those in need are integral to our approach.\nThat's why we've introduced the Mental Health First Aider role in our London office, complementing our existing benefit and resource offerings. We trained 15 employees to help promote an open mental health culture by providing a listening ear and offering guidance on finding further support, should employees need it.\nWe spoke to four Bloomberg employees recently trained as Mental Health First Aiders on the new skills they've learned, how we can remove the stigma around mental health, and simple tips for taking care of our mental health.\nMadeeha Ahmad (top left), Alex Burkie (top right), Adam Bonehill (bottom left) and Alex Toft (bottom right)\nWhat did you learn in the training that challenged your perception of mental health issues?\nAlex Burkie: Like many people, I tend to gravitate to one or two well-known conditions when I hear the phrase 'mental health'. It was interesting to discover the full spectrum of mental health issues is much broader than I previously realised.\nMadeeha Ahmad: I came away with an awareness that mental health is as much a continuum as physical health. There are many triggers in our daily lives which can impact our mental health, some sudden and severe in magnitude, while others build over time. With this in mind it becomes even more important that we actively take care of both our physical and mental well-being, and are open to supporting those suffering from ill health.\nWhat do you think is attributing to the stigma surrounding mental health that prevents people from seeking treatment?\nAlex Burkie: People still tend to worry about how they'll be perceived if they're open about their experience of mental health, which can impact their ability to ask for help. However, I also feel a gradual change is taking place in society, it's becoming more acceptable to speak up about your own mental health.\nMadeeha Ahmad: While we live in more open minded and tolerant times, there are definitely misconceptions around mental health issues and a fear of having a particular label which can contribute to people delaying in seeking treatment.\nWhat can be done to remove the stigma surrounding mental health?\nMadeeha Ahmad: We all have a role to play in removing the stigma around mental health issues and a large part of that is down to better education and awareness. In recent years, many public figures have become involved in raising awareness and this has helped bring this issue to people's attention.\nStarting small, by paying attention to the language we use in every day conversations can have an impact on people's perceptions. Sharing our own mental health experiences encourages an open and supportive atmosphere, and although taking the first step can be scary – it can have a powerful impact. It's great to see organisations such as ours investing in, promoting good mental health, and supporting those with ill mental health.\nWhat should people do if they themselves are experiencing mental health issues?\nMadeeha Ahmad: Speak to someone about it – don't ever feel like your problem is too small or too trivial. There are so many options, from family, friends and trusted co-workers to our emergency reps in HR and now also our very own group of Mental Health First Aiders. We're here to listen and provide support in seeking appropriate professional help.\nWhat advice would you give to someone who wants to support a friend, partner or family member experiencing mental health issues?\nAlex Burkie: While we should never be expected to 'fix' an issue, we can all be someone who consciously stands strong beside a friend, partner or family member. Your support, encouragement and re-assurance can have a lasting impact. Whether that starts with simply listening with an open mind and helping someone talk through what they're experiencing, or supporting them in finding professional help, we can all do something to make a difference.\nWhat are a few things someone can do to support their mental health?\nAlex Toft: Learn to check in with your feelings regularly. Start by asking yourself if what you are experiencing is having a negative impact on your mental wellbeing – and if it is, what can you do to change that? Spend a minimum of 15 mins every day doing one thing that makes you happy!\nMore information calms, but also spurs doubts. Patients have a sense that they are becoming more in tune with their overall health, but they link the information to their heart disease, for which there is no safe basis. For example, if they see that they aren't sleeping as much as they should be, they become uncomfortable and fear that this may exacerbate their illness. Similarly, they often link fast hearts rate with an increased risk of heart attack. \"Conversely, the Fitbit watch can be calming, if data shows that you are sleeping well and have a low heart rate. The problem is that you cannot use data directly related to heart disease because the watch is designed for sports and wellness, as opposed to managing disease,\" explains Tariq Osman Andersen.\nPatients gain the courage to exercise, while simultaneously experiencing feelings of guilt. Another aspect of the Fitbit watch with both positive and negative aspects, is exercise. On one hand, patients were motivated to be active, but at the same time, the app revealed when patients did not attain the recommended 10,000 daily steps, which made many of them feel guilty.\n\"We believe it is time to think in terms of 'collaborative care,' where both patient and clinicians benefit from the new health data and are thereby able to work together to manage and treat chronic diseases. This requires that we create a digital platform in which clinicians and patients can jointly interpret data from, for example, fitness watches, without creating unnecessary additional work for clinicians,\" concludes Tariq Osman Andersen.\nMore information: Tariq Osman Andersen et al, Experiences With Wearable Activity Data During Self-Care by Chronic Heart Patients: Qualitative Study, Journal of Medical Internet Research (2020).

The discomfort generally starts in the huge toe as well as relocates down the other toes, making the client feel as if they are being torn apart. Gout assaults usually repeat, creating the person a lot of pain. Do Antibiotics Work For Gout\nThere are several medical therapies that can be provided for gout pain.

Therefore it is essential to understand each one and pick the best medical treatment according to the signs and symptoms and issues that the individual is experiencing. Many people have actually uncovered that the most effective means to treat their gout arthritis involves utilizing different all-natural self-management approaches.Do Antibiotics Work For Gout\nGout arthritis is caused by a health problem called hyperuricemia, in which there is way too much uric acid in the body. The kidneys make excessive uric acids in the blood, which are then transferred in the bones, ligaments as well as various other joints. In addition to the large toe, usual joints that are frequently affected are the joint, ankle joint, as well as also the wrist. This condition is more common amongst guys than females, but it can take place at any type of age. The major threat factors for gout arthritis are obesity, alcohol abuse, smoking cigarettes, high blood pressure, inadequate diet regimen as well as eating routines and a family history of the disease. Do Antibiotics Work For Gout\nGout as well as arthritis are linked due to the fact that numerous way of living elements, such as excess weight, high blood pressure, bad diet and also lack of physical activity, can bring about the advancement of the joint condition. Thus a gout person should change his/her life style so as to avoid the risk elements, while at the same time attempting to minimize the symptoms as well as complications of the joint inflammation. For this purpose the gout patient should embrace a positive attitude.

Using NSAIDS or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as pain killers, ibuprofen, naproxen, and so on, is encouraged in order to control the swelling in the joint. One more alternative is to take the prescription lotion or the oral tablet computer of the advised dosage of the medication. While carrying out these self-management techniques it is important to bear in mind that the gout attack can return if the medicine is stopped abruptly; so it is best to walk gradually and also carefully with these drugs.\nAnother choice to control the attack is by stopping the consumption of all medicines except the NSAIDS. You must see your doctor to start taking the NSAIDS every day. You need to not quit taking your other drugs all of a sudden, as this might also lead to withdrawal signs and raise the threat of an attack returning. Furthermore you need to consult your medical professional about the feasible withdrawal negative effects, like nausea, vomiting, indigestion, sleepiness, headache as well as dizziness. He may likewise advise an alternate treatment for your condition other than NSAIDS.\nGout and also NSAIDS and their connection are something that you need to discuss completely with your medical professional. There are several natural herbs that might decrease uric acid degrees in the blood stream and lower the risk of gout pain attacks. One such natural herb that is commonly suggested by holistic physicians and nutritional experts is Milk Thistle. Milk Thistle can be absorbed supplement form or as a tea. It has been revealed to avoid the development of uric acids by combating the enzymes that cause purine metabolic process. Research studies have actually likewise revealed that by taking Milk Thistle daily the danger of gout arthritis and its signs are decreased by practically fifty percent.\nTo help reduce inflammation as well as relieve discomfort associated with gout, clients are recommended to take a cup of ginger juice per day.

The STRC will receive updates on suicide prevention, appointment of the American Indian Health Director at the Department of Public Health and Human Services, Senate Bill 261 revenue triggers, and the 2016 American Indian Student Achievement Data Report.\nOn April 22, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) said, “To be clear, WHO’s advice is to find and test every suspected case, not every person in a population.”\nWhile testing every person is not essential to controlling COVID-19, finding and testing every suspected case is. As the COVID-19 outbreak sweeps across the globe, the world turns to laboratories for answers. Laboratory scientists are responding by providing doctors with ways to diagnose COVID-19 and by pursuing the development of a vaccine that could someday stop the pandemic in its tracks. Until a vaccine is found, social distancing and testing are the best ways to control the spread of the disease.\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus, now named SARS-CoV-2, has sickened millions of people with COVID-19. By the end of April 2020, the United States had by far the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University.\nTesting is the only way to determine the case fatality rate (CFR), which is the ratio between confirmed deaths and confirmed cases. Testing is also the best way to assess the overall effectiveness of preventive measures and vaccines. Determining the CFR requires time and reliable data to confirm cases and deaths based on trusted laboratory testing. Strict adherence to proven and accepted laboratory protocols provides the most accurate data possible.\nManaging Laboratory Protocols during the COVID-19 Outbreak\nManaging laboratory protocols during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is challenging because, as with the outbreak of any novel virus, researchers are entering uncharted territories. Virologists had a limited understanding of transmission patterns, clinical features, severity, and risk factors for COVID-19 infection at the start of the pandemic. To address those unknowns, WHO established Four Early Investigation Protocols, which are now known as the WHO Unity Studies.\nThe protocols rapidly and systematically collect and store data that will be critical in refining recommendations for case definition and surveillance, and for characterizing the key epidemiological features of COVID-19. The protocols will also help the medical community gain a greater understanding of the spread, severity and spectrum of the disease, as well as its impact on the community. Information gained from the data will help guide countermeasures, such as case isolation and contact tracing.\nRapid detection of COVID-19 cases is essential for controlling the emergence of this rapidly spreading illness and for understanding the key epidemiological features of the disease, but rapid detection requires wide availability of diagnostic testing.\nWithin a month of the first outbreak in China, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed a real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test that can diagnose COVID-19. The CDC provides instructions for the use of real-time rT-PCR assays for the in vitro qualitative detection of coronavirus in sera and respiratory specimens. FIND also maintains a list of SARS-CoV-2 tests in development or commercially available for COVID-19, and WHO maintains a list of COVID-19 in-house PCR protocols assays.\nChallenges of managing laboratory protocols\nEven with reliable assays, managing laboratory protocols during COVID-19 is challenging. The pandemic has disrupted the supply chain for many laboratories, for example. Personal protection equipment (PPE) is scarce, for example, and there have been shortages of SARS-CoV-2 PCR reagents.\nBiosafety is also a major concern, as keeping lab workers safe is a high priority. The CDC has released biosafety guidelines for labs working with Coronavirus: Interim Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines for Handling and Processing Specimens Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). These guidelines include essential information on virus isolation, waste management, and decontamination. The EPA also released an expanded COVID-19 disinfectant list on March 13, 2020, but social distancing is far more effective than disinfection for controlling viral transmission. Unfortunately, social distancing is much more difficult than disinfection in a typical laboratory, where technicians work side by side and in close proximity to specimens.\nWhile the protocols are far from perfect, and disruptions in the supply chain can slow testing, laboratory protocols will continue to play an important role in preventing the spread of COVID-19 until a vaccine is found.\nPursuit of a COVID-19 Vaccine\nThe best way to defeat COVID-19 is to develop a vaccine, of course, but vaccine development can often take 10 to 15 years. Vaccines for respiratory viruses are also elusive. Two toddlers died in 1966 from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), for example, and vaccines for the parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) and metapneumovirus (MPVs) are still not available.\nThere are 120 projects working towards a vaccine; only five have received approval for clinical trials in humans. University of Oxford researchers began Phase I human trials of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in late April. In this trial, half of the roughly 1100 participants receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, while the control group receives the common meningitis vaccine, MenACWY. The first two volunteers, one from the test group and one from the control, received their inoculations on April 23, 2020.\nFast tracking the development of this vaccine or others could potentially save thousands or millions of lives, providing the vaccine undergoes sufficient testing to ensure its safety and efficacy. It is possible to get a licensed vaccine in one and a half to two years, and even possible to get a vaccine into use much sooner. Reliable laboratory testing will help researchers determine if their vaccines are working.\nMany of the battles against the COVID-19 outbreak will be fought in laboratories in the United States and around the world. Widespread testing will play an important role in reducing deaths associated with coronavirus and improving the health and well-being of people across the globe.\nTo View Frank Magliochetti Press Releases Please CLICK HERE\nFrank Magliochetti owes his professional success to his expertise in two areas: medicine and finance.

Elder abuse intervention research is constrained by a lack of research capacity, including sensitive and responsive outcome measures that can assess change in case status over the course of intervention. Given the heterogeneous nature of elder abuse, standard scales can lack the flexibility necessary to capture the diverse range of individually relevant issues across cases. In this paper, we seek to address this gap by proposing the adaptation and use of an innovative measurement strategy—goal attainment scaling—in the context of elder protection. Goal attainment scaling is an individualized, client-centered outcome measurement approach that has the potential to address existing measurement challenges constraining progress in elder abuse intervention research.\nPredicting Help-Seeking Attitudes Toward Mental Health Services Among American Indian Older Adults: Is Andersens Behavioral Model a Good Fit? 30/11/16\nPatterns of Shelter Use Among Men New to Homelessness in Later Life: Duration of Stay and Psychosocial Factors Related to Departure 30/11/16\nPeople who become homeless for the first time in late life are a growing but understudied population. This study draws on administrative data from one shelter (N = 1,214 first-time homeless) to assess the extent to which age is related to shelter stay and, to examine psychosocial factors that may be associated with shelter departure. Our bivariate and survival analysis results suggest that older homeless men stay in the shelter 2 weeks longer than younger clients. Older men with pending legal issues and mobility concerns were more likely to leave the shelter than those without such concerns. Findings highlight the impact of age and other psychosocial variables on shelter stay, and provide direction from which to address homelessness among men who are new to homelessness in later life.\nDeterminants of Job Satisfaction and Turnover Intent in Home Health Workers: The Role of Job Demands and Resources 30/11/16\nBased on the job demands–resources (JD-R) model, this study explored the impact of job demands (physical injury and racial/ethnic discrimination) and resources (self-confidence in job performance and recognition by supervisor/organization/society) on home health workers' employee outcomes (job satisfaction and turnover intent). Using data from the National Home Health Aide Survey (N = 3,354), multivariate models of job satisfaction and turnover intent were explored. In both models, the negative impact of demands (physical injury and racial/ethnic discrimination) and the positive impact of resources (self-confidence in job performance and recognition by supervisor and organization) were observed. The overall findings suggest that physical injury and discrimination should be prioritized in prevention and intervention efforts to improve home health workers' safety and well-being. Attention also needs to be paid to ways to bolster work-related efficacy and to promote an organizational culture of appreciation and respect.\nSocial Support and \"Playing Around\": An Examination of How Older Adults Acquire Digital Literacy With Tablet Computers 30/11/16\nThis study examines how older adults learn to use tablet computers. Learning to use new technologies can help older adults to be included in today's digital society. However, learning to use new technologies is not always easy, especially for older adults. This study focuses on how older adults learn to use a specific technology, tablet computers, and the role that social support plays in this process. Data for this project are from 21 in-depth interviews with individuals who own tablet computers. We examine how older adults engage with tablet devices and increase their digital literacy. The findings suggest that, for older adults to start to use tablets, social support plays an important role. In addition, a key way that many participants report gaining expertise with the technology is through \"playing around\" with the tablets. Suggestions for how to help older adults learn to use new technologies are detailed.\nIf these sensations and causes are present, a doctor should order an MRI or CT scan and surgery should follow. Treatment and full recovery are possible if it is diagnosed early enough. If not, paralysis is imminent."

        "description": "lung cancer symptoms are the number one cause of cancer death in the United States in both men and women it is the second most common cause of cancer. lung cancer symptoms I'm going to give an overview of I'll talk about the leading causes of the symptoms the staging and the treatments. Keep. If you have not done so already so you'll know what I'm doing do you see it live that's where you could ask me questions in real-time but I do I live she would say The most important risk factor for developing lung cancer is smoking cigarettes what is the creator of Mickey Mouse and all things Disney was a smoker and he developed lung cancer? However, you can be a nonsmoker and still get lung cancer. Diana reed was an actor a singer in the wife of Superman Christopher\nShe developed lung cancer and she had never smoked a cigarette in her life so what exactly is lung cancer occurs when lung cells change or mutate and they begin growing and dividing uncontrollably as these mutated cancer cells stacked upon one another form a mass or tumor. If cancer cells from this tumor break off and get into the bloodstream you can develop metastatic lung cancer. There are 2 main types of lung cancer small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer nonsmall cell lung cancer makes up about 85 percent of lung cancers and there are 4 types of non-small cell lung cancer squamous cell carcinoma adenocarcinoma carcinoid tumor in large cell lung cancer what are the leading cause of lung cancer. Well, smoking tobacco is the leading cause of developing lung cancer 90 percent of people with lung cancers are smokers or former smokers.\nSecondhand smoke also puts you at risk for developing so if you're living with a smoker you have an increased risk for your parents who smoke cigarettes in front of their children yes you are increasing your child's risk of developing lung cancer other causes include environmental exposures if you have been exposed to things like asbestos radon certain metals like arsenic and chromium, this can increase your chances of developing lung cancer also if you had a type of cancer in the past and you've received radiation therapy. That radiation exposure can also increase your risk for developing lung cancer the symptoms of lung cancer. This is lung cancer that can be vast they can be calls from the direct pressure of cancer on organs organ systems they can be caused by the lung cancer invading blood vessels or compressing nerves the symptoms can also be caused by a plastic syndrome or you can get sometimes from organs even when cancer itself has not directly spread to those working. One common symptom it's a cough cough acid reflux\nit's a very common symptom of lung cancer it occurs in over 75 percent of patients with lung cancer hemoptysis is another symptom hi marks this is is the coughing up of blood and it often occurs in the lung cancer has invaded blood vessels another symptom of lung cancer shortness of breath. Also, you can get chest pain a hoarse voice the superior vena cava syndrome can also lead to symptoms and lung cancer. The superior vena cava syndrome or the syndrome occurs when the lung cancer causes an obstruction or blockage to the flow of the superior vena capable of that very large vessel returning blood to the heart symptoms include facial swelling neck\nswelling shortness of breath. And several symptoms can be caused by these neoplastic syndrome symptoms can include high blood pressure weight game developing around or a moon phase you can get weakness bone pain kidney stones depending on the pier neoplastic syndrome you may develop. So what is the treatment for lung cancer? The treatment depends on the staging of the lung cancer in the type of lung cancer for small cell lung cancer most of the time by the time the small cell lung cancer is discovered it has already spread it over 60 percent of cases and in that case, there will be a role for chemotherapy and radiation. In general, there are 4 stages of lung cancer. pneumonia\n3 cancer has spread outside of the low in lymph nodes have been found to have lung cancer in the mediastinum are out in the center of the chest and in that sub corona area or that area that's right underneath the windpipe or the trachea. In this case, when cancer has already spread into the middle of the chest the mediastinum surgery has a limited role or no role in chemotherapy as a treatment for stage 3 lung cancer in stage for lung cancer. Cancer has spread outside of the loans in outside the chest so beyond having a spot of lung cancer in the lungs it has spread beyond being local it has spread beyond the media signed with a chest it is now outside of the lines in the system it is metastatic some popular places for a long time cancers metastasize and stage 4 include the bones the liver and the brain. read more\nElmhurst Gum Disease Dentist Warns Patients About the Dangers of Untreated Periodontal Disease - Dr. Scharfenberg\nSkip to main content\nFamily Dentistry\nDental Implants\nCosmetic Dentistry\nVeneers\nTMJ\nRelaxation Dentistry\nInvisalign\nCovid-19\nMeet Our Dentists\nPatient Reviews\nBlog\nContact\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYelp\nContact Us for a Complimentary Smile Consultation\n(630) 733-1624 Schedule Online\nElmhurst Gum Disease Dentist Warns Patients About the Dangers of Untreated Periodontal Disease\nWritten by Dr. Scharfenberg on Mar 8, 2013\nView all articles\nAre you doing everything you can to keep your teeth in tip-top shape? You may be brushing regularly, even whitening with cosmetic products, but are you paying enough attention to your gum tissue? Few patients are, which is why our Elmhurst dentists have put together this article about the importance of gum health. With diligent and proactive care, you can keep the foundation of your smile strong and beautiful. Read on to learn what we mean…\nYour gum tissue is the foundation of your smile. When your gum tissue is damaged due to gum disease it can cause your teeth to weaken, and even your bone tissue to deteriorate. Gum disease silently destroys oral health—this disease can go undiagnosed and untreated for years, because it’s often asymptomatic. It’s critical, therefore, to see a professional dentist regularly so that they can monitor you for periodontal disease.\nGum disease not only weakens dental enamel, it also causes inflammation of the oral tissues. Chronic inflammation wreaks havoc on your oral health and your overall wellbeing. This is why untreated periodontal disease has been linked to a host of chronic illnesses, including:\n· Diabetes\n· Heart disease\n· High cholesterol\n· Hardened arteries\n· Stroke\nTo keep your mouth healthy, and to minimize your risk of chronic whole-body illnesses, you should take care of your gums at home and in the dentist’s office. Clear bacteria and plaque off of your gum tissue—using gentle tools like floss and a soft toothbrush, so as not to injure your gums. An antibacterial mouth rinse may boost your gum health as well.\nWhen you prioritize your gum health you lay the foundation for a healthy smile, long-term. Talk to our Elmhurst dentists about what you can do day to day for your gum tissue. We help patients get the periodontal treatment they need and avoid gum problems with preventative dentistry.\n7 reasons why good sleep is important - Companion4health\n7 Reasons why good sleep is important\nWhat we do when we are awake makes all the difference to our lives. How we live our lives, who we help, who we love, what we eat is all a part of our waking lives.\nBut you know what is equally important to our waking lives? Sleep. Yes, sleep is as important and essential to live healthy and creative lives. Today many of us work late hours and don't get enough sleep.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an adult needs about 7-8 hours of sleep every night. But in today's fast paced modern world, we have forgotten to rest and get a good night's sleep.\nThe lack of sleep causes many health and psychosomatic disorders in the human body. And the benefits of getting a good night's sleep are endless.\nHere are 11 reasons why good sleep is important:\nDuring sleep our mind and body experience a deep relaxation. We do not expend any energy while we are asleep. Instead, we preserve energy and rebuild on the energy e expended during the day.\nA good night's sleep restores us energy on all levels. It regenerates our tired body, mind and soul. This is why when you are having a tough day, you might've been told to 'sleep it off'.\nIt's because sleep replenishes and restores our energy and state of mind. Sleep is the best refreshment for a hard day.\nThere is no doubt that getting a good night's sleep for 8 hours contributes to maintaining healthy weight.\nAccording to research, people who sleep for short durations show more signs of weight gain than people who get a good night's sleep. Proper sleep also helps in digestion.\nYou might've noticed that when you havent slept well, your digestion may be off the next day. This is because your body did not get the necessary 'off time' to digest the food.\nAnd bad digestion can result in weight gain. Sleeping for at least 8 hours a night, is one of the best ways to loose weight, improve digestion and gut health.\nGetting a good night's sleep naturally keep your mind sharper the next day. When you don't get enough sleep, your mind naturally feels cloudy and unfocused.\nResults of a study show that interns who had to work for more than 24 hours made more medical errors than interns who were allowed to sleep.\nIt is only when the mind and body is fully rested, restored and relaxed can we concentrate and focus to our full capacity.\nToday many of us face mental health issues. But what is not widely known is that, sleep is one of the major factors that contributes in propagating depression.\nA research on sleep and depression, suggests that approximately 90 per cent of people who suffer from depression complain about sleep issues. They cannot fall asleep faster or cannot stay asleep for long.\nAnother research also suggests that sleep disorder are at the core of depression. Depression feeds sleep disorders and vice versa. So what can be done? The cycle needs to be broken by getting a good night's sleep.\nOne of the most important reasons why good sleep is important is because it boosts immunity. A rested body and mind is a healthy body and mind.\nSleep and rest weakens the harmful bacteria in the body there by boosting immune function. Good sleep also produces a positive cellular immune response in the body.\nAccording to a research, those who slept for less than 7 hours were more like to get a cold or fever than those who slept for more than 8 hours.\nInflammation is the swelling or reddening of a body part. It is one of the leading causes of diseases and disorders and one of the reasons why good sleep is important.\nInflammation occurs on the surface of the body and even inside on the organs.\nOur circadian rhythm is our body's clock and determines our sleep patterns. Sleep and inflammation in the body are both regulated by our circadian rhythms.\nWhen we don't get enough sleep, it causes a negative immune response thereby increasing inflammation inside the body. With good sleep and on track circadian rhythms, inflammation also comes under control.\nA good night's sleep relaxes and heals an agitated nervous system. Lack of sleep disrupts the nervous system and causes issues like anxiety, paranoia and stress in our waking lives.\nWhen we have a calm nervous system, we feel peaceful, grounded and balanced. From this balanced state of mind, we can make sound decisions and judgements.\nOne of the reasons why good sleep is important is because a good night's sleep relaxes the nervous system. Which is why when you sleep for more than 8 hours and wake up, you feel calm and refreshed the next day.\nNot only will a good night's sleep improve your memory recall, it will also boost your creativity. There are many reasons to this.\nWhen we sleep, we dream. And our dream space is a creative space. That is why many shamans advice us to work with our dreams and listen to the messages we receive in our dreams.\nOur dreams are where our creative selves emerge.

Whether you have HF or know someone who does, here is a guide to the basics.\nHeart failure (HF) is a complex syndrome with physiological signs and symptoms that develop when the heart is not functioning properly. A heart failure diagnosis, according to established guidelines, is based on several criteria including the presence of symptoms and evidence of cardiac dysfunction on diagnostic tests, and/or a favorable response to treatment.1 Click here to read more.\nHeart failure can be classified by the time and speed of onset, which side(s) of the heart is affected, the heart's pumping ability (ejection fraction), and/or a patient's response to treatment. Click here to read more.\nHeart failure can present differently in everyone, but some of the most common symptoms are dyspnea (shortness of breath with activity), fatigue and weakness, persistent coughing, edema (swelling), orthopnea (shortness of breath while lying down), heart palpitations, nausea, and confusion. Click here to read more.\nHeart failure is often diagnosed after other conditions are ruled out. It is important to communicate the timeline of your symptoms with your healthcare provider who will likely want to learn your medical history. There are numerous diagnostic tests - blood work, urinalysis, imaging tests, etc. - that can help clarify what is going on in your body. Early diagnosis can lead to better long-term outcomes. Click here to read more.\nHeart failure treatments help delay the condition's progression over time. Treatment selection depends on heart failure type, cause, symptoms, and severity. The most common treatment options include lifestyle changes, medications, and surgery. Click here to read more.\nLike most conditions, heart failure has a number of potential causes and risk factors. Causes can include comorbidities (other health conditions) and past health events while risk factors include age, ethnicity, race, and socioeconomic status. Click here to read more.\nOver 5 million Americans and 25 million people globally are estimated to have heart failure. Given the aging global population, experts predict the number of heart failure patients to rise in the coming decades.

Thirty months after the transplant, multiple tests indicate there is “no return of the virus.”\nAt this stage, the virus is considered to be in remission. Specialists in the field suggest a three- to four-year period to confidently confirm the cure.\nA possible third case was recently announced on March 6 at a conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections held in Seattle. The “Dusseldorf patient” has shown no signs of infectious HIV more than three months after discontinuing antiviral medications. There are six other HIV-infected patients who have received bone marrow transplants from donors resistant to the virus and might in the future be deemed cured.\nHIV is a sexually transmitted virus and the precursor to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), one of the most widespread and deadly diseases on the planet. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 36.9 million people worldwide are infected with HIV/AIDS and that an additional 1.8 million individuals become newly infected each year, approximately 5,000 new cases per day.\nTimothy Ray Brown, initially known as the “Berlin patient,” was considered the first HIV-infected patient to be cured. Brown had acquired HIV in 1995 while attending university in Berlin. For 10 years he remained well on antiviral medications that kept the infection in check. In 2005 he developed acute myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the blood cells that develops in the marrow of the bones. This leads to symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue and can be rapidly fatal without treatment.\nInitially, he underwent chemotherapy, which put the cancer into remission. As a precaution, Brown’s oncologist obtained a blood sample to test for a possible stem cell transplant as a next option in case the remission was of short duration. Most patients won’t find a donor match, but fortuitously for Brown, he had 267 matches, which led his doctors to consider finding a donor with recently identified mutations in their white blood cells that make them resistant to HIV infection. (This inherited mutation is called CCR5 delta 32 and is discussed below.)\nWhen the leukemia rebounded in late 2006, Brown decided to go ahead with the transplant. Such medical procedures are, however, complex and carry significant and potentially lethal complications. They are generally only used after more conventional treatments for cancer have already failed. He stopped his antiviral medications, and within three months the HIV was no longer found in his bloodstream.\nIn Brown’s case, his leukemia recurred a year later, and he underwent a second transfer with the same donor. Complications with the second procedure included severe brain injury that left him nearly blind and paralyzed with a prolonged but eventually full recovery.\nAs a result of the two bone marrow transplants, however, Brown has since remained free of HIV.\nThe white blood cells searched for by Brown’s doctors are those with a mutation to their CCR5 receptor on CD4+ T-cells. These cells, helper T-cells that express the CD4 protein on their surface, assist other white blood cells by regulating immune responses to an assortment of infections or pathogens. Helper T-cells are infected by HIV when the virus uses a combination of the CCR5 protein and the CD4 receptor to infiltrate the cell, in turn disrupting the coordinated functioning of the immune system.\nWhen the number of infected CD4+ T-cells are sufficiently suppressed, this leads to the symptomatic stage of the infection, making the patient susceptible to a host of opportunistic infections popularly known as AIDS. An untreated person with AIDS can die from a common cold in a matter of days, much less from more virulent infections.\nProof of individuals resistant to HIV emerged in 1994 when Stephen Crohn was found to be free of the virus after multiple sexual encounters with partners infected with HIV. He was found after several years of research seeking to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to viral entry into white blood cells. When investigators analyzed Crohn’s blood, they found a mutation that makes a malfunctioning CCR5 receptor, preventing the HIV virus from entering helper T cells.\nSince the identification of this mechanism, considerable research has gone into developing therapeutic interventions to block the function of CCR5. Though several drugs called CCR5 receptor antagonists have been studied, Maraviroc, developed by Pfizer and approved by the FDA in August of 2007, remains the first and only CCR5 inhibitor on the market. The drug was found to achieve complete suppression of the virus in 60 percent of people who have had significant resistance to other HIV drugs, though potential serious liver toxicity requires close monitoring.\nAdvances in HIV treatments, however, have not made access to the drugs for those infected universal. Only 59 percent of people living with HIV are receiving antiviral treatment, leaving 15.2 million human beings constantly in fear of dying from a minor infection.\nMoreover, stem cell transplants from CCR5 mutation donors are unlikely to be realistic treatment options for millions affected by the virus. Combination treatment regimens are available, and the transplants carry significant harsh side effects, including the risk of death.\nHowever, having elucidated the molecular pathways and applying the proof of concepts in the treatment of these individuals provides a tremendous impetus towards designing new cures and targeting the treatment for eradicating HIV and possibly future diseases. This will require a global collaborative effort, unfettered by the capitalist market and profit considerations, to coordinate and translate these findings into measurable outcomes.\nCirculation in the extremities is also compromised due to effects of high blood pressure on tendons and joints stemming from narrowing of the arteries.\nConditions such as atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases can cause the blood vessels to narrow which increases blood pressure. Because of this, cholesterol may accumulate in the tendons and joints which can cause inflammation. It is of the Achilles tendon is a common condition that is linked to hypertension. It can cause inflammation and pain in the tendon that is in the back of the ankle.\nAnother organ that the effects of high blood pressure can hit is the kidneys. The kidneys are essential because they serve as filters for excess fluid and other waste material inside our body.\nHypertension can cause kidney failure, both by harming the arteries and blood vessels leading to the kidneys, which can cause rupture or damage to the filtering action, or by scarring, and thus damaging, the tiny blood vessels in the kidneys. Symptoms of hypertension are critical to recognize and apply.\nFundamentally, these underlying reactions may spare your life. You should visit your essential doctor promptly when you displaying any of them. Thus, you are encouraged to keep your blood pressure under control and maintain a healthy lifestyle. You should execute a standard routine, for example,\nNursing physical assessment for patient safety in general wards: Reaching consensus on core skills | QUT ePrints\nTo determine consensus across acute care specialty areas on core physical assessment skills necessary for early recognition of changes in patient status in general wards. Background\nCurrent approaches to physical assessment are inconsistent and have not evolved to meet increased patient and system demands. New models of nursing assessment are needed in general wards that ensure a proactive and patient safety approach. Design\nA modified Delphi study. Methods\nFocus group interviews with 150 acute care registered nurses (RNs) at a large tertiary referral hospital generated a framework of core skills that were developed into a web-based survey. We then sought consensus with a panel of 35 senior acute care RNs following a classical Delphi approach over three rounds. Consensus was predefined as at least 80% agreement for each skill across specialty areas.\nContent analysis of focus group transcripts identified 40 discrete core physical assessment skills. In the Delphi rounds, 16 of these were consensus validated as core skills and were conceptually aligned with the primary survey: (Airway) Assess airway patency; (Breathing) Measure respiratory rate, Evaluate work of breathing, Measure oxygen saturation; (Circulation) Palpate pulse rate and rhythm, Measure blood pressure by auscultation, Assess urine output; (Disability) Assess level of consciousness, Evaluate speech, Assess for pain; (Exposure) Measure body temperature, Inspect skin integrity, Inspect and palpate skin for signs of pressure injury, Observe any wounds, dressings, drains and invasive lines, Observe ability to transfer and mobilise, Assess bowel movements.\nAmong a large and diverse group of experienced acute care RNs consensus was achieved on a structured core physical assessment to detect early changes in patient status. Relevance to clinical practice\nAlthough further research is needed to refine the model, clinical application should promote systematic assessment and clinical reasoning at the bedside.\nClinical deterioration, Delphi method, early recognition, general wards, nursing assessment, nurse surveillance, patient assessment, patient observations, patient safety, physical assessment skills\n10.1111/jocn.13201\nAustralian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification > MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES (110000) > NURSING (111000)Australian and New Zealand Standard Research Classification > MEDICAL AND HEALTH SCIENCES (110000) > NURSING (111000) > Clinical Nursing - Secondary (Acute Care) (111003)\nThey address medically relevant topics—be they poignant, believed-provoking, or just plain entertaining.

The CDC recommends folks make positive they are up-to-date with their COVID-19 vaccines just before travel. Some COVID-19 infections can lead to really serious illness, and in some circumstances death. If an individual has a far more significant illness from COVID-19, they might be admitted to the hospital. If eligible, and within 5 days of symptom onset, Paxlovid should be deemed the first treatment option.\nTo minimise the influence of this, we clean the information, editing or removing factors that are clearly incorrect. In these initial information, we identified some distinct good quality concerns with the healthcare and social care worker query responses and have consequently applied some data editing to improve the good quality. Cleaning will continue to take place to further boost the good quality of the information on healthcare and social care workers, which could lead to compact revisions in future releases. Additional, our estimates of “days at risk” in the final 4 weeks in the model increasingly below-estimated time at threat in this period simply because of the increasing numbers on month-to-month visits who had not yet had their subsequent go to. The strategy of estimation hence required changing to account for the pattern of monthly tests. With these clearance time estimates we can then model backwards, deducing when new positives must have occurred in order to generate the positivity estimate.\nTaking into consideration, the simplicity of specimen collection, shortage of PPE and the transmissibility of the virus, saliva could allow self-collection for correct large-scale SARS-CoV-two surveillance testing.

Pillar 3 information is provided for England by NHS England and Improvement . Pillar 1 information for England is offered by the NHS and PHE, and data from the devolved administrations are supplied by the Division of Wellness of Northern Ireland, the Scottish Government, and Public Wellness Wales. Quite a few organisations feed data, from a number of sources, into the everyday statistics on testing. Everyday testing information published by DHSC covers the whole of the UK. These different routes are administered in distinctive methods and that has an influence on how they are reported.\nTo calculate a optimistic rate for Hong Kong, we use the “Latest predicament of reported instances of COVID-19 in Hong Kong” file published by the Division of Wellness. The good rate is computed as the quantity of cases divided by the number of tests, for every reporting period shown in the original testing information. Due to the fact 8 Dec 2020, soon after possessing verified the excellent of the information reported, the national public well being agency announced that all PCR and antigen test final results would now be included in the calculation of national epidemiological indicators. Prior to 7 April 2020, the daily bulletins reported the cumulative quantity of discarded (“descartados”) and confirmed (“casos confirmados”) cases separately without a combined “samples processed” (“muestras procesadas”) figure. For these bulletins, we compute the number of samples tested to date as the sum of the number of discarded and confirmed instances. The Costa Rican Ministry of Overall health maintains an official dashboard reporting COVID-19 statistics.\nFor every single file, we only maintain the row that reports national information, merge the two files together, and add up confirmed and negative circumstances to find the number of people today tested every single day. We then calculate the constructive rate as the 7-day sum of good tests divided by the 7-day sum of men and women tested. The Maltese Ministry of Wellness publishes each day COVID-19 updates on its official Facebook web page reporting the cumulative quantity of tests performed, which has been our source due to the fact 20 January 2021. Previously, we utilized the Ministry of Health’s GitHub till it stopped updating testing information. Situational reports consistently state that testing figures refer to the number of samples tested.

These variants now account for extra than 90 % of COVID situations nationwide, according to the CDC.\nIt is feasible that some participants may possibly take the swab incorrectly, which could lead to far more false-unfavorable benefits. Nevertheless, investigation from April 2020 recommended that self-swabbing beneath supervision is most likely to be as precise as swabs collected directly by healthcare workers. Further, as soon as national testing programmes started in August 2020, most individuals in the UK became familiar with taking nose and throat swabs themselves. Many neighborhood retailers and pharmacies provide more than-the-counter at-household antigen tests obtainable for buy.\nWhen the nasal swab test is performed, the healthcare worker places the COVID swab into the collection tube and sends the test to the lab. Fast, sensitive and particular detection and reporting of infectious pathogens is crucial for patient management and epidemic surveillance. We demonstrated a point-of-care method integrated with a smartphone for detecting live virus from nasal swab media, working with a panel of equine respiratory infectious ailments as a model technique for corresponding human illnesses such as COVID-19. Certain nucleic acid sequences of five pathogens were amplified by loop-mediated isothermal amplification on a microfluidic chip and detected at the end of reactions by the smartphone.\nMen and women with a history of serious adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines and/or components of the vaccines.

Nonetheless, the large number of current higher excellent orthopaedic randomised controlled trials being carried out in the UK is really encouraging, and the orthopaedic community must thus be lauded for its efforts. A different critical cause for the lack of evidence is the failure of investigators to report their unfavorable findings, the refusal of journals to publish such findings, or each. Though no-remedy or placebo controlled trials are feasible for some orthopaedic interventions, they may well not be feasible for all. Some of the guideline bodies highlighted the will need to prioritise study so that some of these procedures, such as arthroscopic meniscal repair of the knee for traumatic tears, would be informed by a fantastic evidence base.\nInitially, orthopedic surgery was referenced only in the abnormal improvement of youngsters and how to best aid them overcome any functional problems they had.

        "description": "Innovation Agency NWC - Patients to get faster access to new treatments and tech\nPatients to get faster access to new treatments and tech\nGround-breaking treatments and technologies tackling key health issues such as cancer, dementia and obesity, are to be fast-tracked to NHS patients quicker than ever in a move welcomed by the Innovation Agency.\nIt follows the expansion of the recently created Accelerated Access Collaborative (AAC) which brings together the Government, NHS and industry leaders, streamlining national structures which support innovation in the NHS.\nThe AAC will accelerate the most promising medicines, diagnostic tools and digital services through the clinical development and regulatory approval process so patients can benefit as soon as possible.\nIt will act as the national front door for innovators looking to get their products funded by the NHS and it will provide a tailored package of support to overcome the barriers in the NHS which can prevent the best medical innovations from reaching patients.\nSpeeding up the time it takes for NHS patients to access the best innovations is a core part of the NHS Long Term Plan, which is backed by an extra £33.9 billion.\nPart of the plan involves extra funding for the Innovation Agency and its 14 fellow Academic Health Science Networks (AHSNs) to deliver Innovation Exchanges, finding the right support for innovative products, promoting regional adoption and spread and increasing health system collaboration.\nInnovation Agency Chief Executive Dr Liz Mear said: \"For the AHSNs acting as the agents for change on the ground, it is really exciting to see this strengthening of NHS structures and leadership to get innovations to patients, faster.\n\"We are already experiencing a bigger push from the centre to accelerate the move of new products from the lab bench to the bedside and I am looking forward to seeing the impact of our bold ambition on the people who matter most, our patients.\"\nThe AAC has launched a number of 'rapid uptake products' to increase their uptake and use within the NHS, which are being supported by the Innovation Agency and all AHSNs. This includes a blood test for pre-eclampsia, which can diagnose the condition earlier in pregnancy and significantly reduce life-threatening complications.\n\"Exposure to Anesthetic May Promote Addiction: Study Shows Anesthesiologists Are Exposed to Fentanyl despite Its Intravenous Administration\" by Splete, Heidi - Clinical Psychiatry News, Vol. 32, Issue 12, December 2004 | Online Research Library: Questia\nHome » Browse » Magazines » Psychology Magazines » Clinical Psychiatry News » Article details, \"Exposure to Anesthetic May Promote Addiction:...\"\nWASHINGTON -- Exposure to fentanyl in the operating room may fuel the consistently high rates of substance abuse among anesthesiologists, Mark S. Gold, M.D., reported at the annual conference of the Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse.\nAlthough substance use problems among physicians receive more attention than they did in the past, few studies have examined possible prognostic factors, said Dr. Gold, chief of addiction medicine at the University of Florida, Gainesville.\nWhen ether, chloroform, and nitrous gas were used, anesthesiologists would keep track of their mental status because they knew there was a danger of secondhand exposure. What they don't know is that the risk remains despite the use of intravenous analgesics, he said at the conference, also sponsored by Brown Medical School.\nWhen a patient is injected with fentanyl in the operating room, Dr. Gold proposed, he or she becomes the vector for distribution of the analgesic into the air by breathing it out through the mouth. This puts anesthesiologists at increased risk for secondhand exposure because they work directly over the patient. Dr. Gold and his colleagues collected samples of the air in a cardiovascular surgery suite where massive amounts of fentanyl were used--more than the body could metabolize--and found that fentanyl was expired by patients and available for secondhand exposure.\n\"We collected air and compared chromatograms, and we could extract fentanyl from the air over the patient's mouth, where the anesthesiologist would be,\" Dr. Gold explained.\nThe clinical implications of these findings may prompt hospital administrators to reassess their operating room setups. \"Just because a drug is injected intravenously does not mean that it won't contaminate the air,\" Dr. Gold said. Fentanyl is released into the air simply by popping open the vial, for example, or there could be leakage from the intravenous line during surgery.\n\"We are convinced, based on these data, that further studies are indicated, and we have ongoing sampling of anesthesiologists during cardiovascular surgery to measure their fentanyl levels through second-hand exposure,\" he said. \"We also are planning a provocative functional brain image study where we show a picture of an operating room and measure brain imaging changes.\"\nThe air collection study focused on fentanyl because it is 100 times more powerful than morphine and is injected in very high doses. The Department of Defense took an interest in the research, and made a financial contribution, because fentanyl was the drug used to put Russian theater-goers to sleep in 2002 after Chechen rebels had stormed the building.\nFentanyl is a common drug of abuse in Florida. \"If you look at the database for the state of Florida, fentanyl is abused in 90% of cases of physician addicts,\" and if fentanyl is being abused by a physician, there's a \"9-out-of-10 chance that it is an anesthesiologist,\" he said. …\nGold, Mark S.--Research\nAnesthesiologists--Research\nAnesthesiologists--Drug Use\nFentanyl--Adverse and Side Effects\nFentanyl--Research\nAlcohol Is Not the Gateway to Hard Drug Abuse By Golub, Andrew Lang Johnson, Bruce D.

This multi drug test kit is designed for qualitative determination of drug substances in human urine specimen.\nThe 6 Panel - (AMP) Amphetamine drug test, (BZD) Benzodiazepine drug test, (COC) Cocaine drug test, (MET) Methamphetamine drug test, (MTD) Methadone drug test, and (MOR) Morphine Drug Testing device is based on the principle of specific immunochemical reaction between antibodies and antigens to analyze particular compounds in human urine specimen. The assay relies on the competition for binding antibody between drug conjugate and free drug which may be present in the urine specimen being tested. When the Amphetamine (AMP), Benzodiazepine (BZD), Cocaine (COC), Methamphetamine (MET), Methadone (MTD), or Morphine (MOR) drug is present in the urine specimen, it competes with drug conjugate for the limited amount of antibody-dye conjugate. When the amount of the Amphetamine (AMP), Benzodiazepine (BZD), Cocaine (COC), Methamphetamine (MET), Methadone (MTD), or Morphine (MOR) drug is equal or more than the cut-off, it will prevent the binding of drug conjugate to the antibody. Therefore, a positive urine specimen on this 6 Panel Drug Test will not show a colored band on the test line zone, indicating a positive result, while the presence of a colored band indicates a negative result. A control line is present in the test window to work as procedural control. This colored band should always appear on the control line zone if the 6 Panel Drug testing device is stored in good condition and the 6 Panel Drug Test- (AMP) Amphetamine drug test, (BZD) Benzodiazepine drug test, (COC) Cocaine drug test, (MET) Methamphetamine drug test, (MTD) Methadone drug test, and (MOR) Morphine drug test is performed appropriately.\nAmphetamines, potent sympathominetic agents, are central nervous stimulants which cause the neutrotrransmitters epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine to be released into the brain and body causing euphoria, alertness, and increased energy, and in more acute cases producing anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations and psychotic behavior. Benzodiazepines are central nervous system depressants that can result in addiction and lead to drowsiness, dizziness, muscle relaxation, lethargy, coma, and possible death. Cocaine, from cocoa plant leaves, is a potent central nervous system stimulant which could induce physiological dependency. Methadone, a synthetic opioid that acts on central nervous system to produce respiratory and circulatory depression, is used for treatment of severe pain and in maintenance for morphine and heroin addictions, and in high doses induces analgesia, sedation, respiratory depression and coma. Methamphetamine, a synthetic amphetamine derivative, is a potent sympathomimetic agent that leads to euphoria, alertness, reduced appetite, and increased energy with acute doses producing anxiety, paranoia, psychosis, and cardiac dysrhythmias. Morphine (MOR) is an opioid analgesic, the principal and most active alkaloid of opium. Acute high doses of opiates-heroin-morphine drugs used by abusers or addicts can cause depressed coordination, disrupted decision, decreased respiration, hypothermia and coma.\nThe six panel drug test kit-(AMP) Amphetamine drug test, (BZD) Benzodiazepine drug test, (COC) Cocaine drug test, (MET) Methamphetamine drug test, (MTD) Methadone drug test, and (MOR) Morphine drug test provides only a preliminary analytical test result. A more specific alternative chemical method must be used in order to obtain a confirmed analytical result. Gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) has been established as the preferred confirmatory method by the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Clinical consideration and professional judgment should be applied to any drug of abuse test result, particularly when preliminary positive results are indicated.\nThe optional built-in Adulteration Test is for validation of urine specimen's integrity and must not be used for In Vitro diagnostic use. For customized cutoff levels for any multi panel drug tests, please contact Customer Service. This 6 panel drug test - (AMP) Amphetamine drug test, (BZD) Benzodiazepine drug test, (COC) Cocaine drug test, (MET) Methamphetamine drug test, (MTD) Methadone drug test, and (MOR) Morphine drug test is available in cassette, strip, or cup format.\nImplementation of Decrees 457 and 482 of 2020 regarding transport | Brigard Urrutia\nBy means of External Circular No. 202010125131 of April 2, 2020, the Ministry of Transport develops Decrees to issue provisions on public transport.\nThe circular makes provision for the following services:\n1. The public service of land transport of cargo.\nThe exceptions referred to in Decree 457 do not specify a type of vehicle, but rather limit the cargo transport service to that which corresponds to the goods strictly necessary to prevent, mitigate and attend to the emergency and which are listed in Article 3 of the same Decree, as well as the cargo transport of imports and exports.\n2. Collective land transport service for passengers (metropolitan, district and municipal), mixed and special.\nDecree No. 457 provides that public land transport services must be guaranteed in the national territory for persons carrying out the activities permitted under article 3.\nDecree 482 of 2020, did not establish limitations on the modalities for the transport of persons exempted under article 3 of Decree 457, therefore, the transport service must continue to be provided in the modalities of passenger groups (metropolitan, district, municipal), mixed and special.\n3. Mass public passenger transport service\nDecree 482 of 2020, establishes that during the state of emergency and mandatory preventive isolation, the authorized offer cannot, in any case, exceed fifty percent (50%) of the maximum offer in each system according to the mobility analysis of each municipal, district or metropolitan authority.\n4. Public service of individual land transport of passengers in taxi type vehicles\nDecree 482 of 2020 establishes that, during the state of emergency and the mandatory preventive isolation, it is allowed to operate the public service of individual passenger transport of the taxi type that is offered by telephone or through technological platforms authorized by the Ministry of Transport to transport people who are exempted under Article 3 of Decree 457 of 2020. The service must be provided in strict compliance with the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection regarding the conditions for preventing contamination and implementing biosecurity measures.\n5. Public service of land transport of passengers\nArticle 4 of Decree 457 of 2020 states that transport must be guaranteed to persons carrying out the activities of Article 3 of the same Decree.\nArticle 4 of Decree 482 of 2020 establishes that during the state of emergency and mandatory preventive isolation, public passenger transport by land is allowed only for access or the provision of health services and to persons who require mobilization and are authorized under the terms of Decree 457 of 2020.\nFor each authorized route, operations are reduced to 50% of the authorized transport capacity, without prejudice to the possibility of modifying this percentage. 50% is understood to be the maximum permitted to offer, so that they may operate at a lower percentage, which does not result in the sanction for cancellation of the route.\nThe land transport terminals must continue to provide their services, considering the authorized operations offer or guaranteeing the attention to the public in a non-face-to-face way either by telephone or e-mail.\n6. Fluvial transport\nArticle 4 of Decree 457 of 2020 establishes that the fluvial transport service in the national territory must be guaranteed as strictly necessary to prevent, mitigate and attend to the health emergency caused by the Coronavirus COVID-19 and for the transport of people and goods exempted in Article 3 of the same Decree.\nCOVID-19 patient information and its impact on businesses - AZ Big Media\nBusiness News / COVID-19 patient information and its impact on businesses\nCOVID-19 patient information and its impact on businesses\nBusiness News | 7 Apr, 2020 | Meghan OConnor and Simone Colgan Dunlap\nIn response to the declaration of a nationwide emergency concerning COVID-19, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a waiver (effective March 15) of limited HIPAA Privacy Rule obligations for covered entities located in Secretary Azar's January 31 public health emergency declaration area during the first 72 hours after the activation of the entity's emergency response plan. Under the waiver, HHS will waive sanctions and penalties against a covered hospital that does not comply with the following provisions of the Privacy Rule:\nUnder HIPAA, covered entity health care providers may disclose PHI about individuals who have been exposed to, or are suspected of having contracted, COVID-19 to public health authorities authorized by law to receive such information for preventing or controlling the spread of disease. However, providers should consult applicable authority under state law before relying solely on HIPAA as authorizing a permissive disclosure. Some states have mandatory public health reporting obligations. Further, reporting obligations and options may vary depending on whether the subject individual is a patient, workforce member who is not a patient, or workforce member who is also a patient.\nCOVID-19 and the risks of an expanded remote workforce\nHow COVID-19 increases cyber risk and tips to protect yourself\nOn March 24, OCR issued guidance outlining how providers may disclose health information about an individual infected with or exposed to COVID-19 to law enforcement, paramedics, and other first responders (in addition to public health authorities) without patient authorization. The guidance outlines disclosures for treatment purposes, when first responders may be at risk of infection, and provides additional specific examples related to EMS and 911 call centers. The guidance also reminds providers of the general obligation (with limited exceptions) to limit disclosures to minimally necessary information.\nProviders should familiarize themselves with permissive and mandatory reporting obligations and state-specific obligations regarding handling, use, and disclosure of patient information.\nIn addition to HIPAA, health and life sciences entities are familiar with additional legal obligations related to particularly sensitive health information, including alcohol and drug abuse treatment records, HIV, mental health, etc. These increased protections remain in place without express waivers or exceptions for emergencies.\nHIPAA's obligations to implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information are not waived in a public health emergency. Providers adapting to changing conditions, makeshift testing facilities, and increased patient volumes must continue to implement appropriate safeguards.\nWith increasing interest in symptoms, testing, care, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients, access controls are an important safeguard for snooping (even from well-meaning workforce members). HIPAA covered entities must implement reasonable and appropriate safeguards, to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information. Providers should implement heightened access controls (e.g., break the glass or VIP designations), provide reminders to workforce members on appropriate and inappropriate access, and review and respond audit logs.\nMeghan O'Connor and Simone Colgan Dunlap are attorneys with Quarles & Brady.

Global Research Report\nAuthors: Jonathan Adams, David Pendlebury and Martin Szomszo. Institute for Scientific Information https://tinyurl.com/utstunl.\nIn 2019, around 145,000 researchers from, on average, 139 countries working across a diversity of research disciplines interrogated the Web of Science each day to explore research information and discover key literature to inform current research.\nIn 1981 the Web of Science indexed approximately 500,000 papers (substantive academic articles and reviews) from 6,800 journals; this expanded substantially to 2.5 million papers sourced from 21,300 journals in 2019. This is a deep data resource for a wide range of analytic uses.\nThere are, however, few studies of how the Web of Science is used as a bibliographic database other than for the purposes of search and discovery. Our analysis shows that Web of Science is the primary source of publication and citation data for the majority of systematic research reviews across a broad range of disciplines and about twice as many research management and evaluation studies as any other source. Web of Science is the primary data source for such work in the USA, China, and most of western Europe. Countries where the Scopus database was more frequently acknowledged include Iran and Italy.\nA key beneficiary of structured use of Web of Science bibliographic records are the biomedical researchers who have an established and structured approach to accessing raw material for reviews that inform the development and current state of research topics that are critical to human health and disease control. (F: Executive summary of the report, february 2020).\nDVd-T Results in High Anti-Cancer Response Rates in Multiple Myeloma\nAccording to results presented at the 2003 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), the treatment combination consisting of Doxil®, Oncovin® (vincristine), dexamethasone and Thalomid® (thalidomide) produces high anti-cancer response rates in patients with multiple myeloma. However, long-term follow-up and direct comparative clinical trials to different treatment approaches are necessary to determine the true clinical relevance of DVd-T in the treatment of multiple myeloma.\nMultiple myeloma is a cancer involving important immune (infection-fighting) cells called plasma cells. Plasma cells aid the body in fighting infection by producing specialized proteins called antibodies that have the ability to target and/or kill foreign cells. In multiple myeloma, cancerous plasma cells produce abnormal and excessive antibodies that do not have the ability to properly fight infection. In addition, the cancerous plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow, suppressing the normal formation and function of other cells that are necessary for normal production of blood cells and immune functions. The excessive accumulation of cancer cells in the bone marrow ultimately leads to the formation of tumors in the bone and to the breakdown of bone. Standard treatment for multiple myeloma is chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation.\nResearchers from the Cleveland Clinic Myeloma Program recently conducted a clinical trial to evaluate a treatment combination including the chemotherapy agents Doxil® and Oncovin®, the steroid dexamethasone, and the anti-angiogenesis agent Thalomid® (DVd-T) in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma. This trial consisted of 50 patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma who had received no previous therapy, and 50 patients with recurrent multiple myeloma. A complete disappearance of detectable cancer (complete remission) was achieved in 46% of newly diagnosed patients, and 47% of patients with recurrent multiple myeloma. Stabilization of disease or partial anti-cancer responses were achieved in over 80% of patients. The major side effect of this treatment was blood clots.\nThese researchers concluded that the treatment combination DVd-T appears to be very active in the treatment of both newly diagnosed and recurrent multiple myeloma. Long-term follow-up and direct comparisons to stem cell transplants and newer agents such as Velcade® will truly determine the clinical benefit of this treatment regimen. Patients with multiple myeloma, particularly those who are not eligible for a stem cell transplant, may wish to speak with their physician about the risks and benefits of DVd-T or the participation in a clinical trial evaluating other therapeutic options.\nReference: Agrawal NR, Hussein MA, Elson P, et al.

Science News\nU of Minn researchers find primary alcohol prevention programs are needed for 'tweens'\nStudy recommends that prevention programs occur as early as third grade\nA study by the University of Minnesota School of Public Health and the University of Florida suggests that 'tweens' should receive alcohol prevention programs prior to sixth grade, when nearly one in six children are already alcohol users.\nThe study found that adolescents who already use alcohol are less receptive to prevention programs aimed at all students. Intervening at earlier ages, specifically between third and fifth grade, would allow for truly universal anti-alcohol messages that would also provide support for high-risk students.\n\"Children who use alcohol in sixth grade respond differently to messages about alcohol use than those have not used alcohol,\" said Keryn Pasch, M.P.H., Ph.D., University of Minnesota School of Public Health and first author of the study. \"By sixth grade it's too late; we'll miss many of the at-risk kids.\"\nThe study, published in the journal Health Education and Behavior, compared sixth-graders who had used alcohol in the past year to those who had not, in a multi-ethnic, urban sample of more than 4,000 students in 61 Chicago schools. Among this sample, 17 percent had used alcohol within the past year.\nThe study found that sixth-grade users of alcohol were significantly different from the non-users on almost all risk factors examined. For example, users were more likely to be male, engage in violent or delinquent behavior, and have friends who used alcohol.\nFactors such as lacking the confidence to refuse alcohol and failing to perceive and value the negative consequences of alcohol use are critical in at-risk children. \"These are important to note because they are amenable to intervention,\" Pasch said.\nResearchers suggest a prevention program prior to sixth grade in which parent involvement is central. Students should receive developmentally-appropriate messages that correct inaccurate perceptions that 'drinking is normal' and that provide tweens with the skills to refuse alcohol. In addition, interventions should include parental involvement in order to help create opportunities for increased parent-child communication and provide parents with the skills to increase monitoring.\n\"Parents and the general public don't realize how early alcohol use starts,\" Pasch said. \"However, in early intervention, parental involvement is a key factor in delaying alcohol use.\""

The five-year collaboration brings together Yingli’s experience in medicinal chemistry with MD Anderson’s comprehensive clinical and translational resources to drive existing Yingli therapeutic candidates into four U.S.-based clinical trials and to facilitate preclinical discovery and development in additional indications.\n“This tremendous opportunity will accelerate our efforts as we look to bring new pharmacological agents to cancer patients in need,\" said Michael Hui, MBA, chief executive officer of Yingli. “We look forward to working with the experts at MD Anderson,\ncomplementing our own expertise as we continue to build a well-rounded oncology pipeline.”\nTwo of the programs supported by the collaboration will leverage favorable clinical trial findings collected from China-based studies. The first program will focus on linperlisib, a PI3Kδ inhibitor with a novel structure, which has had positive results in eight active or completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for patients with lymphomas and solid tumors, including peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL).\n“We are pleased to be working with Yingli to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating linperlisib in patients with PTCL,” said principal investigator Swaminathan Iyer, M.D., professor of Lymphoma & Myeloma at MD Anderson. “This collaboration brings a potentially effective treatment option with a favorable safety profile to the U.S. to address an unmet need for patients with this aggressive cancer. I look forward to leading this exciting study.”\nThe second program will develop YL-13027, a novel, oral TGFβR1 inhibitor for use in advanced solid tumors with plans to initiate a U.S.-based Phase 1 clinical trial in 2022, led by Jordi Rodon, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at MD Anderson.\n“The TGFβ pathway is an important immune regulator in the tumor microenvironment, and new treatments focused on enhancing anti-tumor immunity are desperately needed,” Rodon said. “We look forward to working with Yingli to conduct the first U.S.-based clinical trial evaluating their TGFβR1 inhibitor.”\nIn addition to advancing existing clinical programs, the collaboration also will focus on translational studies to further Yingli’s discovery programs. The collaborative approach will provide a steady stream of new therapeutic candidates for oncology clinical development, which the MD Anderson team, including David S. Hong, M.D., deputy chair of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics, will investigate.\nAbout Linperlisib Linperlisib (YY-20394) is a highly selective and potent PI3Kδ inhibitor that has shown a favorable safety profile, encouraging anti-tumor activities and promising PK and pharmaceutical properties as an oral once-a-day agent in late-stage clinical development. A Phase 1 clinical trial was completed in 2020 demonstrating linperlisib to be a safe and tolerable agent, and a recommended Phase 2 dose of 80 mg QD was established. Linperlisib was awarded NMPA Breakthrough Therapy status in China, leading to a Phase 2 study in follicular lymphoma (FL) that was completed and submitted in 2021 to China marketing authority for approval. In addition, linperlisib received FDA Orphan Drug Designations for FL, CLL/SLL and T cell lymphoma. Multiple linperlisib clinical trials being conducted in FL, PTCL, other lymphomas, solid tumors, combination with gemcitabine/oxaliplatin in r/r DLBC and combination with therapeutic PD1 antibody are underway in China and the U.S. Preliminary results of single agent linperlisib from a relapsed or recurrent PTCL Phase1b study were reported at ASCO 2021, indicating an overall response rate of 70% with 33% CRs for this difficult to treat and aggressive form of lymphoma.\nAbout YL-13027 YL-13027 is a potent small molecule antagonist of TGFβR1 kinase in early-stage clinical development. The compound was optimized with selectivity against TGFβR2 and other kinases, differentiating YL-13027 from other inhibitors blocking TGFβ signaling. In preclinical studies, YL-13027 demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy, tumor immune modulation and combination benefit with immunotherapy. In IND-enabling studies, YL-13027 showed reliable dose-proportionality and pharmacokinetic properties, and the agent proved to be safe and tolerable in toxicity studies. The preliminary results of a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial of single agent YL-13027 were reported at ASCO 2021, including the safety and efficacy findings that the open-label study is continuing in order to establish a recommended Phase 2 dose of YL-13027.\nAbout Yingli Yingli Pharma US, Inc. is headquartered in San Francisco, CA. Yingli is an innovative clinical stage biotechnology company that is developing best-in-class and first-in-class oral investigational agents for the treatment of cancer, metabolic and autoimmune diseases. In addition to linperlisib and YL-13027, Yingli has two other investigational agents in clinical development, including YL-15293, a novel selective inhibitor of KRAS G12C and YL-90148, an investigational oral URAT-1 inhibitor for the treatment of in hyperuricemia/gout. Several additional oncology programs are in IND-enabling or candidate development stages.\nFor more information about Yingli and the investigational agent portfolio, visit http://www.yl-pharma.com\nAbout MD Anderson The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston ranks as one of the world's most respected centers focused on cancer patient care, research, education and prevention.

The relationship between systolic blood pressure and cardiovascular risk--results of the Brisighella Heart Study. J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich). 2003;5(1):47-52.\nWe examined the relationship of systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and pulse pressure to coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease risk in a prospective population-based European cohort. The Brisighella Heart Study included 2939 men and women between the ages of 14-84 without prior coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease and not taking antihypertensive therapy at baseline. Cox regression was used to obtain hazard ratios (HRs) for coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease as a function of baseline blood pressure parameters over a 23-year follow-up. Higher combined coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease risk was evident in comparison to the referent of <120 mm Hg, with a 44% increased risk at SBP 120-139 mm Hg (HR, 1.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-2.09; p=0.052), 76% increased risk at SBP 140-159 mm Hg (HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.16-2.69; p=0.009), and 109% increased risk at SBP >or=160 mm Hg (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.31-3.35; p=0.0021). Trends of increasing risk with increasing levels of blood pressure were significant for SBP and pulse pressure, (p<0.0001) but not for DBP (p=0.058). In this European cohort, SBP was a stronger predictor of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease events than DBP, and an increase in risk was already evident with high-normal SBP (120-139 mm Hg). The prognostic significance of pulse pressure was also demonstrated. The importance of SBP as seen in the Framingham Heart Study may be generalized to a European population with differences in diet and other risk factors.\nThe Black Swan Dental Spa takes a different approach to dentistry, offering traditional and cosmetic procedures in their comfortable spa.

The cells on the left have been reprogrammed to make them less vulnerable to the degenerative effects of retinitis pigmentosa. As a result, more have survived compared to the untreated cells in the right image.\nCorbo, MD, PhD\n\"We think it may be significantly easier to preserve vision by modifying existing cells in the eye than it would be to introduce new stem cells,\" says senior author Joseph Corbo, MD, PhD, assistant professor of pathology and immunology. \"A diseased retina is not a hospitable environment for transplanting stem cells.\"\n'\"The question was, when retinitis pigmentosa is caused by a mutation in a protein only active in rods, can we reduce or stop vision loss by making the cells less rod-like?\" he explains.\n\"In adult mice, switching off Nrl partially converts the rod cells into cone cells,\" he says. \"Several months later, when the mutant mice normally had very little vision left, we tested the function of their retina.\"\nWashington University School of Medicine's 2,100 employed and volunteer faculty physicians also are the medical staff of Barnes-Jewish and St. Louis Children's hospitals.

If you have suffered the amputation of a limb as a result of a car accident, you are no doubt struggling to adjust to post-amputation life. One thing you could be dealing with in this regard is what doctors refer to as \"phantom limb\" pain.\nPhantom limb pain is exactly what it sounds like. Your leg or arm hurts and aches constantly, even though it's not even there. This condition can be very difficult to deal with psychologically and the pain is real. Here's how you might be able to treat the condition:\nMirror box therapy: Mirror box therapy can be enormously beneficial in many cases. Patients observe themselves receiving physical therapy via a mirror. This helps the brain remap the fact that it doesn't have the limb anymore and it can resolve phantom pain problems.\nLocal injection: Doctors may inject a pain reliever into the site of the amputation. The pain reliever can serve to interrupt pain signals that are being sent by the nerve endings in this region.\nNon-opiate analgesic therapies: Prescription pain medications might also help to interrupt the pain signals that the nerve endings are sending.\nDeep brain stimulation therapy: In this therapy, patients get electrodes placed directly on their brain's surface. By sending electrical impulses it can interrupt the nerve to brain pain signals.\nNerve cuff stimulation: With nerve cuff stimulation, an electrical nerve stimulator makes contact with the nerves going through the amputation site. Instead of blocking nerve signals, it seeks to send pleasant nerve signals to the brain. This serves to replace the negative sensation with a positive one.\nThe above therapies for phantom limb pain are costly. Fortunately, amputation victims hurt by a negligent or unlawful party may be able to pursue compensation in court to get money to pay for these and other vital therapies they require.\nBiomedical Science MSc at Glasgow Caledonian University\nThis programme enables biomedical scientists currently employed in NHS pathology service labs to attain greater expertise and advance to the next stage of their careers.

I'm Paul Evans, and this edition of Airing Pain has been funded by Kyowa Kirin. In a recent edition of Airing Pain – that is number 123, which is still available to download, we looked at issues around the use and overuse of opioid-based medications for the management of chronic pain. One of the contributors in that programme was Dr Cathy Stannard, an internationally recognised expert on aspects of pain management, and particularly opioid therapy. I'll just remind you something she said in that programme.\nCathy Stannard: Do you think the medicines are making much difference? And there is a dawning realisation that it's just like taking Smarties. [That's] something that we commonly hear. We know that patients are fearful of reducing because of course, if your pain is bad, and you're on medicines, what if it's worse [off medicines]? It's very difficult, and it depends on the individual's perceptions and so on. But we do have evidence from a huge number of patient reports that, freed from the many burdensome side effects, people feel much more alert, able to engage with their families and engage themselves in strategies which help manage their pain. So we know that most of the medicines that we prescribe for pain which actually stop the way that nerves talk to other nerves do have side effects which make people sleepy, sedated, giddy and so on. And all those things make it very difficult to start trying to manage people's lives to try and mitigate the effects of long term pain.\nEvans: That was Dr Cathy Stannard, reminding us from an earlier edition of Airing Pain of some of the issues and side effects experienced by those prescribed opioid-based medications for the management of their chronic pain. Well, in this edition of Airing Pain, I want to look at another side effect that's – judging by the volume of calls Pain Concern's helpline received – is of particular concern to those using opioid-based medications for the management of their chronic pain, and that is constipation.\nMaria Eugenicos: 27% of the constipated patients may relate their constipation to medications. In my last clinical audit, I found that approximately 30% of the patients who present with constipation would be on opioid treatments for [a] chronic pain condition.\nEvans: This is Dr Maria Eugenicos. And as we recorded this interview during the Covid-19 crisis – socially distanced, of course, via a video conference line – there are references to the crisis in 2020. So Dr Eugenicos asked is a clinician gastroenterologist and senior lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and Edinburgh's Western General Hospital. She specialises in functional gut disorders.\nEugenicos: Constipation is defined by several criteria that may include difficult, painful defecation, incomplete bowel-emptying, decreased frequency of emptying [and] manual manoeuvres. And by definition for functional constipation, this should be the diagnosis if there is insufficient criteria to make a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome, as in functional constipation. And usually, when we do diagnose constipation, people do not present with loose stools, but with hard, lumpy stools, and may present with loose stools only in the presence of laxatives, if they have been using laxatives probably [due to] their symptoms.\nEvans: One question we have to ask is, what does regular mean? What [are] regular bowel movements?\nEugenicos: If I were to reverse the question, I suppose, I would say, 'Is it abnormal to have less than one bowel movement per day?' And that perhaps is not necessarily the case, in that when [we] have done a study questioning healthy controls, then their frequency of bowel movements varied from three times per week to six times per week. So just frequency does not define constipation. But if the decreased frequency is associated with several other criteria already mentioned, like straining, difficult emptying, painful emptying, then perhaps this allows you to make the diagnosis of constipation. If you compare that with patients with constipation, the majority of patients with constipation would admit to frequency [of] less than once per week. That's the majority of patients – about 60% of these patients. About 20% of patients would say once a week, [and] maybe 5% would say twice a week.\nSo yes, the majority of patients with constipation would have decreased bowel [movement] frequency. The patients with constipation are a great healthcare burden, in that, in previous studies, 80% of the patients attended community nurses requesting treatment for their constipation. So if we track admissions to hospital, where perhaps the primary endpoint, if you like, would be constipation, then it amounts to 70,000,000 in recent studies. The consultant or GP consultations with regard to treatment for constipation management may amount up to 30,000,000 per year, so it's not a dismissive cost. And furthermore, patients who may suffer from constipation may call more often absent from their work – absenteeism is quite high.\nEvans: So how much of a problem is opioid related constipation?\nEugenicos: Now, the opioid related constipation, it is sometimes hard to define, because in a recent study that we performed, we found that patients may be started on opioids without prior inquiring about their symptoms. What we know [is] that 27% of the constipated patients may relate their constipation to medications. Now, opioids are not the only medication that may cause constipation, but it's the most common medication that [is] prescribed and does cause [constipation]. So it's not a negligible amount either. Only 46% of patients with constipation may present with a primary, the rest of them are on secondary. So when we have tried to identify how many of the patients develop constipation, once they have started opioids, it was difficult to define because we did not have that information. For those patients that we had the information – it was about 34% [who] may not have had any symptoms whatsoever, and may develop constipation, following opioids.\nFrom anecdotal evidence, though, we know that if we do not treat the constipation, if we do not address that, and people continue to be opioids, then they may develop opioid induced constipation further down the line. And this is what sometimes may perhaps affect the patient's judgement to say, 'But I have been on opioids and they didn't [cause] the symptoms in the beginning, [but] now I've developed the symptoms.' It could be cumulative effect, because the patient may start on a low dose of the opioids, and then they may increase the dose and then may develop further symptoms.\nEvans: How do you address that with a patient coming to you saying, 'I have constipation, and I'm on opioids', and they've already made that link between them – whether it's a correct link or not? How do you address it?\nEugenicos: That may vary depending on the cause of why the patient was started on the opioids in the first place. Education of patients is very important in these cases. So we try to explain to the patient that the opioids in the treatment of pain perhaps are most successful for the acute pain situation. Yes, we do offer opioid treatment for patients who have got cancer pain, but for chronic conditions, perhaps it's better to try other neuromodulators rather than go directly to the opioid, for the particular reason that constipation itself may cause pain. So we may be aggravating the 'syndrome' – if you like, in inverted commas – of pain, because we're trying to address one type of pain by replacing [it] with something else. I would go through their lifestyle [and] try to address lifestyle measures, and we address their diet [and] their liquid intake. I advocate water – hot water regimes, [as well as] regulating the bowel habits. Trying to make the bowel habits predictable is very important. Exercising, physical activity, the position on the toilet to facilitate relaxation of the pelvic floor, avoiding straining – all of these play a role [in managing constipation] and we try to identify those.\nOnce a patient though, has been referred to my clinic, which is [specifically] a tertiary referral clinic, almost always they would have been tried on other medications. So, we do not only address the lifestyle measures, we would address what medications they have, what doses have they had [of] these medicines. And we are addressing this with the simple laxatives – osmotic laxatives, which is the first choice of treatment, or other similar laxatives if they have had something like that. And if they have not been responding to these, then we would go on to prescribing specialist medications to contract the opioid effect on the bowel motility. [There is] a new opiate receptor antagonist that we have got available, which can be prescribed orally, and the patient can take it at home.\nEvans: Now, I guess you're seeing people who are coming to you because they are unwell. Constipation is a problem to them. What would you suggest people do if they know they're going to be prescribed opioids, to prevent this from the very start.\nEugenicos: We try and educate the patients, in that patients who are on chronic opioid treatment may develop hypersensitivity, visceral hypersensitivity, which is the case in patients who have got IBS, and in particular, in this group of patients, IBS constipation. So if I treat their pain with something that, in the long run, may make their body debilitated to address pain, then perhaps I'm not addressing the question correctly. So what I try and do usually – I would appreciate [that] the patient is in pain, [and] the patient may need to be treated. So I would usually advocate neuromodulators, and the neuromodulators of choice – and these are the medicines that they would be prescribed usually, as a first choice in the pain clinics, especially pain clinics – is tricyclic antidepressants in small doses, either amitriptyline if it's tolerated or nortriptyline. Nortriptyline has got less sedative effect. And [we] only take the opioid over and above for an acute situation [that it] would work better [in]. Sometimes the patients are prescribed mild opioids when patients present with abdominal pain and they are really trying to control their symptoms and that may lead to constipation. And then we're dealing with a mixed type of disorder, which sometimes is harder to treat.\nEvans: You mentioned IBS, irritable bowel syndrome. Explain what that is.\nEugenicos: The irritable bowel syndrome is a syndrome characterised by abdominal pain, which is associated with altered bowel habits. So it may relate either to diarrhoea [and] the presence of abdominal pain, or constipation [and] the presence of abdominal pain. We would make the diagnosis if the symptoms have been present for at least three months prior to the presentation. So it has to be a continuous type of effect. Anybody may develop abdominal pain. When [someone has] altered bowel habits, it doesn't mean that [they] have IBS. But if this is persistent presentation over a period of time, then it would make the diagnosis of IBS. People who may have had chronic constipation for years may develop IBS, when especially each time they have got altered bowel habits, this relates to abdominal pain. And we do warn them that sometimes it can fluctuate. The recent Rome IV criteria have defined that discomfort is not part of the IBS as a syndrome. It has to be pain. And the reason for that is that anybody with constipation may have discomfort, when they become bloated, when the bowel distends with faecal loading, etc. But [when] the pain is present, it's characteristic of the IBS, irritable bowel syndrome.\nEvans: You said constipation or diarrhoea. I've talked to some people who have both.\nEugenicos: When you make a diagnosis of IBS constipation, the patient presents with hard, lumpy stool. And we define that through our consistency, the bowel movement consistency, because this may reflect more accurately the pathophysiology of the syndrome. But these people may have loose stools, but it should be less than 25% of the time. Now, the patients who present with IBS diarrhoea would have abdominal pain and would have looser, watery stools, they could have harder stools, but it should be less than – again – 25% of the time. Now [though], if people present with alternate bowel habits – [as in] constipation alternates with diarrhoea – and this may happen more than 25% of the time, then we are dealing with mixed type IBS. And we have got… there are subtypes that, at times, present with constipation, at times they present with diarrhoea, and they can fluctuate. So it's four types. And again, the reason for the differentiation of these four types is because the bowel [movement] consistency would be different. And that reflects different pathophysiology. And as a result, it would mean different types of treatment for these people.\nEvans: And the reason why I'm asking about IBS is because IBS, irritable bowel syndrome, does seem to go hand in hand with some chronic pain conditions, like fibromyalgia [and] like other conditions, and in some cases, pharmaceutical treatments are the same. They seem to be working on the same systems, am I right?\nEugenicos: Yes, the pain control for fibromyalgia, for example, or for IBS is neuromodulation. For all the chronic pain syndromes like this, [the treatment] would be neuromodulation. We have come across, more often, patients who may have IBS, and may present with fibromyalgia, or other chronic conditions. We do not really know whether this is because it's a very common condition, or whether there is a causative effect, or whether pharmaceutical treatment to address one condition may lead to another. It is a very complex and interrelated situation. But in my clinic, I get quite a few patients with IBS who have resistant symptoms, quite a few of them would have fibromyalgia, quite a few of them may have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and other conditions.\nEvans: Now one of the reasons we're doing this edition of Airing Pain is because of the number of people who phoned up our helpline about it. But also, because of the controversies over using opioids for the management of chronic pain. Do you get people who come to see you with chronic pain conditions, who are heavily reliant on opioids and have constipation?\nEugenicos: Yes, in my last clinical audit, I found that approximately 30% of the patients who present with constipation would be on opioid treatment for a chronic pain condition. So it's quite a high proportion of the constipation patients. Whether these people are referred to my clinic because their primary care professionals or physicians would like us to [advise] these people on specialist treatment or whether [it's] because they are not familiar with a specialist treatment, and the first and second lines of laxative treatment have failed, it is difficult to know.\nBut yes, I do have a cohort of patients [who] present to my clinic with this problem. A young man – he's forty-two years old and was referred to my clinic because his symptoms of constipation and pain were not responding [to treatment]. He had a diagnosis of IBS, [which was] constipation-made, and one of my colleagues, a gastroenterologist asked me to see him. I saw him last July, he was a very switched-on patient. So I took him through the pathophysiology of the IBS syndrome [and] of the constipation and explained to him the long term effect of somebody being on the opioids to control the pain, and offered him the modern way of addressing chronic pain through neuromodulators. And when I explained to him that although I'm trying to treat [his pain] – although it was not me who initiated the opioids – but I said to him, 'I'm your physician, I'm trying to treat your pain, and I'm giving you opioids because they do control the pain. But I have to tell you that in the long run, our studies show that you may develop a hypersensitivity, so I'm giving you opioids to treat the pain, [and they] may make you more hypersensitive to pain and they may not be addressing the pain control at all. He was so motivated, that he went home, studied the information leaflets I gave him on how to gradually reduce and come off the opioids, [and] he managed within three months' time to stop the opioids. And [he] had a review [with] my colleague who saw him in the first instance, in November – which makes it four months down the line – and declared that, 'I followed Dr Eugenicos' advice, I'm off the opioids now, my bowels are back to normal. I do not have much pain, very little pain at all. So I'm feeling much happier.' So you might say, 'Oh, maybe this anecdotal, maybe it is different.' But there is a follow-on story, in that we ran into the [Covid-19] situation. And the patient became quite stressed and quite anxious about his job about this and that, like most people nowadays with the lockdown. And I reviewed him in my specialist clinic only a month ago. And the symptoms, were back to square one. So I was so disappointed. So I said to him, 'What happened?' And he said to me, 'I don't know what happened.' And when I took the history of medications and stuff, he was back on opioids. But I said to him, 'Do you remember when you stopped the opioids, you went and saw so-and-so who wrote to me to say, \"Thank you so much, because you managed to advise my patient, and he's now free of symptoms.\"?'\nHe couldn't remember it, of course, because he went into the situation, had developed pain – perhaps because of stress, because of anxiety – started the opioids because they were handed to him. So when I reminded him and I read the detail of the letter my colleague sent me he said, 'Yes you're right, I was so much better off.' I did say to him, 'I do understand why you went back on them, maybe you are stressed.' But I said to him, 'If you cannot manage without the opioids, I would suggest we do start the neuromodulators.' In the past, he managed to cut down the opioids, to stop the opioids, [and] he didn't even go back to the neuromodulators. But I suppose, because of the current situation, the worries that he had, in particular, he agreed to go on the neuromodulators, and [he agreed] to a regime to try and cut back [the opioids]. And the habits of a few patients like that, that did say, 'I stopped it, because I decided I didn't want to be on this anymore.' And suddenly their symptoms improve. Whether they need to be supported with some form of treatment, either regulating their bowel habits better, or giving them a form of neuromodulator to avoid any of the symptoms coming back. And reinforcing this sort of dependence, if you like, is important as well.\nEvans: You mentioned giving out leaflets – education is absolutely crucial.\nEugenicos: I have got special interest in that. We have developed, with medical students, educational leaflets to give to the patient. We did a trial where we have designed the symptoms, lifestyle measures, medications to take, which are safer for long term, which are perhaps less often prescribed long term etc. And when we gave the patient the questionnaire, what we wanted to know more about, was the pathophysiology behind their symptoms. So what they enjoyed coming and listening about when they were coming to the clinic, is myself, showing them a picture of the [CT scan] and explaining [to] them the journey of the food through their stomach, through their small bowel [and] the large bowel, the function of each one of these organs, the function of the rest of the endocrine, if you like, the enzymes that we produce, how our bowel reacts to that [and] why we develop the symptoms we develop.\nThey were really fascinated, and I think if we allow the patient to be well educated, to know why they get the symptoms they get, what makes their symptoms appear certain times [in the] month, if you like, hormonal changes maybe, stress situations, and they know to address those and prevent their symptoms happening. And if they are in control, this perhaps is the key to successful treatment in general. We manage to know more about how a patient can control their symptoms better through the biofeedback when we were giving the patient the treatment modalities to take home and do it on their own. And because they had to educate themselves, how to work a biofeedback machine: 'What does it do? What does relaxation mean?' They were much better [at] controlling their symptoms and much more successful. So I do [routinely] give them leaflets, but nowadays I give them leaflets relating to their own symptoms. What my task in the future [is], is to make a booklet which would contain all the information [they need], so they don't need to depend either [on] the GPs they're visiting and [being told] this and that, or [depend on] following any healthcare professional. They need to have ownership of their symptoms, of their treatment [and] know what to do in the future.\nEvans: Dr Maria Eugenicos, clinical gastroenterologist at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital. Now, as always, I remind you that we, in Pain Concern, believe the information and opinions on Airing Pain are accurate and sound, based on the best judgments available. You should always consult your health professional on any matter relating to your health and well-being. He or she is the only person who knows you and your circumstances and, therefore, the appropriate action to take on your behalf. You can find all the resources to support the management of chronic pain, including details of our videos, leaflets, all editions of Airing Pain, of course, and Pain Matters magazine at painconcern.org.uk. And Pain Concern is currently preparing an information leaflet and an article for Pain Matters magazine on how to manage opioid induced constipation. So please look out for that in the future. Dr Maria Eugenicos also recommends the IBS network websites as an excellent online resource for the management and understanding of IBS and other related conditions. The address is theibsnetwork.org. There are no gaps.\nEugenicos: In that website, they would be able to ask any questions. These bodies are linked to specialists and if anybody asked questions, they usually would address them to us, and we would answer back. So it's a big cohort of patients who usually try to collaborate. It's more about IBS, but all of these conditions are addressed under this umbrella, it doesn't have to be only IBS. So people, for example, who may have bile acid diarrhoea [and] may ask questions – nobody would tell them, 'By the way, this is not IBS', or if somebody says. 'I have been commenced on the hydrocodone that develop these symptoms, what can I do? Can we address all of these symptoms?'\nTriphase Accelerator to Present Investigational New Drug Enabling Data for TRPH-222\nPublished 5:36 PM ET Mon, 4 Dec 2017 Globe Newswire\nTORONTO and SOMERSET, N.J., Dec. 04, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Triphase Accelerator Corporation, a company dedicated to acquiring and developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, and Catalent, the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs, biologics and consumer health products, today announced Triphase's upcoming ASH presentation as well as Catalent's key publication relating to the preclinical development of TRPH-222, an anti-CD22 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) for the treatment of patients with lymphoma.\nTriphase announced that its preclinical abstract describing TRPH-222, has been accepted by the American Society of Hematology as a poster presentation at the 59th ASH Annual Meeting & Exposition, taking place from December 9-12, 2017 at the Georgia World Congress Center, Atlanta, Georgia. The poster, by MacLaren, et. al., titled \"TRPH-222, a Novel Anti-CD22 Antibody Drug Conjugate, Has Significant Anti-Tumor Activity in NHL Xenografts and Is Well Tolerated in Non-Human Primates,\" will be presented in session 625 on Monday, December 11, 2017 from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m., in building A, level 1, hall A2.\nAlso today, Catalent Biologics announced the publication of a manuscript by Drake, et. al., titled, \"CAT-02-106, a site-specifically conjugated anti-CD22 antibody bearing an MDR1-resistant maytansine payload yields excellent efficacy and safety in preclinical models,\" in Molecular Cancer Therapeutics, a high impact, peer-reviewed medical journal describing preclinical data from novel therapeutic agents. CAT-02-106 was Catalent's research designation for the TRPH-222 program prior to Triphase acquiring the worldwide rights to further develop the program from Catalent Biologics in 2016. CAT-02-106 was developed by Catalent's wholly owned subsidiary, Redwood Bioscience, using its proprietary SMARTag® platform.\n\"We continue to be encouraged by the pre-clinical data from the TRPH-222 program, indicating better tolerability and an expanded therapeutic index for this SMARTag ADC as compared to conventional ADCs,\" commented Dr. Henry Lowman, Executive Director of Research and Development at Triphase. \"We believe this molecule can play an important role in the treatment of lymphoma and we are committed to accelerating its development into the clinic.\"\n\"We are excited about the rapid progress Triphase has achieved with this important compound, and pleased to be partnering with such a capable organization to advance this treatment to patients,\" added Mike Riley, Vice President & General Manager of Catalent Biologics.\nAbout TRPH-222\nTRPH-222 is a novel, site-specific antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting CD22, a B-cell-restricted sialo-glycoprotein that is an important modulator of B-cell signaling and survival, and is expressed on nearly all B-cell malignancies. CD22 is a clinically validated ADC target with potential in Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The compound itself combines a site-specific modified humanized antibody conjugated to a cytotoxic payload using Hydrazino-Pictet-Spengler (HIPSTM) chemistry and a proprietary 4AP linker. Pre-clinical data have shown that this optimization of payload placement and linker composition, combined with the stability afforded by HIPS chemistry, leads to better tolerability and expanded therapeutic index. TRPH-222 is currently in IND enabling GLP studies.\nAbout the SMARTag® Technology\nCatalent's proprietary SMARTag platform, which provides site-specific protein-modification and linker technologies, was developed by Redwood Bioscience to enable the generation of homogenous bioconjugates engineered to enhance potency, safety and stability. The aldehyde tag technology employs natural co-translational modifications found in human cells to create one or more attachment sites at designated positions on protein molecules. These chemical \"handles'' are then stably conjugated to payloads (e.g. cytotoxic or effector) to prevent their systemic release. The SMARTag platform provides precise payload positioning, stable, site-specific conjugation, and defined stoichiometry of drug–protein ratios. The control afforded by the technology enables identification of superior drugs from libraries of differentially designed conjugates. Catalent acquired Redwood Bioscience in 2014.\nCatalent is the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs, biologics and consumer health products. With over 80 years serving the industry, Catalent has proven expertise in bringing more customer products to market faster, enhancing product performance and ensuring reliable clinical and commercial product supply. Catalent employs over 11,000 people, including over 1,400 scientists, at more than 30 facilities across 5 continents and in fiscal 2017 generated over $2 billion in annual revenue. Catalent is headquartered in Somerset, N.J.

The blood-brain barrier, a protective sheath separating brain tissue from its blood vessels, makes it difficult to attack the disease with drugs. It's also difficult to completely remove through surgery, as even tiny remnants inevitably spawn new tumors.\nEven with the best care currently available, median survival time is a dire 15 months, and only 10 percent of patients survive five years once diagnosed.\nThe Duke team decided to pursue an aggressive treatment option to match its opponent, turning to the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium. With a few genetic tweaks, the engineers turned the bacterium into a cancer-seeking missile that produces self-destruct orders deep within tumors. Tests in rat models with extreme cases of the disease showed a remarkable 20 percent survival rate over 100 days, roughly equivalent to 10 human years, with the tumors going into complete remission.\nThen, the Duke engineers made a series of genetic tweaks so that the bacteria would produce two compounds called Azurin and p53 that instruct cells to commit suicide, but only in the presence of low levels of oxygen. And since cancerous cells are multiplying so energetically, the environment around and within tumors has unusually low oxygen.\n2.Granulomatous cystitis-pt treated for severe bladder dysplasia with BCG has now non caseating granulomas in the bladder biopsy\n1.Inhaled heroin- died surrounded by lighters and cigarettes and in his pipe was brown residue.

While being a cancer survivor is a great victory, the disease and treatment can leave survivors with physical, mental, and spiritual challenges after active treatment is complete. The treatment may also change patient's total health situation; he/she may need more careful monitoring by a doctor after treatment is finished. Survivorship services and programs are intended to:\nSince 2009, Franciscan Cancer Care has led and sponsored a community-wide Cancer Survivor Conference. Many community providers and non-profit organizations come together to provide a comprehensive program to meet the needs of cancer survivors. This event offers presentations on side-effects, mindfulness, exercise, nutrition, art therapy, disability, hormone-dependent cancers, sexuality, stress-reduction techniques and other topics chosen by survivors.

The text outlines the concept of neurodynamics and the basic mechanisms in movement of the nervous system and describes what can go wrong. Causal mechanisms are linked to diagnosis and treatment of pain and musculoskeletal problems in a systematic way. Various treatment techniques for each diagnostic category are presented and applied to specific clinical problems such as neck pain, headache, tennis elbow, carpal tunnel syndrome, low back pain to name a few. These are common problems in which therapists often miss a neural component. Table of Contents:1. General Neurodynamics2. Specific Neurodynamics3. General Neuropathodynamics4.

It is there that it hides, and it is their hiding spot that makes it difficult to manage them with simple insecticides. This pesky little beetle is a common insect that attacks conifers and even some broadleaf trees. Bark beetles mine the inner bark on twigs, branches, or trunks of trees and shrubs. They usually attack trees or shrubs that have grown weak. So, if you are concerned over Denver property’s tree or shrubs, contact Lawn Doctor for bark borer treatment. Bark beetles can contribute to the decline and eventual death of trees; however, only a few aggressive species are known to be the sole cause of tree mortality.\nBark Borer Treatment Options in Denver\nIf you have found that Bark Borer beetles have infected your Denver home or business property’s trees and shrubs, you should know of your treatment options. When it comes to bark borer treatments, there are cultural control, biological control, behavioral control, and chemical control options. Cultural control includes making sure you select the right trees and shrubs to plant on your Denver property and reducing the stress of the foliage by taking proper care of it.\nBest Time for Bark Borer Treatment in Denver\nIf going through the chemical control avenue, you will want to consider preventative care options over reactive applications. The application of bark borer treatments after an infestation can often be ineffective. Due to the elevation, it is often best to apply bark borer treatments on Denver properties in late spring. Typically, one application on your Denver property per year can help with season-long control. However, if there are heavy rains, then a second application may be required for effective management against the bark borer beetle.\nTree & Shrub Insect Treatment & Control\nAsh Borer Treatment\nBark Borer Treatment\nContact Lawn Doctor Today\nBe sure to give us a call here at Lawn Doctor for all your lawn care and pest control needs.

(Nasdaq: AFMD), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing highly targeted cancer immunotherapies, announced today that it has entered into a clinical research collaboration in immuno-­oncology with Merck (NYSE: MRK), known as MSD outside the United States and Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, Affimed will fund and conduct a Phase 1b clinical trial to investigate the combination of Merck's anti-­PD-­1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), with Affimed's proprietary drug candidate AFM13 for the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma whose disease has relapsed or is refractory to chemotherapy, including treatment with the marketed antibody-­drug-­conjugate AdcetrisTM (brentuximab vedotin). Merck will supply Affimed with KEYTRUDA for the clinical trial. The purpose of the study is to establish a dosing regimen for this combination therapy and assess its safety and efficacy. Affimed is on track to initiate the study in the first half of 2016.\nAFM13 is a bispecific antibody targeting CD30, an antigen specifically expressed in a variety of T-­ and B-­cell lymphomas and targeting CD16A, an antigen expressed on natural killer (NK-­) cells, which are important for the activation of the innate immune system and the subsequent killing of tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA blocks the interaction between PD-­1 and its ligands, PD-­L1 and PD-­L2, thereby activating T lymphocytes, which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells. In patient-­derived xenograft models, AFM13, in combination with an anti-­PD-­1 antibody, demonstrated impressive synergy, with up to 90 percent of the tumor eradicated. In this preclinical work, conducted at Stanford University, it was also shown that both NK-­ and T-­cells infiltrated the tumors and that cytokine levels, including notably interferon-­gamma, were elevated.\n\"Our development strategy is to combine our NK-­cell engagers with other immunotherapies that could enhance their efficacy through the uptake of both NK-­cells and T-­cells, and the collaboration with Merck is an important step in executing this strategy,\" said Dr. Adi Hoess, CEO of Affimed. \"AFM13, a first-­in-­class NK-­cell engager, has shown an acceptable safety profile and preliminary antitumor activity in the first-­in-­human Phase 1 study. Additionally, preclinical studies indicate that a combination with an anti PD-­1 therapy could act synergistically and represent an additional future treatment option for patients.\"\n\"Evaluating the potential for innovative combination therapies through strategic collaborations in difficult-­to-­treat tumor types continues to be an important part of our clinical development program for KEYTRUDA,\" said Dr. Eric Rubin, vice president and therapeutic area head, oncology early-­stage development, Merck Research Laboratories. \"In partnering with companies such as Affimed, we continue our efforts to bring forward new scientific breakthroughs for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and the field of immuno-­oncology overall.\"\nAFM13 is a first-­in-­class bispecific NK-­cell TandAb®, which binds NK-­cells (natural killer cells) specifically via CD16A and has a second binding domain for CD30, a cancer-­specific target. CD16A is expressed on NK-­cells, highly potent cytotoxic effector cells of the innate immune system, enabling AFM13 to selectively bind these effector cells. AFM13 redirects the NK-­cells to CD30 expressing cancer cells and binds both targets with high affinity, establishing a bridge, whereby the NK-­cells are activated and redirected to kill the cancer cells. AFM13 is designed to treat CD30-­positive malignancies including Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and T-­cell lymphoma (TCL) and it is currently in Phase 2 studies in HL patients. Like all TandAbs®, AFM13 is a stable, off-­the-­shelf, targeted immunotherapeutic which does not require continuous infusion due to a favorable half-­life in a patient's bloodstream, yet is tunable by dosing adjustment when required. This highly specific NK-­cell antibody and the related bispecific platform are unique to Affimed.\nAuthor: Asif Noor, MD; Chief Editor: Russell W Steele, MD\nRocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a tick-borne infection caused by an intracellular bacterium named Rickettsia rickettsii. RMSF is the most common rickettsial disease in the United States.[1] The hallmark of disease process is vasculitis. RMSF is a serious infection with a case-fatality rate of about 10% if left untreated.\nThe most widely used test is immunofluorescence assay (IFA). A 4-fold increase in titers is confirmatory between acute and convalescent stages (collected 2-6 weeks apart). A probable diagnosis can be made based on a single IFA titer of ≥1:64. The sensitivity is low in the first 10-12 days of illness. However, the test is 94% sensitive by 14-21 days.[3]\nProfound hyponatremia is common. Several mechanisms have been postulated, including a shift in water from the intracellular spaces to the extracellular spaces; increased loss of sodium in the urine; and an exchange of sodium for potassium at the cellular level.[4]\nRocky Mountain spotted fever has been a nationally notifiable condition since the 1920s under the category of Spotted Fever Rickettsiosis (SFR). It has been reported in almost every state in the continental United States, with an age-related annual incidence of 0.5-3 cases per million population.[5] In 2000, 495 cases of SFR were reported, while in 2017, more than 6,248 cases were reported, a finding that has been attributed at least in part to increased awareness and testing for the disease, as the percentage of confirmed cases among the total reported, and the case-fatality rate, have both decreased.\nPrior to 2000, Native Americans had rates of Rocky Mountain spotted fever similar to those of other races in the United States.[6] From 2001-2005, rates increased disproportionately (16.8 cases per million vs 0.5-4.2 cases per million for other races). The highest rates were in Oklahoma (113.1 cases per million).[7]\nDarker-skinned individuals tend to have a worse clinical course, probably due to delays in recognizing the rash. Native American have higher rates of incidence, as well as worse outcomes. The annual incidence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever was 277.2 cases per million in the Southern plains, 104.6 cases per million in the East, and 49.4 cases per million in the Southwest regions.[8] Rates described through the national surveillance network are approximately 5-fold lower than those described in the review by Folkema et al.\nThe rash of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is an important pathognomonic feature of the disease and is present in 80-90% of patients. Rash begins as blanching maculopapular lesions. These lesions become petechial or purpuric in approximately one half of patients, accounting for the disease's former name of black measles.[9]\nSerologic assays to detect anti–R rickettsii immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are usually performed for definitive diagnosis.[10] Testing of acute-phase and convalescent-phase sera is recommended to demonstrate a 4-fold or higher increase in the titer.\nCT imaging is typically normal, whereas MRI seems more sensitive at revealing abnormalities. Published findings include diffuse edema, effacement of the sulci, arterial infarctions, prominent perivascular spaces, and enhancement of the meninges (ie typical findings of meningoencephalitis). In a case series of 3 pediatric cases of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) with encephalitis, scattered nonenhancing punctate lesions were described throughout the cerebral white matter, visible on T2- and diffusion-weighted MRI.[11, 12, 13]\nDoxycycline is considered to be first-line treatment for both adults and children and should be started as soon as RMSF is suspected.[14] The use of any other antibiotics has been associated with a higher risk of death (see Table 2, below).\nDoxycycline treatment is most effective at preventing death if it is started within the first 5 days after symptoms begin. As a result, doxycycline treatment should be started before the return of laboratory results and before the manifestation of severe symptoms, such as petechiae. If the patient is treated within the first 5 days of disease, fever generally subsides within 24-72 hours.[14]\nThe recommended dosage of doxycycline for RMSF has not been shown to cause staining of permanent teeth.[15]\nDoxycycline is first-line treatment for both adults and children; antibiotics other than doxycycline increase the risk of death[14]\nThe best outcomes in Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) are achieved when treatment is started within 5 days of symptom onset. Doxycycline is the antibiotic of choice."

        "description": "Kresta In The Afternoon: First ADULT Stem Cell Drug Approved\nThe Maryland Catholic Conference has praised the approval of the first stem cell drug, a therapy for a disease found among bone marrow transplant recipients. Dr. Nancy Paltell, Associate Director for Respect Life Issues at the Maryland Catholic Conference, reacted positively to the news.\n\"Despite all the hype about embryonic stem cell research, it's adult stem cells that are the only stem cells saving lives,\" she said May 22.\nThe Maryland-based Osiris Therapeutics Inc. announced on May 17 that Health Canada has given market authorization to sell the company's therapy Prochymal, which treats acute graft-vs-host disease in children.\nThe complication in bone marrow transplantation can kill up to 80 percent of affected children, who number 3,500 to 4,000 worldwide. The newly transplanted cells attack the patient's body and can cause abdominal pain, hair loss, hepatitis, and lung and digestive tract disorders, among other symptoms.\nProchymal uses bone marrow stem cells from an adult donor and aims to control inflammation while promoting tissue regeneration and scar formation.\nThe Health Canada decision marks the world's first regulatory approval of a manufactured stem cell product, Osiris said. The approval of Prochymal is conditional upon further testing after it reaches the market.\nOsiris plans to apply to the FDA for U.S. marketing authorization by the end of 2012.\nPaltell noted that Prochymal uses adult stem cells, not embryonic stem cells harvested from the destruction of human embryos.\nShe added that the research was not funded by the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund, which has received $79 million of taxpayer money. A \"relatively small amount\" of the fund has contributed to adult stem cell research, which Paltell said explains the lack of patient treatments.\nStem Cell For Heart Disease July 11, 2012 at 12:10 AM\nAdult stem cells from the bone marrow, which is derived from mesoderm, can differentiate into liver, lung, GI tract and skin. It can be induced by modifying the growth medium when stem cells are cultured in vitro or transplanting them to an organ of the body different from the one they were originally isolated from.

Espinoza, PsyD., who earned her doctorate degree in Clinical Psychology from the university. University of the Rockies is a graduate university specializing in master's and doctorate degrees in psychology.\nOf those negative consequences, the stigma attached to soldiers with PTSD was the biggest deterrent to seeking treatment, followed by the fear of being thought of as weak, the fear of being removed from an A-team, the fear of being removed from Special Forces, the fear of being ostracized, the fear of being thought of as a coward, the fear of being discharged from the U.S. Army, the fear of personal distress and the loss of security clearances and job opportunities. The study supports that, of those with PTSD symptoms, only about half will seek treatment due to the stigma attached to PTSD in the military.\n866.621.0124 x2513 - shari.rodriguez@bridgepointeducation.com\nDebbie Mitchell, Mullen Public Relations\n602.222.4343 - dmitchell@mullenpr.com\n1.

This is called recurrence or relapse. It means the return of a sign, symptom or tumour after you've been in remission (cancer-free).\nDealing with a relapse can be just as hard as, or harder than, dealing with your original cancer.\nWhen cancer comes back, it doesn't always show up in the same part of the body – for example, if you had colon cancer, it may recur in the liver. The cancer is still called colon cancer.\nThe different types of recurrence are:\nLocal: which means that the cancer is in the same place as the original cancer or is very close to it.\nRegional: when tumours grow in lymph nodes or tissues near the place of the original cancer.\nDistant: if the cancer has spread (metastasised) to organs or tissues far from the place of the original cancer.\nA recurrent cancer normally starts with cancer cells that the first treatment didn't fully remove or destroy. This doesn't mean that the treatment you received was wrong. And it doesn't mean that you did anything wrong. It just means that a small number of cancer cells survived the treatment. It is also possible to develop a completely new cancer that has nothing to do with your original cancer.\nNot again! Normal reactions to relapse\nIt's normal to feel angry and think 'How can this be happening to me again? Haven't I been through enough??'.\nOther common reactions at relapse are shock, sadness and fear – perhaps the same kind of emotions you had when you were first diagnosed. Read more about dealing with them here.\nHaving to go through treatment again (often more intense), feeling out of control of your body and your life, and worrying about what the outcome will be this time may make you upset and scared.\nJust like the first time, you need to get all the information you need about your relapse and treatment options so you can decide what's right for you.\nTalk about how you feel with a trusted friend or family member or someone in your treatment team. You can also talk to a counsellor here on CanTeen Connect.\nChat with others here on CanTeen Connect about the challenges of relapse\nWrite down your fears, hopes and aspirations for the future in a journal or on a blog.\nStaying positive. You have something now that you didn't have before – experience. You've lived through cancer once. There is no reason why you can't do it again.\nWhile most young people do survive cancer, the sad truth is that sometimes cancer can't be cured.

He said that he expects both companies to enter phase IIb/III studies at the same time in 2021.\nAndrew Cheng, president and CEO, Akero\nIn South San Francisco-based Akero's phase IIa study of efruxifermin, formerly known as AKR-001, the analysis of the secondary and exploratory endpoints showed 48% of patients had fibrosis improvement of at least one stage improvement without worsening in the activity score measurement, while 28% had at least a two-stage fibrosis improvement. Also, 48% of the patients achieved NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis.\nData from the ongoing, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 80 adults showed improvements in treating several NASH co-morbidities. All the dosage groups, each receiving subcutaneous, weekly 28-, 50- and 70-mg doses of efruxifermin or placebo, had a mean weight loss during the 16-week study. The 70-mg dose had a statistically significant body weight loss of about eight pounds at week 16.\nThe study also revealed significant reductions in HbA1c in the 50- and 70-mg dose groups of 0.4 and 0.5, plus improved dyslipidemia that included significant increases in HDL cholesterol and significant triglyceride decreases in all the dosage groups.\nThe Akero study's primary efficacy endpoint is absolute change from baseline in hepatic fat fraction measured by magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction at week 12. The secondary measures include change from baseline at 12 weeks, the number of patients with a decrease of ≥2 points in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score at 24 weeks, and safety and tolerability measures.\nIn Wednesday morning's conference call to investors, Akero's president and CEO, Andrew Cheng, noted that 28- and 50-mg dosage groups appeared to be the likely candidates for the longer-term phase IIb and phase III studies, though he added that no firm decisions have yet been made. Cheng also said the new data showed that efruxifermin could be a \"foundational monotherapy\" for treating NASH.\nH.C. Wainwright and Co.'s Ed Arce praised the new data as \"a real breakthrough in NASH\" while noting the patient numbers were \"rather small\" and need to be confirmed in a larger study powered for statistical significance. The study \"handily exceeded\" his expectations.\nEric Joseph, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, effused similarly by writing Wednesday that he is \"notably impressed by the rate and magnitude of fibrosis\" and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score improvement over a brief treatment period.\n\"Further, we believe depth of fibrosis response increasingly brings the F4/cirrhotic opportunity into view for efruxifermin,\" he added.\nMeanwhile, 89bio expects top-line results from its BIO89-100 phase Ib/IIa NASH proof-of-concept study in the second half of 2020. In April, the company closed enrollment in the double-blind, multiple ascending-dose-ranging trial of 871 patients randomized to receive weekly or every other week subcutaneous doses or placebo for 12 weeks. The study focuses on patients with NASH or with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease who are at high risk of developing NASH.\nThe trial will assess BIO89-100's safety, tolerability and PK properties along with the absolute change from baseline in hepatic fat fraction and proton density fat fraction.\nBIO89-100, the company's lead candidate, is a recombinant human FGF21 analogue that 89bio also plans to develop for treating severe hypertriglyceridemia.\nKEYWORDS 89bio Inc.

However, with 2030 fast approaching, an estimated 785 million people still lack access to clean and safe water. Rural areas within Southeast Asia and the Pacific are particularly vulnerable due to lack of support for implementations of point of consumption (PoC), water security measures.\nHousehold water treatment (HWT) is an effective measure for improving the safety of water at PoC, if centralized water security measures fail. However, HWT is often not a priority for local governments or large NGOs, who may be more focused on community and municipality level interventions. Thus, HWT interventions are often taken up by smaller NGOs passionate about promotion safe water in communities. HWT technology selection and implementation is a complex area to address, as a number of factors need to be considered within the process. Selection of appropriate technology is often aided or justified by decision-making frameworks, of which have unique contextual categories for consideration. The need for support for the decision-making process has resulted in the development of numerous tools within the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene, (WaSH) sector. However, of these tools for selection of \"most appropriate technology/approach/system\", there does not exist a singular decision-making framework for selection of household water treatment technology. The reason for this may be that HWT is not a priority in most contexts, it is a stop-gap, most countries are more focused on wider spread solutions of which do not have the complexity of individual considerations.\nTechnologies may successfully address the water quality concerns and water needs of a user, however, it may not be appropriate to the context. Appropriateness of technology to context is a significant factor to address in determining the sustainability of a solution. The Centre for Appropriate Technology (CfAT), echoes this sentiment by stating, \"a piece of technology or infrastructure has no value without utility to those in the community. It is what we can do with it, rather than the thing itself that is of value. Therefore, the engagement, education and training surrounding the installation or construction of something in a community will determine its success or otherwise.\" Therefore, the ability of solutions to meet the unique needs of the users is subject to external factors beyond the technical capabilities of the technology4. Understanding of these factors and their implications allows for informed selection of technologies most appropriate to context. In collaboration with Engineers Without Borders (EWB)-Australia and the Australian National University, this research aims to investigate the parameters and conditions that should be considered for the selection of household technologies for treatment of water in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, in an ongoing effort to inform decision-making practitioners.\nTo gain understanding of the factors and considerations in HWT technology selection and implementation, we investigated practices in countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Timor-Leste, and Papua New Guinea were selected as they align to where the research collaboration partner, Engineers Without Borders (EWB)-Australia works. Desktop research, and interviews with field experts within the sector and regions were conducted to gain experienced-based requirements of decision-making support tools and current state of HWT. Ten individuals from various organizations provided field insight into HWT within the select countries. Experts included five country-specific experts, three global WaSH advisors, two HWT field experts, two WaSH experts, and one HWT decision tree developer (for their privacy, all interviewees are anonymized in this report). Interviews with experts provided insight into technology procurement, provision, and sustainability of solutions. These data assist in identifying key factors for consideration in selection of HWT options.\nDecision Framework for Household Water Treatment\nThis research was completed as part of the 2020 E4C Fellowship program.

        "description": "Pre-LASIK Examination for LASIK Surgery Procedure in Seattle\nPreparing for the LASIK procedure begins with a pre-LASIK examination. King Lasik offers these examinations to you for free. Your doctor at King Lasik will conduct a full eye exam, asking about your eye history, and verifying that your prescription hasn't changed for at least a year. This exam will ultimately determine whether you're the right fit for a LASIK or PRK procedure.\nYour eyes will be examined, scanned, and mapped during this preliminary exam, ensuring that the LASIK procedure will be as precise as possible. The evaluation process will include a number of steps such as a dilated exam to accurately measure your eye's refractive error or prescription, a corneal topographic map, a glaucoma test, a retinal evaluation, and several other tests.\nIf your eye's health, curvature and corneal thickness are suitable for LASIK, your doctor will let you know if you are a good candidate. If not, refractive surgery could result in unstable or unsatisfactory vision – harming you in the long run – so other vision correction options may be advised. After the exam, you'll talk to a refractive counselor. During this session, you'll be able to ask additional questions, discuss various options and pricing, and schedule your LASIK procedure.\nFew Things to Remember in Preparing for LASIK\nFor example, if you're currently wearing contacts, you'll instead want to switch to glasses during the days leading up to surgery. Hard contact lenses should be removed at least one month prior to the procedure. This is crucial because contacts can distort the shape of your cornea and affect surgical results. You'll also want to leave off eye makeup or cream on both the day before and the day of the surgery to lower the risk of infection.\nArranging for someone to pick you up after the procedure is also essential since the effects of any medicine given to you before the surgery may not have abated yet and your vision may still be blurry. Preparing for the LASIK or PRK procedure in the proper way is very important in order to receive the best results possible.\nSUPERVISOR, SOCIAL WORK SERVICES in San Diego, CA at Scripps Green Hospital\nScripps Green is a 173-bed hospital that has served the La Jolla and greater San Diego communities with distinction since 1977.

These are not new, yet both threats have the potential to grow exponentially in the aftermath of Covid-19.”\nOnly 7% of surveyed experts identified changing health practices and new occupational diseases, including mental health, as a major emerging risk to society, meaning it does not even enter the top 20 most- important threats.\n“Depression affects 264 million people globally.

M. Mason; K. S. Thomas; A. D. Ormerod; F. E. Craig; E. Mitchell; J. Norrie; H. C. Williams\nAuthor Information: Warwick Medical School, University of Warwick, Coventry, CV4 7AL, U.K.\nPyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a painful, ulcerating skin disease with poor evidence for management. Prednisolone and ciclosporin are the most commonly used treatments, although not previously compared within a randomized controlled trial (RCT).\nQuality of life (QoL, EuroQoL five dimensions three level questionnaire, EQ-5D-3L) and resource data were collected as part of the STOP GAP trial: a multicentre, parallel-group, observer-blind RCT. Within-trial analysis used bivariate regression of costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with multiple imputation of missing data, informing a probabilistic assessment of incremental treatment cost-effectiveness from a health service perspective.\nIn the base case analysis, when compared with prednisolone, ciclosporin was cost-effective due to a reduction in costs [net cost: −£1160; 95% confidence interval (CI) −2991 to 672] and improvement in QoL (net QALYs: 0·055; 95% CI 0·018–0·093). However, this finding appears driven by a minority of patients with large lesions (≥ 20 cm2) (net cost: −£5310; 95% CI −9729 to −891; net QALYs: 0·077; 95% CI 0·004–0·151). The incremental cost-effectiveness of ciclosporin for the majority of patients with smaller lesions was £23 374/QALY, although the estimate is imprecise: the probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of £20 000/QALY was 43%.\nConsistent with the clinical findings of the STOP GAP trial, patients with small lesions should receive treatment guided by the side-effect profiles of the drugs and patient preference – neither strategy is clearly a preferred use of National Health Service resources. However, ciclosporin-initiated treatment may be more cost-effective for patients with large lesions.\nPromoting members' public health research, and advocating for the health and well-being of everyone in Australia\nMenu\nAbout\nContribute\nPHAA\nANZJPH\nContact\nSearch for:\nSearch Button\n10 ways we can better respond to the pandemic in a trauma-informed way\nphaahealth October 8, 2021 October 8, 2021 COVID-19, Indigenous health\nPost navigation\nPrevious\nNext\nBy Christina Heris, Australian National University; Catherine Chamberlain, The University of Melbourne; Cindy Woods, The University of Melbourne; Helen Herrman, The University of Melbourne; Janine Mohamed; Michelle Kennedy, University of Newcastle; Shannon Bennetts, La Trobe University, and Simon Graham, The University of Melbourne\nFear is one of the central emotional responses during the pandemic. Every day brings a new level of stress: concerns about getting sick, the stigma of testing positive, financial difficulties due to not being able to work, separation from loved ones in lockdown (or being locked in an unsafe household). The list goes on.\nFor many of us, uncomfortable feelings can be “natural” responses to a “threat”. Our strong, primitive defence or “threat response” (sometimes called “fight, flight or freeze”) has enabled human beings to survive. This stress response is essential for survival against poisonous snakes, crocodiles and other dangerous situations.\nUnfortunately, our “threat responses” are not good at recognising the difference between the “threat” from a crocodile and a pandemic. These responses happen much faster than any conscious thought.\nIt can be particularly hard for people already experiencing complex post-traumatic stress disorder or trauma associated with earlier exposure to severe, repeated and inescapable threats or abuse, often from those meant to protect them.\nAs the pandemic hit last year, we were working on the Healing the Past by Nurturing the Future project, which aims to improve support for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents experiencing complex trauma.\nWe asked ourselves whether the public health response to the pandemic can take into account people’s previous trauma.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the US thought so when it integrated key principles of trauma-informed care into training for its Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response in 2018.\nRead more:\nWhiteness in the time of COVID: Australia’s health services still leaving vulnerable communities behind\nTaking core concepts from our research and guiding principles, we identified 10 principles that may decrease stress or trauma by fostering a sense of security, well-being, confidence, hope and resilience.\n1. Safety\nThe first priority of any emergency or “trauma-informed response” is to ensure physical safety from the immediate threat (like first aid principles). This includes the safety of people most at risk during lockdowns (for example, those experiencing family violence).\n2. Connectedness and collaboration\nHumans are social beings and being “connected” is another essential survival strategy that is more helpful to us in the pandemic than “fighting, fleeing, or freezing”.\nWhen we have social support, it’s easier to take action in an emergency. But it’s not easy staying “socially connected” yet “physical distanced” in an infectious disease outbreak.\nRead more:\nThe community-led movement creating hope in the time of coronavirus\nInequitable responses to the pandemic can also lead to divisions in society, such as when one community appears to receive greater financial support or an unfair allocation of vaccines.\nHowever, looking after each other is our ticket out of here. We have seen this with the global scientific collaborations in the quest to create COVID-19 vaccines.\n3. Compassion and caring\nActs of kindness, compassion and caring are needed more now than ever. Compassion and empathy promote well-being and we know social supports act as a buffer against difficult times.\nUnderstanding stress and distress responses is an important way to “normalise” our feelings, and the actions of others.\n4. Trust and transparency\nClear, compassionate action and transparent communication from governments are also important. These things increase a sense of safety and potential for people to follow public health advice.\nHiding information leads to distrust in government and the media. This can contribute to mistrust in COVID-19 responses and lead to non-compliance.\nA lack of information and exposure to misinformation can also increase distress, and leave people vulnerable to conspiracists who target marginalised groups most at risk.\nRebuilding trust in an emergency may not be possible, but this is where trusted community partners become invaluable mediators and sources of truth for communities.\nRead more:\nVaccinations need to reach 90% of First Nations adults and teens to protect vulnerable communities\n5. Cultural safety and responsiveness\nPublic health approaches and messaging needs to be appropriate and sensitive to local contexts.\nCommunities need health messaging that draws on cultural strengths to increase trust and access to services, such as the way Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-controlled health organisations quickly mobilised to take control of the local response to COVID-19.\n6. Commitment to equity and human rights\nCOVID-19 has not had the same impact on everyone.\nMany people, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander and refugee communities, are affected by historical and intergenerational trauma, racism, and ongoing socio-economic deprivation.\nThese things can be exacerbated in this current crisis. We must address the socio-cultural determinants that can impact people’s health, such as insecure work and housing, and focus on equity.\n7. Good communication\nCrisis communication principles say messages are most likely to be effective when they are clear, credible and interactive, shared consistently, and targeted to community groups.\nThe public may feel the need to seek information to manage their anxiety, but distressing content can also increase their feelings of stress, confusion, and a lack of control, impacting their ability to take action.\nThe media play a critical role here. Accessing trustworthy, reliable information through these channels is important so people know what action to take and where they can go for help.\n8. Positive leadership\nGood governance helps us feel safe.\nIt’s important for the government to be highly visible, provide regular updates and practical support, and help people understand and manage feelings of stress.\nBut we don’t just need leadership from politicians and officials. Local leaders also need to support their communities to process fear, grief and loss, and to help people understand the crisis will pass and there is hope.\nThis was on show when Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-controlled organisations took quick action to protect their communities from COVID-19.\n9. Empowerment\nIndividual and community empowerment comes from having choice, voice, and control. This promotes the confidence to respond to an emergency, as well as resilience, hope and the ability to cope.\nCommunities that are empowered to play an active role in disaster response actually recover better, with lower rates of post-traumatic stress. However, communities must be adequately resourced to do this.\n10. Holistic support\nWe need big responses that address health and safety, social and emotional well-being, community connectivity and cultural responsiveness to improve quality of life, relationships and social functioning.\nHowever, effective emergency responses must be embedded in well-functioning social systems, including emergency social and economic support and high-quality healthcare services everyone can access when needed.\nOur next step will be to discuss these 10 principles with community members and public health experts in an October workshop, to develop a culturally responsive, trauma-informed, public health emergency framework for First Nations communities.\nThis pandemic is far from over and there is now a race to vaccinate communities that have been left behind as states open up. A trauma-informed public health emergency response is possible. And with cases due to rise just as the next bushfire and cyclone seasons arrive, we need one now.\nChristina Heris, Research Fellow, Australian National University;\nCatherine Chamberlain, Professor Indigenous Health Equity, The University of Melbourne;\nCindy Woods, Research Fellow, The University of Melbourne;\nHelen Herrman, Professor, The University of Melbourne;\nJanine Mohamed, Distinguished Fellow and CEO;\nMichelle Kennedy, Senior research fellow, University of Newcastle;\nShannon Bennetts, Research Fellow, Judith Lumley Centre at La Trobe University, La Trobe University,\nand Simon Graham, NHMRC Fellow, Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, The University of Melbourne\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

It is supported by the French Ministry of Culture and collaborates with a host of international academic and art institutions.\nArt by Translation is a postgraduate program that involves 4 artists and curators selected for each year-long session. They attend the program in its different international contexts and contribute to research, participate in seminars and workshops with students from the host cities and produce new works presented in the Art by Translation exhibitions and events.\nEach session's research focus is defined in such a way as to be disseminated across a variety of disciplinary contexts (fine arts, dance, film, writing, art history and theory, architecture, design, etc.). For the first session, the research focuses on the processes and ideological stakes of translation in the arts. The research subjects for following years are defined as extensions or outgrowths of previously developed issues.\nThe program considers the notion of process as a crucial feature for the production and diffusion of critical art and theory. As Mel Bochner has stated, the goal is \"not to make art but to do art.\" The art projects and research experimentations this program seeks to develop are based on a conception of artworks and exhibitions as generative. Research is conceived as a permanent process of translation and dissemination. Art by Translation thus incorporates a flexible approach allowing projects to develop organically in various contexts and in a variety of formats: artworks, architectural constructions, exhibitions, study sessions, workshops, symposia and publications with invited artists and lecturers.\nIts model aims to foster an experimental context for research and art practices. The discussions, debates, and collaborations that typically take place at the margins of exhibitions are expanded and engaged throughout the curatorial process, and materialized as part of the exhibition itself. In foregrounding research and upsetting the temporal limits of curatorial conventions, the program seeks to fill existing gaps in pedagogical and exhibition practices and to propose a model of collaboration among art schools, universities, and exhibition venues with the involvement of artists, historians, theoreticians, and curators across many disciplines.\nThe program tends to break with the conventional chronology of \"research-exhibition-publication\" and aims to reconfigure the boundaries between disciplines. Projects (exhibitions, artworks, texts) are not considered as final results but rather as stages in a process and points of departure for further elaborations. The program creates collaborative situations in which artists and curators produce both individual and collective projects. What is emphasized are the debates and ideas generated by the collaborative situations. Art by Translation produces an evolving research archive that grows and takes on different forms while adapting to different contexts. This archive serves as a basis for interpretation or reactivation rather than constituting an inactive memory of projects. This website presents these archives along with documentation and publications from various events and productions.\nDecember 7, 2017, 7:43 am / knoxhagi681.ampedpages.com\nThe Lasik operation can be a wonderful, life-altering option for lots of people whose vision is less than ideal. There are a number of different types of Lasik operations now available, from the initial and well recorded treatment to Lasik treatments made with 3 dimensional wavefronts, or done entirely with lasers. Each of these variations of the Lasik procedure ought to be talked about with the doctor that is to perform the operation.\nOften checking out the scary stories of the outcomes of a Lasik procedure can deter people from seriously considering such a choice. It is likewise true that the large numbers of people who have a successful, trouble-free Lasik surgical treatment tend not to report a long and detailed story of their experience, unlike those that have experienced problem later.\nIt is good to understand what the possible side effects of the Lasik treatment are, and also the likelihood that one of these side results will happen for a particular client. Much like any medication we take, each has a possible number of side effects, but we typically assume that the likelihood of a severe side effect is little, and we take the medicine anyhow. This article will hopefully put issues of the potential Lasik patient into point of view so that they can calmly and attentively ponder having a Lasik treatment done in the future.\nMore than one million Lasik treatments are carried out in the United States every year, inning accordance with the FDA. This arm of the national federal government has accumulated the following stats for the most common negative effects of the Lasik procedure. These stats will also differ by the physician carrying out the surgical treatment, so ensure to get as much details on the prospective Lasik physician as possible.\nAfter Lasik surgical treatment, 1.7 percent of clients experience some glare or level of sensitivity to light after the operation. This varies by client, however this level of sensitivity is especially noticeable when looking at a brilliant light, such as a streetlight when strolling during the night, or other strong light and dark contrast. Another light related important link side effect is a halo around a light, and this occurs in 3.5 percent of Lasik patients.\nThe new, corrected vision can be discovered quickly by some Lasik patients, in as little as a couple of hours after surgical treatment. The majority of patients that have actually gone through the Lasik treatment find the modification is permanent within a couple of days. In 2.6 percent of customers that have actually had a Lasik procedure done, there is persistent visual variation within a minimum of a part of their sphere of vision.\nFinally, some clients do not get a fully fixed sphere of vision after their Lasik procedure. This occurs with a small number of clients, and the FDA data are that only 3 percent of patients have this result. In all or nearly all cases, the doctor in charge will carry out an extra Lasik procedure to enhance this.\nThis detailing of the significant irreversible negative effects of the Lasik treatment must put any personal scary stories into perspective. Notice that none of the portions are above 3 percent, and this ought to bring comfort to many potential Lasik clients. It needs to also encourage them to look carefully at the Lasik physician's individual record.\nThere are a useful source number of various types of Lasik operations now offered, from the initial and well recorded treatment to Lasik procedures done with 3 dimensional wavefronts, or done completely with lasers. It is excellent to understand what the possible side effects of the Lasik procedure are, and likewise the probability that one of these side impacts will happen for a specific client. Most clients that have actually gone through the Lasik procedure discover the change is long-term within a couple of days. check that Some clients do not get a fully remedied sphere of vision after their Lasik procedure.\nAlso, not the same standard of tests are available everywhere. This has caused different governments and different health authorities to develop different testing guidelines. So the reason why the Window Period is different in Massachusetts is different from Singapore is not because humans in the US react differently to HIV compared to humans in Singapore. It is because of local guidelines.\nThe following graph was prepared based on the latest information on Testing for the Diagnosis of HIV Infection.\n1. If you are within the first 10 days of possible HIV infection (aka the Eclipse Period), don’t bother doing any tests. There are NO tests that are accurate.\nIf the RNA PCR test gives a report of less than 5000 viral copies per ml, it is likely a false positive."

Answers From Doctors - Neuro Section9\nHow Does Anxiety Make You Feel? Answers From Doctors\nSocial Anxiety Disorder: Causes, Symptoms, Management\nSelective Mutism: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment\nPanic Disorder: Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment\nHow does anxiety make you feel and what exactly is it? Feeling anxious is this horrendous feeling in our belly and our hearts that sometimes helps, and sometimes hurts. Feeling fear or anxious is totally normal.\nYou might be curious as everyone is talking about their mental health and anxiety and you don't really know what that feels like. Or maybe, you are walking the line between feeling and being anxious. You might need a little confirmation of what is normal and what is a mental illness.\nFeeling anxious is like a difficult cycle to break from. You worry about taking the train, although you need to take it and maybe nothing will happen. But you worry about being stuck there, and throwing up because it did happen once in your life. You will worry all week until Friday comes, and you need to finally take that train.\nYour anxiety and stress levels are through the roof already, you could not sleep all week. When eventually you do get on the train, there are always two options. You might, or might not throw up.\nHowever, every time you do get nauseous (because of the train or the anxiety) that will confirm your smart brain. However, it is not great at remembering when you don't get nauseous. Why does your brain work that way, and what are the details there?\nAnxiety can come in many sizes and shapes, you can be anxious about thunder, about your kid falling, about your workload or about your health.\nFurther, it is very possible that spiders are not your favorite animal and that you would like to run when you see a needle. Is all this anxiety? You surely are feeling intense fear in all these cases, however it does not mean that you have anxiety disorder.\nIn general, we can conclude that anxiety does not make you like the best version of yourself. Anxiety disorder (or generalised anxiety disorder) comes with physical and mental symptoms. Everyone reacts a little different.\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), made by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), recognizes the following physical symptoms:\nSleep disturbance (trouble sleeping, staying asleep, or unsatisfying sleep).\nFor some, it does not stop there. Many people get diagnosed with anxiety after a visit to the emergency room. They go there as they think they have a heart attack or the pain in their stomach becomes unbearable. Once they are there, there is usually no diagnosis or they first hear that it is mental.\nThey are most likely experiencing a panic attack. A panic attack is an intense moment of fear. It feels like there is a climax after a couple of minutes and goes down again after. Panic attacks can look or feel like:\nA pounding or rapid heartbeat, palpitations\nNauseous, abdominal distress\nDizzy, unsteady, lightheaded\nDerealization (feelings of unreality)\nDepersonalization (being detached from oneself)\nParesthesias (numbness or tingling sensation)\nHeat sensations.\nBasically, this is very logical. Anxiety is a normal reaction of the body trying to protect us against danger or a threat. It is primitive, our brain is smart. It is great at remembering what makes us feel in danger.\nOur fight-or-flight response gets activated. Stress hormones like adrenaline run through our veins, making our body ready to literally fight or flight. Basically, we feel an enormous amount of stress in our body.\nTo survive this threat, we need to think fast, we need warm muscles and be in a zone of high alert. Great, you have espaped this threat. In general, we don't have to run away from wolves or tigers anymore. Today, the threat might have been a car accident, or a very pressing deadline, or traffic.\nWhile some people are very resilient in regressing to a state where your body does not feel stress anymore, others are not.\nMisfortunes never come alone. These physical symptoms usually go together with a range of psychological symptoms. Officially, these are the symptoms recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (or the DSM) and/ or by the ICD.\nMental health anxiety symptoms:\nFree-floating, persistent and excessive worrying or an intense fear\nDifficulty concentrating or the mind going blank\nA feeling of danger or dread, accompanied by the above symptoms without a clear trigger\nThe feeling of nervousness or fear of impending actual or imagined danger\nWhat does this look like in human language?\nMore concrete, you might have thoughts about what is worrying you. It feels like you don't have control over that anymore. In general, these worries are about the future.\nNormal anxiety helps you walk a bit faster at night because you think you might be robbed in the dark. Anxiety that is not functional anymore, makes you not leave your house anymore at all.\nThese thoughts can be about anything and everything, but with anxiety disorder they spin out of control. You can't sleep anymore because you think you will fail a test. These things spin out of control and you have no idea how the anxiety radio off. Life can become too overwhelming, even the things that seem rationally small.\nAnxiety can look and feel different for everyone. Below you can find 7 types of anxiety, recognized by the APA:\nPanic disorder (PD): Anxiety disorder accompanied with a pattern of panic attacks\nSpecific phobias or simple phobias: Anxiety bound by situational phobias like animal phobias, needles, water, small spaces, clowns\nSocial phobia or social anxiety disorder: Anxiety mostly bound to social situations and the evaluation of others\nAgoraphobia: anxiety bound to public transportation, open or enclosed space, standing in line or being outside alone\nSeparation anxiety disorder: Anxiety about losing someone important to you\nSelective mutism: Anxiety mostly for children, resulting in not speaking to others\nOther mental health conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder are no longer categorized as anxiety disorder, but fall under other related disorders.\nWhat is the difference between an anxiety disorder and normal anxiety?\nIn general 'normal' fear or anxiety is because of a real threat or danger. Anxiety disorder is when you feel anxious and it is taking over your daily life.\nWhen your day to day life is compromised by your ruminating thoughts or other mental health concerns, it is time to seek medical advice. A mental health specialist can help you with coping strategies and your anxiety symptoms.\nAnxiety disorders are some of the most common mental health conditions.\nStatistics provided by the National Institute of Mental Health show that 19.1% of adults in the USA were diagnosed with an anxiety disorder in 2016.\nWomen (23.4%) seem to be more sensitive to it than men (14.3%). About 31% of adults will be confronted with any anxiety disorder in their lives.\nAdolescents have more bleak numbers. About 31.9% of them had an anxiety disorder, girls (38%) again scored higher than boys (26.1%).\nSome other statistics by the National Institute of Mental Health:\nseparation anxiety disorder: 1-4% in children of the general population, 6.6% of lifetime prevalence\nSocial anxiety disorder: 9.1% of adolescents, 12.1% of adults over their lifetime\nPanic disorder: 2.3% of adolescents, 4.7% over their lifetime\nHow does anxiety look like in children?\nChildren go through many developmental stages, worrying or being anxious is not necessarily an indication for mental illness.\nChildren should and probably will feel anxiety about the following things:\nbabies & toddlers (0-2 years): strangers, loud noises, costumes, changes, separation, large objects..\nPreschoolers (3-4 years): dogs and animals, the dark, noises at night, monsters and ghosts..\nSchool ages (5+ years): angry teachers, sickness and injurances, nightmares, natural disasters, being home alone, snakes & spiders..\nIf your child can't stop thinking of these or others, seek treatment by a mental health provider. In general they feel stuck, or their behavior has changed (f.e. Extreme shyness).\nWhen to see a doctor or the ER\nYou should see the emergency room when you have suicidal thoughts.\nFurther if you are experiencing panic attacks (or an anxiety attack) or physical signs that concern you, you should go to the ER as well. They can confirm by medical test if these are symptoms of anxiety disorders or panic attacks or if these physical health problems are due to a physical illness.\nA doctor can provide medical advice in case of an underlying health issue.\nWe are not entirely sure what causes generalized anxiety disorder. We do know that anxiety is a normal and healthy stress response, until the moments that the things that trigger anxiety or not a threat anymore and they have an influence on our everyday life.\nGenetics might play a role, as do other medical symptoms like heart diseases, diabetes or others. A big reaction to stress or chronic stress don't help either. Lastly, there might be associations with other psychosocial factors like a traumatic event, shyness or a personality with perfectionistic and obsessive tendencies.\nYou can undertake some steps to take care of your mental health before seeing a doctor.\nThere is general advice that can lower the risk of developing anxiety disorders:\nnot abusing drugs and alcohol\neating a complete and healthy diet full of grains, fruits and vegetables\nnot drinking too much coffee\nand getting enough sleep.\nHowever, this will not solve all problems. It is essential that you try changing up your lifestyle as well. You need to pay attention to lowering your stress levels and taking care of your mental health in other ways.\nOther ways to lower your anxiety disorder symptoms or get a handle on your stress levels can be:\nphysical exercise. f.e. yoga\nvisiting friends and family, or support groups.\nUsually a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy and medication (f.e. anti anxiety medication like benzodiazepines, SSRIs, SNRIs or monoamine oxidase inhibitors) is prescribed to treat anxiety disorders.\nAnxiety is a normal stress reaction in life. It is biological, our body and brain gets ready for a threat. And it is also mental, your thoughts are stuck. You keep worrying and it is difficult to put your thoughts on the side.\nAnxiety can have an intense impact on your personal, professional and academic life. It does not need to stop you from living your life.\nTo come back to your normal functioning state, you need to treat the disorder. Medicine and therapy help a lot. Join a group, talk about it, see a therapist that will be able to coach you through and get the right treatment.\nGet help as soon as possible when anxiety hits you hard or if it becomes an everyday worry\nChildren, adolescents and adults can suffer from anxiety. There is no shame in admitting that you might suffer from one of these anxiety disorders. As you can see, it is very common.\nThere are many types of anxiety like generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety, specific phobias and many more.\nadmin, Author at K Friedman Consulting - Page 2 of 4\nMarch 18, 2017 in Drug Products /by admin\nIf you are selling a drug product in Canada you are most likely familiar with the term \"DIN\" which stands for Drug Identification Number.

The PRIMROSE 2 trial enrolled 535 women with uterine fibroids. The trial was conducted in Europe and the US, and evaluated the efficacy and safety of once daily oral linzagolix, including 100 mg and 200 mg doses, both with and without hormonal add-back therapy (ABT). The primary efficacy endpoint was the reduction in HMB; responders were defined as patients with menstrual blood loss volume of ≤ 80 mL and a 50 percent or greater reduction from baseline in menstrual blood loss volume at 24 weeks, measured using the alkaline hematin method. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured centrally via Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) scan at baseline and 24 weeks. The responder rate was 93.9% (p < 0.001) for patients receiving 200 mg with ABT and 56.7% for patients receiving 100 mg without ABT (p < 0.001), compared to 29.4% in the placebo group. Both doses achieved significant rates of amenorrhea (p< 0.001), reduction in pain (p < 0.001), and improvement in quality of life (p < 0.001). Additionally, significant improvement (p< 0.001) in Hb levels, a reduction in number of days of bleeding and reduction in uterine volume were observed. A significant reduction in fibroid volume was also observed for the 200 mg dose with ABT (p < 0.001). The overall safety profile was in line with expectations. The most frequently observed adverse events (occurring in > 5% of patients) were headache, hot flushes, and anemia. Mean percentage change from baseline in BMD was consistent with the previous trial.\nNeonatal Worksheets - Trip Database\n1. Neonatal Worksheets\n2.

In the first place, however, stress and stress hormones form an adaptive system that allows us to react quickly and effectively to sudden dangers. Research suggests that chronic stress at an early age could have a negative effect on emotional learning and memory.

During this period medical records of children attending Comprehensive Care Clinic at Kenyatta National hospital were reviewed daily. HIV infected children aged 5-144 months were enrolled if they had received antiretroviral drugs for at least 6 months with available and complete laboratory results.\nMedical records of 337 children meeting enrollment criteria were included in the study. The median age was 63 months with equal male to female ratio. Following 6 months of HAART, prevalence of anemia (Hemoglobin (Hb) <10 g/dl) declined significantly from 35.9 to 16.6 % a nearly 50 % reduction in the risk of anemia RR = 0.56 [(95 % CI 0.44, 0.70) p < 0.001]. There was significant increase in Hb, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and platelets above the baseline measurements (p < 0.0001) and a significant decline in total white blood cell counts >11,000 cell/mm(3) but a none significant decrease in red blood cells (RBC). Pre-HAART, World Health Organization (WHO) stage 3 and 4 was associated with a ten-fold increased likelihood of anemia. Chronic malnutrition was associated with anemia but not wasting and immunologic staging of disease.\nHematological abnormalities changed significantly within 6 months of antiretroviral therapy with significant increase in hemoglobin level, MCV, MCH and platelet and decrease in WBC and RBC.\nChanges of hematological parameters; Hematological abnormalities; Paediatric HIV infection\nCaregiver oral rehydration solution fluid monitoring charts versus standard care for the management of some dehydration among Kenyan children: a randomized controlled trial.\nBaseline Haematological Indices among HIV-1 Infected Children at Kenyatta National Hospital\nManagment of immune thrombocytopaenia in children: a review\nCharacterisation of community acquired non-typhoidal Salmonella from bacteraemia and diarrhoeal infections in children admitted to hospital in Nairobi, Kenya Samuel Kariuki, Gunturu Revathi, Nyambura Kariuki, John Kiiru, Joyce Mwituria, and Charles A Hart\nInvasive multidrug-resistant non-typhoidal Salmonella infections in Africa: zoonotic or anthroponotic transmission?J Med Microbiol. 2006 May;55(Pt 5):585-91.PMID: 16585646 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] Kariuki S, Revathi G, Kariuki N, Kiiru J, Mwituria J\nShimmer and ClearSky Partner to Provide Insights for CNS Diseases - Physical Therapy Products\nShimmer and ClearSky Partner to Provide Insights for CNS Diseases\nPosted by Deborah Overman | Jun 19, 2019 | Multiple Sclerosis | 0 |\nShimmer Research and ClearSky Medical Diagnostics announce they are partnering to bring a new level of analytic capabilities to the use of wearable sensors in clinical research.\nThis partnership will employ the Verisense wearable sensors platform, which has been designed specifically for use in clinical research, with ClearSky algorithms and machine learning to transform wearables data into actionable insights for central nervous system (CNS) diseases.\nWorn on the wrist, the Verisense Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor is designed to capture biometric data, such as activity and sleep. It can be used for any IMU application with up to seven sensors worn on different parts of a participant's body to aid researchers in studying complex musculoskeletal or neurological conditions, such as dystonia or epilepsy.\nClearSky Medical Diagnostics specializes in developing technologies for the diagnosis and monitoring of Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative conditions. Its clinically validated medical devices have been used in medical centers worldwide and in clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of new drugs.\nFor example, ClearSky's LID-Monitor can distinguish Levodopa-induced dyskinesia from Parkinson's tremors, allowing doctors to optimize Levodopa dosage. This approach significantly improves patients' quality of life and also saves time and money due to the reduction in consultations required, a media release from RANA Healthcare Solutions explains.\n\"The Verisense platform is truly a breakthrough for conducting clinical research,\" says Dr Stephen Smith, co-founder of ClearSky Medical Diagnostics, York, England, in the release. \"It can provide the continuous raw data from wearables needed for sophisticated algorithms, yet places almost no burden on the participant or the clinical site. It has multiple layers of redundancy and quality checking to ensure that high-quality data are collected without interruption.\"\n\"ClearSky's algorithms can be used with Verisense data right away,\" states Geoff Gill, president of Shimmer Americas, Cambridge, Mass, \"but what we are really excited about is the potential for our clinical research customers to leverage ClearSky's experience and datasets to develop endpoints for a wide variety of CNS disorders based on Verisense data.\n\"ClearSky has taken raw motion data and transformed it with machine learning into actionable insights for physicians in a wide range of applications. This experience is ideally suited to develop endpoints for diseases like Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's, and many others using real-world data,\" he adds, in the release.\nTammany West Charles Marsala Explains Medicare Part D - Tammany West\nCharles Marsala Explains Medicare Part D\nCharles Marsala January 11, 2015 0\nIndividuals on Medicare are eligible for prescription drug coverage under a Part D plan if they are signed up for benefits under Medicare Part A and/or Part B.\nBeneficiaries obtain the Part D drug benefit through two types of plans administered by private insurance companies: the beneficiaries can join a standalone Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) for drug coverage only or they can join a public Part C health plan that jointly covers all hospital and medical services covered by Medicare Part A and Part B at a minimum, and typically covers additional healthcare costs not covered by Medicare Parts A and B including prescription drugs.\nAbout two-thirds of all Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled directly in Part D or get Part-D-like benefits through a public Part C Medicare Advantage health plan. Another large group of Medicare beneficiaries get prescription drug coverage under plans offered by former employers.\nGenerally, not all drugs are covered at the same out of pocket cost to the beneficiary. This gives participants incentives to choose certain drugs over others.\nBeneficiaries already on a plan can choose a different plan or choose to drop Part C or Part D during an annual enrollment period or during multiple other times during the year. Currently, the annual enrollment period lasts from October 15 to December 7 of each year.\nMedicare beneficiaries who were eligible for but did not enroll in a Part D when they were first eligible and later want to enroll, pay a late-enrollment penalty, basically a premium surtax, if they did not have creditable coverage through another source such as an employer or the U.S. Veterans Administration.\nThis article is for informational purposes only.

Of interest has been the study on how these control instruments describe and illustrate the concept of citizenship and the related concepts. The study highlights the content that is expected to be taught compared with the actual experiences from citizenship education research.\nIn this research, textual analysis is used as a method to review the structure of the text and to scrutinize the content.\nFrom the analysis of the national steering documents, it is possible to argue that young people in Sweden have the opportunity to both learn about democracy and be active citizens. It can also be argued that students have the opportunity to be a part of the democratic working framework in practice, which can prepare them for active participation in society later in life. However, this research does not give any answer to whether what is political rhetoric in documents is also the educational outcome of the pedagogical practice.\nFull Text:\nPDF\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.5296/jse.v3i2.3321\nRefbacks\nThere are currently no refbacks.\nCopyright (c)\nJournal of Studies in Education ISSN 2162-6952\nEmail: jse@macrothink.org\nCopyright © Macrothink Institute\nTo make sure that you can receive messages from us, please add the 'macrothink.org' domain to your e-mail 'safe list'.

Read to find out what could be the outcome related to vitamin D deficiency.”\nAsthma is an auto immune condition of the system that deals with the respiratory system. This is associated with allergic reaction or other form of hypersensitivity. During the reaction bronco spasm occurs that causes difficulty in breathing. In asthma wheezing occurs i.e. a whistle sound while breathing with tightness of the chest. This is accompanied with shortness of breath and coughing as well. Coughing usually occurs either during early morning or at night. Asthma can occur at any age mostly occurs during childhood. People with asthma must carry an inhaler with themselves in case of an emergency attack. Vitamin D intake is one of the most effective home remedies for asthma to ease its symptoms and also to prevent asthma attack.\nA research was carried out on a group of people who were asthmatic and the article published in the allergy journal has revealed that, individuals suffering from asthma who had a decreased level of vitamin D in their body were 25% more likely to be attacked by asthma then the ones whose vitamin D level was within the normal range.\nThese findings still remained the same even after the other risk factors for asthma like smoking, obesity etc were being assessed by the team.\nInflammation is a protective response by the body’s immune system which occurs in order to get rid of the harmful stimuli or the pathogens in the body ad even the damaged cells of the body. The signs of inflammation are rubor, calor, dolor and tumor i.e. redness, heat, pain and swelling. According to these signs the initial change that occurs is the appearance of redness which followed by a wheel and flare formation that is a red ring like formation. After this that area feels heated and painful this ends end in swelling in the end. It is found that one of the best foods that fight inflammation are mostly rich in vitamin D.\nIt has been found that vitamin D deficiency is associated with inflammation, which is a negative response.\nIt is found that low levels of vitamin D have been associated with certain autoimmune diseases like lupus erythmatosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis etc.\nCholesterol is a waxy compound found the body cells. Cholesterol and its derivatives are important constituents of the cell membrane but increased level of bad cholesterol I n the blood can lead to atherosclerosis. There are two kinds of cholesterol in the body a good one and a bad one. The good one is known as HDL or high den.\nDensity lipoprotein which helps to prevent the arteries from blocking by removing the bad cholesterol that is LDL or low density lipoproteins from there.\nIt has been seen in a population research that low levels of vitamin D are associated with high levels of cholesterol. Though this has not proven any cause and effect relationship.\nAccording to a research carried out on 2012 it showed that high level of vitamin D was not associated directly to lowering down of cholesterol in the body but infact it showed increase in the level of LDL in the body.\nTherefore, now the final verdict according National Health Institute says that there cholesterol so far.\nSunlight is a very important source of vitamin D because it leads to the conversion of precursor vitamin D into vitamin D\nAnother good source of vitamin D is fatty fish sardines etc. Fish is already a food that is recommended to be taken twice a week.\nAnother source of vitamin D is egg yolks. Eggs are healthy foods which enclose good amount of nutritional values.\nFatty liver disease is the accumulation of triglycerides and other fats in the liver cells. | Homepage\nFatty liver disease is the accumulation of triglycerides and other fats in the liver cells. The amount of fatty acid in the liver depends on the balance between the processes of delivery and removal. In some patients, fatty liver may be accompanied by hepatic inflammation and liver cell death (steatohepatitis). Potential pathophysiologic mechanisms for fatty liver include the following:\nPrevious PostLung cancer is a disease in which certain cells in the lungs become abnormal and multiply uncontrollably to form a tumor.Next PostLassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness caused by the lassa virus.\nJames O.

Only unpublished manuscripts are to be submitted.\n· Author(s) must avoid conflict of interest over attribution of academic credit, it is helpful to decide early on in the planning of a research project who will be credited as authors, as contributors, and who will be acknowledged. For this reason, conflict of interest must be clearly stated.\n· All errors discovered in the manuscript after submission should be communicated to the editor as they are discovered.\n· All authors must take public responsibility for the content of their paper. The multidisciplinary nature of much research can make this difficult, but this can be resolved by the disclosure of individual contributions. Careful reading of the targeted journal, advice to authors is accepted in the light of current uncertainties.\n· During submission, author(s) should state that the study they submited was approved by the relevant research ethics committee or institutional review board. If human participants were involved, manuscripts must be accompanied by a statement that the experiments were undertaken with the understanding and appropriate informed consent of each. If experimental animals were used, the materials and methods (experimental procedures) section must clearly indicate that appropriate measures were taken to minimize pain or discomfort, and details of animal care should be provided.\n· Author(s) should include information about research funding in all papers they prepare for publication.\n· Authors should inform journals if they discover errors in published work.\n· Authors have a right to appeal editorial decisions\nBasic Research Journals Reviewers Guidelines:\n· All manuscripts under the care of Basic Research Journals are reviewed in fairness based on the intellectual content of the paper regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, religion nor political values of author(s).\n· Observed conflict of interest during the review process should be communicated to the Editor.\n· All information pertaining to the manuscripts under the care of Basic Research Journals are kept confidential.\n· All information that may be the reason for the rejection of publication of a manuscript should be communicated to the Editor.\n· A submitted manuscript should not be retained or copied.\n· Reviewers and editors should not make any use of data, arguments, or interpretations, unless they\n· Reviewers should provide speedy, accurate, courteous, unbiased and justifiable reports.\nBasic Research Journals Editors Guidelines:\n· Editors decisions to accept or reject any manuscript for publication should be based only on the paper's importance, originality and clarity.\n· Editors must treat all submitted manuscript with utmost confidential.\n· Editors should inform peer reviewers about any form of Misconduct.\n· Editors should encourage peer reviewers to consider ethical issues raised in the research they are reviewing\n· Editors should request additional information from authors if they feel it is required.\n· Editors should exercise sensitivity when publishing images of objects that might have cultural significance or cause offence.\n· Editors should inform readers if ethical breaches have occurred.\n· Editors should encourage peer reviewers to identify if there is a conflict of interest with the material they are ask to review, and editors should ask that peer reviewers to decline invitations requesting peer review where any circumstances might prevent them from producing fair peer review.\n· Editors may choose to use peer reviewers suggested by authors, but should not consider suggestions made by authors as binding.\n· Editors should mediate all exchanges between authors and peer reviewers during the peer-review process (i.e. prior to publication). If agreement cannot be reached, editors should consider inviting comments from additional peer reviewer(s), if the editor feels that this would be helpful. Journals should consider stating in their guidelines that the editor's decision following such an appeal is final.\n· Decisions made by editors about whether to publish individual items submitted to a journal should not be influenced by pressure from the editor's employer, the journal owner or the publisher.\n· Editors should publish corrections of errors detected that could affect the interpretation of data or information presented in an article.\n· Editors should expect allegations of theft or plagiarism to be substantiated, and should treat allegations of theft or plagiarism seriously.\n· Editors should protect peer reviewers from authors even if peer reviewer identities are revealed, should discourage authors from contacting peer reviewers directly, especially if misconduct is suspected.\n· Editors should reserve the right to reject papers if there is doubt whether appropriate procedures have been followed. If a paper has been submitted from a country where there is no ethics committee, institutional review board, or similar review and approval, editors should use their own experience to judge whether the paper should be published. If the decision is made to publish a paper under these circumstances a short statement should be included to explain the situation.\n· Editors should aim to ensure timely peer review and publication for papers they receive, especially where, to the extent that this can be predicted, findings may have important implications.\n· The Editorial Board takes responsibility for making publication decisions for submitted manuscripts based on the reviewer's evaluation of the manuscript, policies of the journal editorial board and legal action acting against plagiarism, libel and copyright infringement.\nBelongings Pointers To Use When Marketing Your Rehabilitation Center-Addiction treatment centers no insurance near florida - homepage\nBelongings Pointers To Use When Marketing Your Rehabilitation Center-Addiction treatment centers no insurance near florida\nContent by-Thrane FyhnMaking your dependency treatment and therapy organisation successful is a big endeavor for a solitary owner to pursue. https://www.facebook.com/119390944855290/posts/1703801763080859/ won't immediately find the very best way to market their services.

The primary objective of most PSRs is to undertake a detailed and comprehensive review of the safety of the plant, taking into account operational safety, the possible deleterious effects of ageing, and also advances in safety standards since the original construction or time of the last review.\nPeriodic safety reviews are usually complementary to the normal regulatory reviews that are carried out, e. g. between fuel cycles and do not affect them. PSRs have developed\nfor a number of reasons. Public confidence has diminished and regulatory requirements have become more stringent over the past decade or so driving a demand for higher standards of safety not only in new plants, but also in currently operating plants. Perhaps rather more importantly though, experience has shown that there are positive benefits from PSRs to both safety and performance and they are supported by both operators and regulators.\nA list of safety issues identified for PSRs is given in Table 3.8 together with a frame­work for review that was endorsed by the 1991 IAEA Safety Conference (Goodison, 1997).\nA review of experience of PSRs has been published in CEC Working Group (1990) and Goodison (1997). It concludes that PSR practices show considerable commonalties. This is particularly so within the EC due to similarities in regulatory regimes within the EC countries. At the top level, the procedure is broadly similar. There is agreement of the scope between the licensee and the regulator. The licensee undertakes the review, implements the modifications and reports to the regulator. The procedure is then followed by review by the regulator and the identification of any further modifications. Finally agreement is reached between the licensee and the regulator on how to fulfil the agreed programme.\nThe differences in PSR practices depend mainly on the methodology, the standards and scope that are adopted. These differences might relate to the standards for radiological protection or on the level of redundancy and diversity of the safety systems. The criteria for PSAs are also not universally agreed. There are also differences in the periodicity requirements for PSR reviews.\nThe potential benefits of PSAs include improved safety via the implementation of modifications to an improved safety level (closer to that of a modern plant), including the\nTable 3.8. Safety issues to be addressed in PSRs\nSafety issues Recommended procedures for assessing each issue\nAssess each issue with current methods to determine the safety status Compare the safety status with current standards Identify shortfalls\nAssess the safety significance of any\nshortfalls and carry out remedial measures Implement practicable modifications and assess safety significance of remaining shortfalls Repeat for each issue\nGain indication of safety level compared with modern plant and identify shortfalls from current safety standards and best practices Improve plant routine operations including optimisation of maintenance, test and inspection techniques and improve plant availability Identify strengths and weaknesses of personnel\nGain improved understanding of plant safe working life and life-limiting causes Improve regulator confidence in the continued safe running of the plant, improve the licensee's confidence for future planning and investment and improve national public and international confidence\nGoodison (1997).\nidentification of short-falls in present practices and improved confidence (in the regulator, operator, public, etc.) (Table 3.9).\nThe first comprehensive review of the plant is usually the most demanding. Subsequent reviews would be expected to be quicker (and cheaper). Initial PSRs, of very old plants may require extensive modification or possibly result in closure. For future plants, initial PSRs might be expected to be less onerous."

The digestive tract has been destroyed, allowing undigested meals and other harmful intruders to enter the bloodstream and harm the immune system. It is not a medically recognized condition, but the research that supports the theory of leaky gut treatment Melbourne syndrome and related disorders is compelling. It may offer an alternative treatment option for many people suffering from chronic illnesses such as irritable bowel syndrome, food intolerances and allergies, eczema, asthma, autoimmune conditions, and mood disorders.\nLeaky gut syndrome is a medical disorder where the stomach lining becomes too porous. It harms the digestive tract and lets uncooked meals and undesirable microbial material into circulation. It is a digestive illness linked to various conditions, including autoimmune disease, asthma, allergies, mood swings, fibromyalgia, chronic tiredness, hormone disorders, food intolerances, and eczema. The usage of pain relievers, acidic beverages, GMO foods, antibiotics, and alcohol are potential causes of leaky gut syndrome. You may have leaky gut syndrome if you have difficulty eating, have persistent stomach pain, or experience regular indigestion.\nYou should have your symptoms evaluated by a skilled physician who can advise you on the best treatments and remedies.

This equates to 20 necessary minerals and trace elements and 14 harmful heavy metals. It scans the palm of your hand to measure and discover shortages and excess levels.\nSo, How Exactly Do Oligoscan Work?\nThe OligoScan uses Photospectometry to detect the distinct signature of each element, mineral, and heavy metal. This works because each substance absorbs or reflects a different quantity of light at a particular wavelength. The OligoScan detects this light, absorbs it with the Spectrophotometer, and generates a numerical result that it then analyses. The test is brief, and the findings are immediate. All that is necessary is the palm of your hand, where we may swiftly scan four locations, as seen in the figure below.\nThe live blood analysis Melbourne is a fantastic tool for discovering the mysteries hidden inside your blood cells.

This study was conducted at the University of Rizal System-Morong Campus during the First Semester of School Year 2009-2010 with 15 PDPR professors and 30 second year students of Bachelor of Technology major in Hotel and Restaurant Management as the respondent-evaluators in the study. Descriptive-experimental method of research using the questionnaire-checklist and test results in gathering data was used in the conduct of the study. The PDPR professors validated the modules based on the following criteria: objectives, subject matter, organization and presentation, language and style and usefulness of the module. Pretest-post test design was used to determine the performance of the control and experimental group in which the students were equated and divided into two groups. Mean, standard deviation and rank distribution were used as statistical tools in treating the data. T-test was utilized to test the significant difference between the mean performance of the control and experimental group as revealed by the post test results. It was found out that the modules in PDPR were very much valid as an instructional material. This is shown in the high performance of the experimental group as revealed in their pretest and post test results. The modules in PDPR were perceived to be very much effective by students and professors.\nRowena de los Reyes Laroza, Ed.

General Recommendations: Anthrax is not spread from person to person and there is no need to isolate the patient.\nNasal swabs are not a clinically useful tool for diagnosis of anthrax and are not recommended.\nB. General Signs and Symptoms of Anthrax\nCutaneous Disease: usually begins as a small papule, which enlarges and progresses to a vesicle or bulla in 1-2 days. The vesicles may become hemorrhagic, with satellite vesicles. The lesion then ulcerates and forms a black eschar (necrotic ulcer) in 3 to 7 days. The lesion is usually painless and the tissue surrounding the skin lesion is often erythematous, and may have varying degrees of edema (brawny, gelatinous, non-pitting edema). Patients may have fever, malaise, headache and regional lymphadenopathy. The case fatality rate for cutaneous anthrax is 20% without and < 1% with antibiotic treatment. Cutaneous anthrax is not easily transmissible from person to person, although there is a very low risk of infection if there is direct contact with the drainage from an open sore. The incubation period is usually from 1-7 days, but may range up to 15 days. Inhalational Disease: classically presents as a brief prodrome resembling a viral respiratory illness followed by development of hypoxia and dyspnea, with radiographic evidence of mediastinal widening. However, in some recent cases of inhalational anthrax, patients have presented with acute onset of fever, dry cough, and hilar or mediastinal adenopathy and lung infiltrates or pleural effusions. URI symptoms have been absent. Chest x-ray may have evidence of mediastinal widening, but chest CT scan may be more sensitive for mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Meningitis can occur, and the spinal or pleural fluid may be hemorrhagic. However, blood and pleural fluid cultures may be negative, and diagnosis may need to be made by additional studies such as PCR, serology, or immunohistochemistry available only at reference laboratories at the CDC. Inhalational anthrax is the most lethal form of anthrax, and symptoms can progress quickly to respiratory failure or shock. The incubation period of inhalational anthrax among humans is unclear, but it is reported to most often range between 1 and 7 days, and on rare occasion can extend out to 60 days post exposure. Case-fatality rate estimates for inhalational anthrax are based on incomplete information regarding exposed populations and infected populations in the few case series and studies that have been published. However, the case-fatality rate is high, and early treatment, in the prodromal stage, is much more effective in preventing severe illness and death. NJDHSS requests that all providers seeing patients with a non-specific, febrile flu-like illness obtain a thorough employment history, including whether the patient is a postal worker or handles mail, and ask about any exposure to suspicious letters or powders in the preceding week. High-risk groups are defined as any of the following: Postal workers, especially if they work or spend time in (a) a mail distribution center where automated sorting machines are operating or (b) in a New Jersey postal facility.\nEmployees of media corporations or other high-profile companies/institutions (e.g., government organizations), especially if they routinely handle mail. Persons reporting a potential high-risk exposure to contaminated powder in the week prior to illness onset (e.g., aerosolization of powder when opening or handling a letter deemed to be a credible threat; criteria for a credible threat include an envelope containing powder that is either (a) addressed to a high-profile person or corporation and/or (b) if the letter contains a written threat). Healthcare providers who see patients in one of these high risk groups presenting with a recent onset (i.e. within the preceding 7 days) of a non-specific febrile, flu-like illness should consider the possibility of early inhalational anthrax infection. C. A suspicious case of CUTANEOUS ANTHRAX is defined as: Any person with a highly suspicious skin lesion: An ulcerative lesion with surrounding edema or vesicles,\nA blackened eschar forming 3 to 7 days after onset of skin lesion.\nAny person with a less suspicious skin lesion: An ulcerative or necrotic lesion, AND\nA risk exposure history. At this time, this includes postal workers or delivery persons in regular contact with postal facilities.\nAny person with a less suspicious skin lesion: An ulcerative or necrotic lesion AND\nLaboratory evidence suggestive of possible B. anthracis infection. Examples include: Gram stain showing positive bacilli from a skin lesion, sterile fluid, or tissue Culture showing encapsulated non-motile, non-hemolytic bacilli from any body fluid or site.\nAll patients with a skin lesion characteristic of cutaneous anthrax, with or without a known exposure, should have a complete blood count and blood cultures drawn (prior to the administration of antibiotics), and then be treated presumptively with antibiotics and referred to a physician, such as a dermatologist, who is experienced in the management of ulcerative lesions. Ciprofloxacin or doxycycline should be given until susceptibilities are known. If the isolate is susceptible, penicillin or amoxicillin are acceptable alternatives. If laboratory testing is positive for cutaneous anthrax, treatment should continue for at least 14 days (treatment may need to be extended for 60 days if there was a known aerosol exposure).\nD. A suspicious case of INHALATIONAL or meningeal anthrax is defined as a patient with:\nSepsis or respiratory distress with a widened mediastinum or pleural effusion, especially if hemorrhagic.\nSepsis with gram-positive rods OR a suspicious Bacillus species identified in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. To assist in the diagnostic work-up, providers should obtain blood cultures (obtained prior to the administration of antibiotics), a complete blood count and a chest radiograph (to evaluate for mediastinal widening and/or pleural effusions) to diagnose possible early inhalational anthrax infection.\nE. Evaluation of Patients:\nNasal swabs are not recommended for determination of anthrax exposure or assessing need for post exposure prophylaxis. Nasal swabs and blood serum tests are used as epidemiological tools to characterize an outbreak when there is a known confirmed biologic agent in an environmental sample. Nasal swabs are not diagnostic tools for anthrax in asymptomatic people, and a positive or negative nasal swab test gives no information on whether a person is infected.\nAsymptomatic patient WITHOUT known exposure to a confirmed culture-positive letter/package or environmental sample: Antibiotic prophylaxis is ONLY recommended at this time for postal workers, and persons who visited inside the mail sorting area, such as business visitors, to the Hamilton or West Trenton postal facilities, since September 18, 2001. These guidelines will be updated as more information is available.\nAsymptomatic patient WITH potential exposure to a confirmed culture-positive letter/package/environment: Public health authorities should be consulted to determine whether post-exposure prophylaxis has been recommended for the potential exposure. See below section for antibiotic prophylaxis recommendations. Decontaminating the patient, other than by routine washing with soap and water, IS NOT indicated or recommended. Patients with symptoms/signs compatible with anthrax WITHOUT a known, confirmed culture-positive environmental exposure: Confirm/rule out the diagnosis by obtaining the appropriate laboratory specimens based on the clinical form of anthrax that is suspected (inhalation or cutaneous)\nSee guidelines below for appropriate specimen collection for the diagnosis of anthrax infection. In a suspected case of anthrax, you must notify your state and local health departments immediately. In particular, a high index of suspicion should be maintained for postal workers, and unexplained febrile respiratory illness or unusual or unexplained cutaneous lesions in postal workers should be reported to the state and local health departments.\nPhysicians should also consider other diagnoses and treat accordingly. Based on the clinical assessment, treatment that includes antibiotics effective against anthrax should be included. Patients with symptoms/signs compatible with anthrax, WITH a known, confirmed culture-positive environmental exposure: Confirm/rule out the diagnosis by obtaining the appropriate laboratory specimens based on the clinical form of anthrax that is suspected (inhalation or cutaneous)\nSee guidelines below for appropriate specimen collection for the diagnosis of anthrax infection. In a suspected case of anthrax, you must notify your state and local health department immediately.\nBegin antibiotic therapy that is effective against anthrax\nIn light of the ongoing outbreak of intentional anthrax associated with contaminated letters, the NJDHSS requests that physicians maintain an increased level of awareness for the occurrence of milder illness that may represent the early warning symptoms of inhalational disease among persons at higher risk for exposure to aerosolized anthrax spores from contaminated letters. NJDHSS requests that all providers seeing patients with a non-specific, febrile flu-like illness obtain a thorough employment history, including whether the patient handles mail, and ask about any recent exposure to suspicious letters or powders. TESTING FOR ANTHRAX AND USE OF POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS IN NEW JERSEY\nThe recent bioterrorist attack causing an outbreak of anthrax in several states, including New Jersey, has stressed the resources of the public health care system. Part of that stress is a result of some misconceptions on the part of health care providers and the public that must be addressed to eliminate the inappropriate use of tests and antibiotics that could lead to adverse effects among patients. This addresses those issues and is directed at health care providers to assist them in their efforts to manage their patients in a medically sound approach, given our current knowledge.\nThe NJDHSS discourages the use of nasal swabs for assessing patients concerned about exposure to anthrax as they are not a clinically useful tool. The use of nasal swabs in recent investigations in Florida, NYC, DC, and New Jersey has been for epidemiologic purposes, in order to help determine where suspicious letters were handled in the work area around a confirmed case. The results have been used to guide further investigation and to determine the source of exposure, and to make overall recommendations on prophylaxis for persons involved at the site regardless of individual nasal swab test results.\nThere is no screening test available for the detection of anthrax infection in an asymptomatic person. The sensitivity and specificity and clinical value of nasal swab testing for an individual patient are unknown. The presence of anthrax spores in the nose only indicates recent exposure and has no predictive value regarding the number of spores inhaled or infectious status of the individual. In addition, nasal swab tests may be reported preliminarily as positive for Bacillus species but may ultimately be negative for B. anthracis when tested in the State Lab.\nSerologic tests are available at reference laboratories such as the CDC, but are only performed in symptomatic individuals with a clinical picture consistent with inhalational or cutaneous disease. Serology is not used as a screening or preliminary test in individuals. Preliminary blood tests in symptomatic individuals being evaluated for anthrax, should instead focus on blood cultures (BEFORE antibiotic therapy).\nThe New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS) continues to strongly urge physicians NOT to prescribe post exposure prophylactic antibiotics for persons who are not among the groups recommended for this. At this time, those recommended for PEP are the following: Postal workers or business visitors to the work areas at the Route 130 Mail Processing Facility in Hamilton Postal workers at the West Trenton Postal Facility in Ewing Township Although we recognize the heightened concern regarding the threat of bioterrorism with the unfolding events of the past several weeks, antibiotic therapy in asymptomatic individuals should be limited to persons with a known risk exposure.\nHOW TO REPORT A SUSPICIOUS CASE OF ANTHRAX:\nCall the NJDHSS immediately at: 609-588-7500, off hours at 609-392-2020 or the Emergency Operations Center at 609-538-6030\nPlease have the following information, if available: Patient name Patient contact information Medical history Illness onset date Characteristics and progression of skin lesion Presence of systemic symptoms Treatment history Laboratory and radiologic data Detailed exposure and employment history This information will be used to help determine the patient's risk for anthrax infection. When you call to report a case, we will help to determine whether further testing is necessary.\nA. If it is determined that the patient is a SUSPICIOUS CASE OF CUTANEOUS ANTHRAX the patient should be evaluated by a dermatologist or another physician experienced in the evaluation of ulcerative lesions. If this physician assesses the lesion to be suspicious, the specimens detailed below will be requested. Laboratory testing at the CDC will be prioritized for selected cases only. NJDHSS will arrange transport of the diagnostic specimens from your facility to the NJ Public Health and Environmental Laboratories (PHEL) ONLY AFTER THE CASE HAS BEEN REVIEWED BY NJDHSS. Microbiologic cultures of suspected B. anthracis can be sent to the PHEL.\nFor SUSPICIOUS CASES OF CUTANEOUS ANTHRAX, recommended specimens include: Culture and gram stain of skin lesion or skin biopsy for testing at your routine microbiology laboratory: Synthetic (non-cotton) swab with non-wooden stick for culture and gram stain of material swabbed from the exudate or the most actively inflamed area of the eschar.\nSterile punch biopsy specimen should be sent in sterile saline for culture Send to routine hospital laboratory. If suspicious Bacillus species is identified, contact NJDHSS immediately. Two skin biopsies for PCR, culture and immunohistochemical staining at CDC:\n(If only one biopsy is obtained, it should be placed in formalin). One biopsy specimen in formalin, kept at room temperature, for histopathology and immunohistochemical staining. Paraffin-embedded specimens are acceptable as well. One biopsy specimen in a sterile cup, frozen at -70 C or placed on dry ice, for culture and PCR.

If it is determined that the patient is LESS LIKELY TO BE A CASE OF CUTANEOUS ANTHRAX, i.e., the patient has skin lesions in which cutaneous anthrax is on the differential diagnosis, BUT the clinician does not strongly suspect it AND/OR there is low or no risk exposure history AND/OR there is no existing laboratory evidence of Bacillus infection, referral to a dermatologist is recommended. Laboratory testing for cases that are less suspicious for anthrax should be performed using local medical laboratories.\nFor post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment recommendations see website at http//www.cdc.gov.\nSusceptibility results have been performed on the isolates from New Jersey, Florida, New York City and Washington, DC, and all are sensitive to penicillin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin. Susceptibilities of the isolate to ceftriaxone and erythromycin were considered intermediate. (Note: Naturally occurring Bacillus anthracis is generally resistant to extended spectrum cephalosporins). The CDC reports that susceptibility data indicates the presence of a cephalosporinase and suggests the presence of a penicillinase as well. Therefore, CDC advises against using penicillin or penicillin-class drugs alone for treatment of anthrax infections. More detailed information on the revised antibiotic recommendations for management of anthrax exposures is available at MMWR site at cdc.gov.\nFor patients presenting to hospital emergency departments carrying suspicious material with them, the following are recommendations on handling these materials: DO NOT PANIC\nShower with lots of soap and water as soon as possible.

Ketamine and cognitive function in depression: detrimental, neutral, or advantageous? J Clin Psychiatry. 2022;83(1):21com14243.\nTo share: https://doi.org/10.4088/JCP.21com14243\n*Corresponding author: Joseph F. Goldberg, MD,128 East Ave, Norwalk, CT 06851 (joseph.goldberg@mssm.edu).\nSee article by Vaccarino et al\nCognitive function remains one of the lesser-appreciated outcomes in clinical intervention trials for mood disorders—despite the fact that impaired attention, executive function, and processing speed are commonly associated with depression.1,2 Monoaminergic antidepressants have collectively shown modestly positive, though inconsistent, effects on cognitive function during treatment for major depression; effect sizes tend to be small, and domains other than psychomotor speed and delayed recall may not show appreciable impact.3 The field has long sought to identify antidepressant interventions that can improve domains of cognitive function associated with depression, or at the very least spare any worsening of cognitive performance as often occurs with anticholinergic or antihistaminergic compounds.\nIn this issue of the Journal, the review of cognitive effects associated with ketamine treatment for major depression by Vaccarino et al4 is especially timely and pertinent on several levels. First, interest in the use of ketamine as a novel intervention for treatment-resistant depression has grown enormously in the past few years: a MEDLINE search of the linked terms major depression and ketamine finds a tripling of annual citations from 2013 to the present, and currently there are over 200 worldwide studies related to ketamine and depression registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Although the mechanisms of action of ketamine are diverse,5 ketamine's effects on glutamate modulation via blockade of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor are still thought to contribute to its antidepressant efficacy; however, randomized trials with a number of other NMDA receptor antagonists in major depression (such as memantine, riluzole, or rapastinel) have yielded mixed results.6 In principle, ketamine is believed to exert neuroprotective effects by stimulating synaptogenesis through neurotrophic pathways such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) in the prefrontal cortex.7\nSecond, despite enthusiasm about the aforementioned putative mechanistic actions, there has been little consistent information about whether ketamine is associated with predictably beneficial, detrimental, or neutral effects on cognitive function. Vaccarino et al4 note from their review that, at present, the available data do not reveal a procognitive effect when ketamine is efficacious in the treatment of depression—although the absence of evidence does not prove the evidence of absence. No prospective trials with ketamine have, as yet, been conducted with cognitive function as a primary or coprimary outcome measure in major depression, limiting the ability to test the hypothesis that ketamine could improve cognition or assess whether an interaction may exist between improvement in depression and cognitive function. Herein lies a major methodological conundrum based on the existing literature: the available data preclude knowing when cognitive improvement (as has been noted in several open as well as randomized trials) might be a pseudospecific artifact of improvement from depression or when it might be a standalone consequence of ketamine, or whether there may be instances in which depression symptoms could improve but adverse cognitive effects nevertheless emerge iatrogenically (as often occurs after electroconvulsive therapy [ECT]). Dedicated studies are needed to parse these important distinctions, as was done in trials of vortioxetine in major depression (in which path analyses showed an independent procognitive drug effect while controlling for changes in depression symptoms over time).8\nThird, and perhaps most compelling, are data separate from the present undertaking which show that patients who chronically abuse ketamine demonstrate deficits in executive function and visual/verbal memory as compared to healthy controls, who appear to recover after 12 weeks of abstinence from ketamine.9 Neuroimaging studies among adolescent- and young adult–onset chronic ketamine abusers reveal decreased gray matter volume in a number of cortical and subcortical regions,10 raising the question of whether, under certain conditions, high-frequency dosing of ketamine poses possible neurotoxic, rather than neuroprotective, effects. Note also that existing trials of intravenous (IV) ketamine in major depression generally focus on a dose of 0.5 mg/kg, with less known about the safety and efficacy of higher doses; it is hard to draw inferences about cognitive effects (either good or bad) from higher parenteral doses, or from variable oral doses taken by substance use disorder populations. Further complicating matters is the reality that most observational studies of patients who chronically abuse ketamine often include individuals who also use other illicit psychoactive substances.\nPragmatic questions linger about the cognitive safety of long-term prescribed ketamine or esketamine for depression. Maintenance treatment with intranasal esketamine is standardly prescribed initially twice weekly and ultimately no more often than once or twice a month. In the US Food and Drug Administration registration trials for esketamine in major depression, secondary outcomes involving serial cognitive assessments were performed but have not yet been reported. While Vaccarino et al4 found no evidence of adverse cognitive effects from a single ketamine infusion, multiple infusions (studied only up to 6 infusions over 2 weeks) in major depression patients, or use during ECT, little information exists about long-term frequent infusions—leaving unanswered the question of whether high frequency of administration could be a mediating factor that influences cognitive neutrality versus detriment. For parenteral racemic ketamine, no guideline exists for the use or duration of repeated long-term dosing, even though some practitioners advocate multiple infusions weekly over the course of several weeks.11 The absence of long-term randomized data with IV ketamine limits the ability to anticipate the risk for long-term adverse cognitive effects. An additional pragmatic concern is that some clinicians, again on a purely anecdotal or theoretical basis and with no empirical trials database, sometimes advise the use of compounded oral ketamine lozenges between infusions as a possible strategy to buttress a sustained antidepressant effect. Apart from the low bioavailability of oral ketamine (about 10%–20%),5 existing data to support meaningful antidepressant efficacy are mainly limited to retrospective reports, with none addressing cognitive safety.12\nThere is presently no guideline on the best management strategy for relapse prevention after an initial response to IV ketamine. No other NMDA antagonist or other pharmacology has shown a clear maintenance effect to sustain euthymia, understandably prompting many clinicians to analogize from the literature on maintenance ECT and advocate repeated maintenance ketamine infusions, following the general dictum of \"what gets you well keeps you well.\" While long-term repeated ketamine infusions are increasingly becoming the norm to prevent relapse after a response in major depression, a formal database is urgently needed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing frequency of repeated ketamine infusions in order for such well-intended practices to become evidence-based.\nIn sum, the review by Vaccarino et al4 points out existing gaps in knowledge about the cognitive impact of ketamine in major depression, juxtaposed with potential adverse effects seen in substance abuse or healthy control populations. Their findings remind us of the many unknowns that remain regarding the safety of frequent repeated long-term infusions, the possible mediating effect of changes in depression on changes in cognition, concerns about subpopulations that may be at greater risk for adverse cognitive effects, and the need for properly designed long-term randomized trials focusing on cognition as a primary or coprimary outcome.\nPotential conflicts of interest: Dr Goldberg has been a consultant for BioxCel, Intracellular Therapies, Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Lundbeck, Otsuka, Sage Pharmaceuticals, and Sunovion; has been on the speakers bureau for AbbVie, Alkermes, Intracellular Therapies, and Sunovion; and has received royalties from American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc, and Cambridge University Press.\n1.

After all, there have been many stories over the years about air conditioning systems in hotels, office buildings and shopping centres, transmitting this severe form of pneumonia to its patrons and often with severe symptoms!\nWhat many people don’t realise is that Legionnaires’ disease can also be spread through poorly maintained home water heaters. Sound a bit scary? It doesn’t need to be. There are some easy ways to avoid the growth of Legionnaires’ disease in hot water and they don’t involve spending a lot of money or vacating your house.\nFirstly, what is Legionnaires’ disease?\nContents\n1 Firstly, what is Legionnaires’ disease?\n1.1 What are the symptoms of the disease?\n2 Why is Legionnaires’ disease a risk for home water heaters?\n2.1 How to avoid Legionella in your water heater and protect you and your family\nLegionnaires’ disease is a respiratory disease that can cause a type of pneumonia deriving from a bacterium known as Legionella. While Legionnaires’ disease isn’t contagious through person to person contact, you can catch it through inhaling the Legionella bacteria from other sources like poorly maintained air-conditioners, residential hot water systems and swimming pools.\nThe important thing to know about the Legionella bacteria is that it spreads in water. It multiplies when temperatures are between 20-45°C.The bacteria are dormant below 20°C and can’t survive above 60°C.\nWhat are the symptoms of the disease?\nThe bacterium also causes Pontiac fever, a milder illness that’s similar to the flu. Legionnaires’ disease usually develops two to ten days after being exposed to the bacteria. Symptoms include fever, gastrointestinal issues, chest pain, shortness of breath and even confusion. Legionnaires’ disease is not usually fatal if caught early and can be treated with antibiotics. If you display these symptoms and think you might have been exposed, you should go to your doctor straight away. The earlier it’s caught, the easier it is to treat and less likely there will be any complications.\nWhile anyone can develop Legionnaires’ disease, some are more at risk, depending on a number of factors. The older you are, the more likely you are to catch the disease. If you’re a smoker, alcoholic or have existing illness such as cancer, diabetes, chronic respiratory or kidney disease where your immune system is weakened, your chances of becoming infected multiplied. For people at high risk, prompt\ntreatment is critical.\nWhy is Legionnaires’ disease a risk for home water heaters?\nWhile many people associate the disease with commercial environments, in a home setting, people can get sick by inhaling droplets of Legionnaires’ disease in hot water from the infected tank while showering. Less commonly, you can get sick through aspiration of drinking water containing the bacteria if the water accidentally goes into the lungs while drinking.\nHow to avoid Legionella in your water heater and protect you and your family\n1. Keep your water heater set to a minimum of 60°C to prevent the growth of Legionnaires’ disease in hot water\nYour plumber will know to set up your system to run at 60°C when your heater is installed. We recommend you to leave the temperature gauge as it was set by your plumber, just to be safe. And don’t worry about scalding. Tempering or mixing valves are used to prevent injury by adding in cold water – but only after the hot water leaves your tank. Plumbers will set the valve to deliver water at 50°C to your hot water tap.\n2. Don’t turn your hot water heater off or turn the temperature down – ever!\nTurning the temperature down on your hot water tank to reduce costs should be avoided as it can create the perfect conditions for the bacteria to grow. When going on holidays, some people might also turn off their water heater to save costs. This should also be avoided for the same reasons.\n3. Flush your systems once a year to rid systems of build-up and debris\nSediment can collect at the bottom of a neglected hot water tank. This can also be a breeding ground for the Legionella bacteria. A properly maintained tank can also help prolong your water heater’s life and prevent malfunctions.\n4. Stagnant water favours Legionella bacteria growth\nTo reduce this risk, you should flush out infrequently used outlets regularly and clean and de-scale your showerheads a few times a year. If possible, removing dead legs/dead ends in pipework will also avoid stagnant water which can harbour the Legionella bacteria.\n5. Consider continuous flow hot water heaters\nAnother solution is to install a continuous flow water heater. As these systems are tankless, there is nowhere for the Legionella bacteria to grow and multiply. These systems also never run out of hot water – another bonus!\nPreventative maintenance is something Hot Water Specialists specialise in.
