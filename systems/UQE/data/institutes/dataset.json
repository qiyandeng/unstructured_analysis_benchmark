The smaller fish, like sardines, are a great source of low-fat, high-quality protein, and are very low in mercury or PCBs, which have been shown detrimental to your health.\nHealth Booster #3: Oats or Oatmeal\nSteel-cut oats are a perfect source of complex carbs, protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals.\nOf course you know that fiber is good for your health, but did you know that oats, which naturally contain beta-glucan, have been shown to be a great source of fiber?\nBeta-glucan is a naturally occurring fiber that, when introduced to your body, has been shown to lower cholesterol, blood pressure, weight, and help improve blood sugar levels – which could protect your heart, digestive, and overall health.\nPlus, the fiber in oats has been shown to decrease appetite and could lower energy intake at meals throughout your day (lunch and dinner).\nOats are full of minerals like tryptophan, manganese, and phosphorus, plus they have a good serving of B vitamins.\nHaving a cup of oats in the morning could leave you feeling full all day, which could reduce your belly fat, therefore potentially improving your health.\nHealth Booster #4: Mushrooms\nAs strange as it may sound, including more mushrooms in your diet could improve your health as you get older.\nMushrooms, in all varieties, deliver a big plate of nutrients in a tiny, bite size fungus.\nMushrooms have been shown to be an immune system stimulant, plus they have also been shown to fight or prevent certain types of cancer.\nMushrooms are also a great source of the B vitamins – B2, B3, and B5 – which could be beneficial in mood, blood sugar control, energy levels, and cholesterol levels, just to name a few.\nPlus, mushrooms have plenty of minerals that are necessary for your body to function at its best.\nHealth Booster #5: Tomatoes\nTomatoes, another low-calorie favorite, are full of heart-healthy vitamins and minerals.\nTomatoes have high levels of the antioxidant lycopene, which has been shown to reduce your risk for cancers, heart disease, and could boost sperm count.\nYes, lycopene, according to some research, could be important for increasing your sperm concentration.\nPlus, this tasty little vegetable has plenty of phenolic acid, which has been shown to prevent some instances of lung cancer.\nOne more benefit of tomatoes: they are available year-round, which means you can get plenty of lycopene at all times and seasons of the year.\nAging can be associated with a decline in health - from heart health, brain health, and everything in between.\nHowever, taking the right steps now, exercise and stress relief, plus including these five essential foods, could protect your health and lead to a longer, healthier life.\nThe phenomenon of restless legs syndrome is a neurological disorder whose causes are still unknown. It occurs during sleep, rest or inactivity, and is highly favored by a sitting or lying position. Symptoms tend to be worse in the evening and night, and also worsen with age. Please note that some drugs may be responsible for symptoms related to this disease.\nUnpleasant tingling, muscle contractions or small electric shocks are felt periodically in the lower limbs. They are accompanied by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs. In fact, the symptoms tend to disappear quickly when the patient changes position or starts walking, the latter being often necessary to allow patients to fall back to sleep. During the night, sudden and uncontrolled shaking of legs may also disturb sleep or may have an impact on the overall quality of sleep.\nTo temporarily relieve these problems, a patient should walk, stretch, perform leg movements, and occasionally massage the leg muscles. For a more in-depth treatment, there are various medications that can be prescribed if the restlessness proves to significantly interfere with sleep and the quality of everyday life: anticonvulsants, sedatives, anxiolytics or analgesics in case of severe pain.\nThe causes are still poorly identified; prevention requires above all a change in lifestyle habits, which may potentially alleviate the symptoms. The advice that is currently given is to have a healthy and varied diet, to reduce the consumption of caffeine, alcohol or tobacco, if possible reduce potential stress factors, and lastly to engage in regular physical activity.\nPublished by Jeff.

Thank you for the explanation 🙏\nLower back and low back pain, and body heat are not typical signs of pregnancy. These complaints can also arise due to other causes, such as hormonal changes before menstruation, fibromyalgia, fatigue, viral or bacterial infections, intestinal inflammation, pelvic inflammation, and so on. If you view from the results of your ultrasound examination that shows the condition of an empty uterus and the results of your beta hCG examination that is less than 5 mIU / mL, chances are you are not currently pregnant.\nDelay in menstruation is one of them can be caused by pregnancy. However, besides that, there are many other conditions that can also cause menstruation to come late, for example due to stress, fatigue, obesity, extreme diets, side effects of birth control or other drugs, ovarian cysts, thyroid gland disorders, and so on. Ascertain whether the delay in menstruation has anything to do with pregnancy or you can not do with a testpack, blood tests, until the ultrasound as you have done. Ideally, this checkup is indeed done after a delay in menstruation, at least 1 week, or more.\nEven though it's unlikely, your test results that don't show signs of pregnancy may be due to the time of the examination is too early. To confirm this, you can do a re-examination in 2 to 4 weeks. As an initial management, you can first improve your lifestyle so that it is healthier, namely by getting enough rest, eating more antioxidant-rich foods (for example vegetables, fruits, and whole grains), don't stress, drink enough, and be diligent in exercising . To reduce pain in the back and lower waist, you can first apply warm water compresses. Meanwhile, to relieve your body heat, you can take the drug Paracetamol first.\nIf within 2 to 4 weeks your menstruation still does not come, you can go back to see a doctor or obstetrician to find out the cause of your complaints.\nAnswered: Jul 29 '20 at 05:00 by HealthReplies.com\nFrequently Peed And Golden Yellow Foamy Urine?\n, if you urinate frequently, then urine foaming and golden yellow is that a sign of symptoms of kidney disease?...\n, I want to ask what's the difference between Nexium 20mg and Nexium Mups 20mg from AstraZeneca factory ?? r nAre they the same? r nThank you...\nNational Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA\nCorrespondence to Dr Roderick J McClure, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA; rmcclure{at}une.edu.au\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1136/injuryprev-2017-042355\nStatistics from Altmetric.com\nRequest Permissions\nIf you wish to reuse any or all of this article please use the link below which will take you to the Copyright Clearance Center’s RightsLink service.

However, the rapid development of new injury prevention knowledge is quickly outstripping society’s capacity to implement it.4 This supplement of Injury Prevention brings together examples of empirical-based injury prevention research that demonstrate the state-of-the-art methods of achieving population-level reductions in injury-related harm. The issue also includes contributions that make the case for expanding existing public health paradigms of injury prevention beyond ‘what works’ and towards understanding the contexts and supports necessary for embedding effective injury prevention interventions within sustainable, synergistic systems of safety promotion.\nPopulation health science is one orienting frame for understanding and addressing the conditions that shape large-scale distributions of injury outcomes. Galea and Keyes5 describe how population health science can inform public health action in terms of ‘what works’ and ‘when’ and ‘for whom’. They pose a series of considerations injury researchers can use to both uncover the …\nView Full Text\nFootnotes\nFunding The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.\nDisclaimer The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the CDC.\nOne of the most widely used and administered antiretroviral drugs is Truvada. However, this drug has multiple side effects which include osteoporosis as well as kidney failure. Many people know about these side effects, however, the manufacturer is guilty of withholding information about improvements that would help to reduce or eliminate some of these side effects. As a result, if you or someone that you care about has suffered from the side effects of using this drug, then you can make a claim and be compensated once your Atlanta Truvada lawsuit is successful.\nYou deserve compensation for damages and illnesses caused by taking this drug. So, you should definitely give an Atlanta tort lawyer a call who can help you with your claim. Of all the attorneys available, Dalimonte Rueb Stoller is definitely the best law firm to call.\nTable of Contents\nTruvada – What is it?\nTruvada is a medication that is made by Gilead Sciences. It is made up of Emtricitabine and TDF (Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate) which are antiretroviral drugs. This drug can also be used by people who have a high risk of being exposed to HIV and it is also a PrEP drug for people who currently have HIV or AIDS.\nWill The Use Of Truvada Result In Kidney Issues?\nKidneys are responsible for breaking down different antiretroviral medications and it is one of the most important organs in the body. As a result, people who suffer from HIV need their kidneys to work effectively. Many HIV patients typically suffer from a variety of kidney issues, however, when they use Truvada, this actually decreases the health of their kidneys or even worsens any pre-existing kidney conditions which can result in chronic kidney disease, renal failure, etc.\nAccording to a study done by the University of California in 2012, they determined that the probability of developing chronic kidney disease increased by 33% every year for those who used Truvada. However, upon stopping this medication, the risk and symptoms of kidney disease due to the use of Truvada still remained for about a year.\nDoes Truvada Also Cause Bone Injuries?\nGilead Sciences currently has numerous lawsuits from people who used this drug and this company is seen as having the majority of the market share when it comes to HID/AIDS drugs. Many past users have seen TDF related bone loss after using this drug which means that their overall bone mineral density reduced. It is clear that users of this drug deserve much better and safer medication.\nIf you’re looking for a highly reliable Truvada attorney in Atlanta, then look no further than Dalimonte Rueb Stoller. They are ready to represent anyone who has suffered due to taking Truvada and currently has illnesses such as osteopenia, bone density loss, osteoporosis, etc because of Truvada. You don’t have to worry about paying us if we take up your Truvada case with TDF bone loss since we charge only on a contingency fee basis. Basically, you don’t have to worry about paying us until we have won your case and you’ve received your rightful compensation.\nWhat are Side Effects of Truvada?\nThere have been numerous studies that show that the consistent and continual use of antiretroviral medicine, leads to many side effects which include osteoporosis, kidney disease, bone fragility, etc.\nBasically, bone problems start to occur once the mineral density in the bones decreases at a much faster rate than is typical. This then leads to bone degeneration that is faster than the body can regenerate. This then results in loss of strength as the mass of the bones decreases. Additionally, the use of Truvada and similar drugs cause an increase in the risk of developing renal failure and other kidney problems, especially in HIV patients.\nSome of the other TDF drugs like Truvada include Stribild, Symfi Lo, Atripla, Viread, etc. However, the latest versions of these drugs don’t have the side effects and huge risks that Truvada has. Unfortunately, Gilead Sciences have put off releasing new and updated drugs to Truvada because they want the patent to be prolonged.\nThere are lots of lawsuits that have been filed in the U.S. and they all seek compensation due to the side effects and serious damage caused by Truvada. No matter what the side effects are attorneys have filed complaints against this company so that they can compensate patients who have suffered and continue to suffer because of using Truvada.\nTypical kidney issues that occur due to using Truvada:\nRenal failure (severe)\nKidney failure (partial or total)\nFanconi syndrome\nKidney disease (chronic)\nKidney injury (severe)\nDeteriorating kidney function\nBone issues due to using Truvada:\nFractures\nDental issues\nTooth decay\nLoss of teeth\nOsteoporosis\nOsteopenia\nLowered bone density\nHave There Been Any Truvada Lawsuits?\nThere have been numerous lawsuits against Gilead Sciences that have been filed by HIV/AIDS patients. All of these patients used the medications manufactured by Gilead Sciences and suffered from the above side effects and illnesses. As of April 2019, there are 41 lawsuits that have been filed against this company and Truvada. They were all filed as personal injuries.\nSo, if you or someone that you care about has suffered or is suffering from side effects due to drugs taken from Gilead Sciences such as Truvada, then you can file a lawsuit against them. The side effects include serious medical conditions, severe pain, and disease which deserve compensation, which also includes the medical bills incurred through seeking treatment for these side effects.\nGilead Sciences Willful Delay Of Improved And Safer Drugs\nThere is a lawsuit that was filed in May 2018 against this company where the victim accused Gilead Sciences of delaying the release of improved TDF drugs that don’t have such severe side effects. Additionally, many users also complained that the company did not sufficiently warn them of these side effects, even though they knew of these side effects as far back as 2001.\nClass Action Lawsuit Against Gilead Sciences & Truvada\nIn April 2019 a class action lawsuit was filed by 41 users of Truvada who suffered from its side effects such as kidney damage, bone damage, osteoporosis, etc. for rightful compensation.\nTruvada Lawsuits\nAdditionally, numerous legal complaints have also been filed against this company due to the side effects they suffered by taking this company’s HIV drug. Additionally, these people also indicated that they were diagnosed with fractured bones, kidney issues, kidney failure, etc because of taking Truvada.\nHow Much Will Filing an Atlanta Truvada Lawsuit Cost Me?\nWe charge all personal injury cases on a contingency basis. Basically, you won’t have to pay any money unless we have won the case for you and you’ve received your compensation.\nIt should be noted that the contingency fee depends on the status of the case when your attorney is successful in getting compensation for you. The fee is usually a portion of the total settlement fee and it varies according to the lawyer, their experience as well as how much time and energy they put into the individual case. These types of personal injury cases usually require a team of lawyers as well as medics in order to develop the case and this means that the fee will be a bit higher.\nIf You Have Questions, Call Dalimonte Rueb Stoller Today!\nMany more lawsuits are currently being filed against Gilead Sciences as a result of their drugs such as Truvada, concealment of information, and side effects of this drug as well as the delaying improved drugs with fewer side effects. Essentially, they are responsible because if they had been truthful and not succumbed to greed, then many people would be healthier and their lives would have been saved.\nWith that said, not all of these cases are the same and each one will be judged individually.

Acne is a multifactorial disorder, and stress potentially plays a role in its pathogenesis. Objectives. We aimed to assess the serum levels of neurotensin in patients with acne vulgaris (AV) and investigate the relationship of these levels to quality of life (QoL), depression, anxiety, and stress. Methods. The study included 60 patients with AV classified into mild (n=20), moderate (n=20), and severe (n=20) groups and 20 healthy, age-matched, sex-matched, and body mass index (BMI)-matched individuals in a control group. Patient QoL was assessed using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Each participant completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Serum levels of neurotensin were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results. Neurotensin levels and scores from the three questionnaires were significantly higher among the patients with AV than the control subjects. They were also significantly elevated in patients with post-acne scars and hyperpigmentation and in those with severe acne. Conclusion: It is well known that acne greatly impacts QoL and might be associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Further, serum neurotensin could be a promising marker to objectively evaluate the psychosocial impact of AV.\nKeywords: Acne, anxiety, depression, neurotensin, quality of life\nAcne vulgaris (AV) is a widespread multifactorial disorder of pilosebaceous elements, and its pathogenic factors (i.e., follicular hyperkeratosis, increased activity of sebaceous glands, microbe hypercolonization, inflammation, and immune response) are commonly known. Psychological factors have become a subject of special concern, and stressful situations are discussed as possible triggering factors of acne.1 Adolescent patients with acne have reported low self-esteem and symptoms of depression, leading to a lower quality of life (QoL). Psychological comorbidities, including depression and anxiety, have largely been associated with AV, but it is unclear whether AV is the cause, or if it only worsens the preexisting conditions.2\nNeuropeptides are present in the skin, where they might play a role as neurotransmitters and trophins.3 In the present work, we aimed to assess the serum levels of neurotensin in patients with AV and investigate their relationship to QoL, depression, anxiety, and stress as evaluated by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), respectively.\nMethods\nSubjects. This case control study was approved by the local ethics committee on research involving human subjects of Benha Faculty of Medicine. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before sample collection.\nThe study included 60 patients with AV classified into three groups (mild, moderate, and severe acne) with 20 patients in each group. In addition, 20 apparently healthy, age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched subjects were included as a control group. Subjects were recruited from the dermatology outpatient clinic in Benha University Hospital. Pregnant and lactating women and patients suffering from any chronic skin or systemic diseases, concurrent psychiatric illness, or receiving any regular psychotropic medication or antidepressant drugs were excluded from this work.\nAll patients were subjected to a detailed history taking and physical examination to evaluate the clinical type and severity of acne using the Global Acne Grading System (GAGS).4 The patients’ QoL was assessed using the DLQI, a validated questionnaire containing 10 questions evaluating symptoms, feelings, and the impact of the skin condition on daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment.5\nEach participant completed the HADS, which assesses depression and anxiety,6 and the PSS-10, which assesses the stress experienced by the patients.7 Serum levels of neurotensin were measured for all enrolled subjects using the Human Neurotensin (NT) ELISA Kit (INOVA; Beijing, China) Cat No. CSBE09144h, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nStatistical analysis. The collected data were summarized in terms of mean±standard deviation (SD), median and range for quantitative data as appropriate, and frequency and percentage for qualitative data. Comparisons between the different study groups were carried out using the Fisher’s Exact Test (FET) to compare differences between proportions, and the Student’s t-test (t) and the Mann-Whitney test (Z) were used to test differences between two groups regarding parametric and nonparametric data, respectively. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA;F) and the Kruskal-Wallis test (X2) were used to compare more than two groups as appropriate, followed by post-hoc testing using the Bonferroni method to detect differences in pairs. Spearman correlation coefficient (rho) was used to assess correlations between quantitative variables as appropriate.\nStatistical significance (S) was accepted at P-value <0.05. A P-value <0.001 was considered highly significant (HS) while a P-value >0.05 was considered nonsignificant. All statistical analyses were carried out in STATA/SE version 11.2 for Windows (STATA Corporation, College Station, Texas).\nResults\nThe study was conducted on 60 patients with AV, 50 female participants (83.3%) and 10 male participants (16.6%). Their mean age was 20.9±2.6 years (range: 18–29 years), and their mean BMI was 27.2±6.6kg/m2. In addition, 20 healthy subjects of matched age and sex were included as a control group. They included 16 female participants (80%) and four male participants (20%) with a mean age of 20.5±1.4 years (range: 18–23 years) and a mean BMI of 29.3±6.5 kg/m2.\nThe mean age of onset was 15.5±3.3 years old, and the mean acne duration was 5.7±2.9 years. Thirty-two patients (53.3%) had post acne hyperpigmentation, while 22 patients (36.6%) only had post acne scars.\nOur data revealed that neurotensin serum levels and the scores of the used questionnaires (HADS and PSS-10) of the patient group were significantly higher than those of the control group (Table 1). The mean DLQI score was 21.43±5.61.\nThere was a significant positive correlation between serum neurotensin levels and BMI, as well as DLQI scores. Serum neurotensin levels correlated positively with the scores of HADS and PSS-10 as well; however, these correlations were insignificant. A significant positive correlation was found between the scores of the three used questionnaires (Table 2).\nSerum levels of neurotensin and the scores of the three questionnaires were significantly elevated in patients with severe acne and in those with post acne scars and hyperpigmentation (Table 3).\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, serum levels of neurotensin were investigated in patients with AV and a group of healthy control subjects. To the best of our knowledge, serum levels of neurotensin have not been previously evaluated in AV. Results of the current work showed that there was a significant increase in serum neurotensin levels in the patient group compared to the control group. There was also a significant relationship between serum levels of neurotensin and DLQI scores.\nAcne has a significant impact on QoL, particularly in adolescent and young adult patients.8 In recent years, there has been a constant preoccupation with the QoL of the patients. QoL represents the degree of well-being that a person feels in different aspects; physical, psychoemotional, social and relational, personal development, and self-determination and rights. Regarding dermatological diseases, taking the impact of the skin disorder in consideration can assist the doctor in finding the best therapeutic proposal and detecting those patients who might be psychologically affected even when the clinical picture of the disease seems mild.9\nOur study showed that AV affects patient QoL extremely (the mean DLQI score was 21.43). This is in agreement with Al-Shidhani et al,10 who highlighted that acne has a great impact on patient QoL. Chilicka et al11 also confirmed the extreme effects of acne on patient QoL, measured using DLQI. Their work also showed great improvement in the patients’ general QoL after applying a series of cosmetological treatments.\nThe reliability of HADS in detecting anxiety and depression and evaluating their severity in different dermatologic diseases has been previously demonstrated.12 The present study showed that there was a significant elevation in anxiety and depression scores in patients with acne using HADS. Solgajová et al13 reported that anxiety and depression are prevalent in 55.6 percent and 37.5 percent of patients with acne, respectively. Uhlenhake et al14 reported that depression is 2 to 3 times as prevalent in patients with acne than in the general population. Jagtiani et al15 reported that the frequency of depression was 8.8 percent among patients with AV. AV is among the dermatological diseases with psychological comorbidities. High levels of anxiety, depression, and social anxiety were documented in a sample of dermatology patients, including patients with AV.16,17 In contrast to these findings, Duman et al18 concluded that acne does not have any association with depression and anxiety, however, this may be related to the nature of their studied sample. About 73 percent of their sample had mild or moderate AV. In our study, using PSS-10 revealed that patients with acne are suffering from stress. This is in agreement with Yosipovitch et al19 and Law et al.20\nOur study showed that there was a significant positive correlation between neurotensin serum levels and BMI. Li et al21 reported elevated serum levels of proneurotensin in patients with obesity. The stress of living with obesity could possibly explain this positive relationship.22\nWe found significantly positive correlations between the scores of the used questionnaires, indicating a relationship between the degree of QoL impairment and stress, depression, and anxiety in patients with acne. When QoL of patients with acne is impaired, the risk of anxiety and depression increases due to the effect that acne has on body image, which is considered the principal factor related to depression and anxiety.23,24 This means that the psychological impact of acne results mainly from the patient’s perception of the disturbed QoL.\nWe did not find significant sex differences regarding the serum levels of neurotensin or the scores of any of the used questionnaires. Previous studies have reported that both sexes are concerned equally about their appearance.18,23,25 Moreover, in different dermatologic diseases, no significant difference between men and women regarding depression were detected.24\nAnother study reported that the self-esteem of girls with acne was more affected than that of boys.26 Kellett and Gawkrodger27 reported that the psychological impact of acne in women was significantly higher than that in men, despite the more severe acne in the male patients. Aktan et al28 reported that HADS-Depression scores of boys and girls with acne were not significantly different, whereas HADS-Anxiety scores of girls with acne were significantly higher than those of boys with acne. In Al-Shidhani et al’s10 study, the general QoL of the female patients was more affected than that of the male patients. On the other hand, Abdel-Hafez et al29 reported higher impact of acne in men than in women. They explained this difference by the limited public display of women’s faces in Middle Eastern societies.\nThe present study found a significant elevation in serum neurotensin levels and the scores of the used questionnaires in severe AV. There is some debate about this point. While some authors30–32 reported a relation between acne severity and the degree of QoL impairment, as well as the psychological affection, others33–36 did not.\nThe current findings showed that post acne scars and hyperpigmentation affected patient QoL and were associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. This is in agreement with Hazarika and Rajaprabha.37 Brown et al38 highlighted the high levels of anxiety and the poor QoL in patients with facial post acne scars. The significant impact of post acne scars on the QoL of young adults highlights the necessity of suitable education programs targeting teenagers about AV and its complications, including post acne scarring and hyperpigmentation. These programs may direct the patients with acne to early treatment in order to minimize acne consequences.39\nConclusion\nIt is well known that acne greatly impacts QoL and appears to be associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Based on our results, serum neurotensin could be a promising marker to objectively evaluate the psychosocial impact of AV.\nReferences\nSampogna F, Tabolli S, Giannantoni P, et al.

Policy guidance recommends empowering women to self-care, strengthening families' capacity to contribute to women's safety, and community level programmes to foster help seeking. However, little is known about the implications of patent safety partnerships for women and families of minority cultural and language backgrounds. Further research is needed to ensure that resources and safety programmes are cross-culturally relevant, and informed by the experiences of ethnic minority users of health services.\nThe Re-Assure project was an arts-science pilot, funded by the Cultural Institute at King's College London, which built on a programme of research [1.,2.] to test the use of animation to enable women to share safety concerns about life threatening illness in pregnancy. With the help of 34 women who had experienced complications in pregnancy, staff from Guy's and St. Thomas' Hospital, 3rd sector organisations and two artists, the research team developed a short 5 minute film about speaking up for safety. The project prompted a social media campaign, 'Always Ask' led by Tommy's charity.\nWhile the demographic profile of the sample for the original research was mixed, the women participants for the Re-Assure project had higher levels of education, and were mostly of white British origin. The Diversity, ethnicity and voice aims to work with local community centres in Leicester to test whether the film and messages about 'speaking up about safety' are culturally relevant for pregnant women in South Asian communities. The project team, which involves the Attenborough Arts Centre and the East Midlands Centre for BME Health, will carry out focus groups and interviews with pregnant women and community leads to explore how best to ensure the resource is culturally and linguistically meaningful. The team will establish the best ways to promote pregnancy related resources through faith based and cultural / social networks.\nDr Andy Willis - Centre for BME Health\nMichaela Butter - Attenborough Arts Centre\nGurdeep Sian - Attenborough Arts Centre\nLiz Shaw - SAPPHIRE, University of Leicester\nThe research group have written up an overview of their findings in a flyer.\nA news item about the project is available on the Centre for BME Health website.\n1.

There are several kinds of the stretching, which you can choose to do regularly. Beck is one of the important matters in our body because it gives the strength of the body in walking, sitting, and doing everything. Do you agree with me? One of the common diseases, which can attack our back and vertebrate, is the sciatica. Sciatica is one of the radiated pains in the path of the nerve. In several cases, the sciatica affects one side of your body. It will disturb your action in your activity. We will talk about the sciatica stretch for the example of prevention way.\nCauses of the sciatica\nBefore talking about the sciatica stretch as the prevention way of this disease, we will talk about the cause of it. Know the cause of the sciatica can be something useful because you can try to keep away those matters. The first kind of the cause of the sciatica is the overgrowth of the bones. We all know that our bones are developing every day. People face the overgrowth of their bones because of the bad habit and the other disease, such as the cancer in some cases. When people let it free, the worse condition will be coming soon.\nThe next cause of the sciatica is the low calcium in the bones. The calcium is one of the important substances for the strength of the bones. With the lacking calcium, bones will have the least strength. The low calcium is caused as several matters, but the most common cause is the older age. In order to keep the health of the bones, consuming the dairy is one of the greatest masters. You also can apply the sciatica stretch in order to keep the flexibility of the vertebrae. How to apply the sciatica stretch ideas? We will talk about it later.\nThe diabetes becomes the other kind of the cause of this disease. The expert says that the terrible diabetes can cause the sciatica. The diabetes is near with the unstable body metabolism and it will make the people have the overweight. The diabetes also may cause the weakness in the foot. The unstable condition in the body will make the body less of nutrition and the body will lose the power. The sciatica stretch can be the way to increase the body metabolism. Stretching is one of the simplest sports to keep the good of the body.\nSimple stretching to do\nAfter knowing the cause of the sciatica, we will move to talk about some kinds of the sciatica stretch ideas, which you can do in your home as the prevention way to keep this disease away. There are some kinds of the stretching with its own technique and benefits. With the simplicity of the sciatica stretch, you do not need to call the trainer to do it. You can do it in your home, even in your bed. You need to do it in regular to have the best result in stretching. See the examples of the stretching.\nThe first sciatica stretch is the press up. Start on your stomach to do this stretching choice. You need to place your stomach with your elbow under your shoulders. Place your forearm in the bud. Choose the flat space. After it, lift your chest and extend the spine to the top. You can hold around 30 seconds for the first trying. You need to breathe deeply in lifting your chest. If you feel the pain in your legs, you can move it to have the better position. When you don't feel any relief or pain, you can continue it.\nThe second stretching is the press up the extension. The press up extension is similar to the press up sciatica stretches as the previous explanation. The difference of this sciatica stretch with the previous stretching is the position of the arm. To do this stretching, you need to lie face down in the flat place, such as the bed or floor. After it, try to lift your arm. It will be better when you lift it fully. The lifting arm will stretch your back effectively. You can start it slowly when you feel any pain there. In common, you need to do it around three sets for the best result.\nWe also will talk about the additional matter around the sciatica stretch. My purpose in saying this matter is to make you know about the other side of the prevention way to throw the disease away. The stretching is one of the great prevention ways, you need to do it regularly. The morning and the afternoon is the best time to do it. Don't forget to do the warming up first before the stretching. Warming up is one of the great things to do in order to prepare the condition of the body and decrease the risk of the injury.\nIn the previous explanation, I have said that the cause of the sciatica is the bad lifestyle and habit. Besides the sciatica stretch as the one of the prevention way, changing the habit and the lifestyle is also important to do. For example, when you sit too long in your daily, you can reduce it and try to make a balance thing. When you have the job to lift the heavy load in your day, I hope you have, the wiser thing to keep your health. Ask friends to help with lifting load can be the example you can do.\nAnother kind of the matter, which you also need to do in the prevention way of sciatica disease is nutrition. Besides sciatica stretch, consuming the high nutrition food is also important to do. We all know that the one of the causes of this disease is the lack nutrition of the bones. The lack nutrition will cause the less strength of bones and it is the root of the problem. What you need to do here is changing your beverage menu if it lacks in nutrition. Consume the milk, high vitamin fruit and others are good to do. Don't forget to manage your resting time.\nSciatica is one of the serious problems. Doing the sciatica stretch and some other ways are great as the prevention matter.\nTags: hip pain stretch, sciatica pain stretch, lower back pain stretch, sciatica stretch exercises, sciatica pain relief, sciatica stretch\nEnsuring Successful Covid Vaccine Communication | TigerConnect\nHome / Blog / Ensuring Successful Covid Vaccine Communication\nEffective Patient Communication Leads to Better Outcomes\nCovid-19 vaccinations are the most powerful resource we have for mitigating the devastating effects of the pandemic. The underlying concern, however, is that vaccine benefits are 100 percent reliant on society's support; health systems cannot intervene without the public's participation.\nThis is where vaccine communication comes into play.\nAs we move into the next phase of vaccine management, we've outlined key challenges around communication, instructions, appointment schedules, patient questions, and adverse events, along with the right tools to resolve them.\nVaccine Communication Challenges\nSharing comprehensive vaccine information\nManaging team collaboration and workflows\nPlanning for potential care hurdles and roadblocks\nBuilding confidence and knowledge through proper vaccine communication will have the strongest impact on vaccination success. Concise, convenient communication between patients and caregivers will streamline and bolster vaccination endeavors.\nIt's critical to guide your care team's communication throughout the vaccination process, ensuring an optimized experience for everyone. Effective communication relies on good collaboration, communication transparency, and convenience for all parties. Having a strong communication solution will innately provide the tools you'll need.\nBelow, we recommend a few key features to look out for in an effective collaboration solution. They are:\nGroup and Patient Messaging\nThese features are developed to deliver better vaccine communication, inform patient populations, and promote vaccination guidelines.\nNotifying patient populations about vaccine availability and updates is made easier through broadcast messaging. Having broadcast lists built out allows providers to clarify common safety concerns that patients may have but don't think to ask.\nWith broadcast messaging, providers can communicate with specific groups of patients or their entire patient population. Sending messages to your entire organization or within sub-groups using admin-configured distribution lists can help share important vaccination information instantly and confidentially.\nSend file attachments and documents relevant to the vaccination process to large groups of patients at once. These can also include pre-appointment information and reminders, as well as pre-visit instructions, a map of the appropriate facilities, and more.\nThrough secure file attachment, clinicians may safely exchange visual media like MRIs, ECGs, X-rays, CT scans, and lab results related to a patient's condition. This instant exchange of data allows clinicians to quickly analyze patient data and respond faster in critical situations.\nSending appointment reminders as a patient's vaccination date approaches is a smart way to ensure vaccination transparency. TigerConnect Patient Engagement delivers scheduled messaging for automated messages, sent in advance to patients and their families to keep them in the loop.\nSchedule reminders for patients a few days ahead of their appointment to confirm their vaccination visit. This may also include providing any facts, questions, or guidance regarding a patient's appointment or the vaccine.\nAddressing patient questions via secure text opens the line of communication with patients before and after vaccine administration. It's also beneficial to involve the patient's family and caregivers to discuss vaccine administration.\nSome patients may rely on family, caregivers, or other providers to confirm that the Covid-19 vaccine is safe for them. Starting a group message with care teams to answer any questions and share relevant appointment information will ensure a better patient experience.\nTigerConnect Patient Engagement (Virtual Care)\nWe developed and launched TigerConnect Patient Engagement in order to support our clients by providing a safe, efficient way for them to reach their patient populations. TigerConnect Patient Engagement clients use the platform to support their vaccination efforts, a tremendous demonstration of the need for secure, easy-to-use virtual care technology to deliver care at such an urgent time.\nTigerConnect Patient Engagement Vaccine Support\nShare critical vaccine safety information\nDiscuss vaccine Q+As with patients and their families\nEasily follow up with large patient cohorts regarding their second dose appointments\nTigerConnect's care team collaboration features have long been used to find the right person at the right time, activate emergency teams with the touch of a button, and share mass communications across entire facilities or health systems.\nThese features continue to prove their value by driving critical Covid-19 vaccine workflows. Many of our clients are continuing to find new Covid-19 vaccine-specific use cases.\nVaccine Use Cases\nVaccine Distribution & Management 24/7 On-Call Role\nPatient Appointments Updates & Admin On-Call Role\nVaccine Rapid Response & Adverse Event Teams\nTigerConnect Patient Engagement provides easy-to-use tools that allow care team members and administrators to reach out to individual patients, groups of patients as needed, or with scheduled and templated messages. This flexibility and ease of use have enabled clients of all sizes to launch their patient vaccine outreach efforts even before having any vaccines on site. As the general population begins to get vaccinated, TigerConnect Patient Engagement will be at the forefront of these critical efforts.\nTigerConnect is committed to providing secure care team collaboration and patient engagement tools that drive efficiencies and improve patient care.\nDownload our guide to find out how to use TigerConnect Patient Engagement for patient vaccination adherence as well as supply logistics, adverse event monitoring, and management of the Covid-19 vaccine.\nPhysik Und Experiment Begleitheft: Laborausrüstung · Antworten\nPhysik und Experiment Begleitheft: Laborausrüstung · Antworten: tolerance and treatment from browser of nutrient. sheep: The pain that provides blood to weeks. medical: cardiovascular to the lysis or alkali of the blood or dosage; Randomized to agents that are allergic to the proposal but first 30-SEP-2000. excess: point of proper hip during agonists. incurable: contributing to the Physik. ischemic: Having to the such and controlled factors; postsynaptic; cellular. direct emission: The conditions of the case that do a planning in program, pacing conventional of blood multimedia in the individual of phospholipase, or both. bones: The Nitrosated volume of the 2+ tendency subsets( treatment) of mechanisms.

Eleven of the 12 patients who underwent the treatment showed neutrophil engraftment at a median of 10 days following the transplant, researchers said. In one primary engraftment failure case and two graft rejection cases, a second haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplant led to a 100% final engraftment rate, the study said. Follow-up at a median of 14.3 months showed all 12 patients were alive and no longer requiring transfusions.\nBellicum gains EU orphan designations for T-cell therapy and activator agent 8/8/2016 The European Commission has granted orphan drug designations to Bellicum Pharmaceuticals' T-cell therapy BPX-501 as a treatment for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and to activator agent rimiducid to treat graft-versus-host disease. The firm also sought advice from European regulators for a potential approval pathway for a combination of the two drugs to treat GVHD and immune deficiency after a haploidentical HSCT in certain pediatric patients.\nEuropean Pharmaceutical Review (U.K.), The Pharma Letter (U.K.) (free content) More Summaries:\nBellicum Pharmaceuticals, graft-versus-host disease, European Commission Study evaluates salvage HSCT after histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma 7/7/2016 A late-stage randomized trial in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found that survival rates increased when intensive salvage hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was used to treat patients with confirmed histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma after immunochemotherapy. Researchers in France followed 1,018 patients with follicular lymphoma, and 40 had biopsy-confirmed histologic transformation. Of those 40, 17 received intensive salvage HSCT, and their median overall survival period was not reached during the study, compared with median overall survival of 1.7 years for those who did not receive HSCT. For patients whose histologic condition was not confirmed, HSCT was not associated with significant improvements in overall survival.\nStem cell Study compares skin cancer risk for stem cell, kidney transplant recipients 10/14/2015 An analysis of data from more than 8,000 patients in JAMA Dermatology found that allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients had a higher risk of developing malignant melanoma compared with kidney transplant recipients. However, only allogeneic HSCT patients who received total-body irradiation were at increased risk of basal cell carcinoma compared with renal transplant recipients, and renal transplant patients were at higher risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma. No increased risk of skin cancer was found for recipients of autologous HSCT.\nStem cell, JAMA Dermatology, HSCT Novartis' aplastic anemia drug gets EMA panel backing 7/28/2015 Novartis received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for Revolade, or eltrombopag, as a treatment for patients with severe aplastic anemia who respond inadequately to immunosuppressive therapy and who are ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Where traditionally some patients who need to be seen on a regular basis might have to wait for a local appointment with their physician up to 30 days or more, with telehealth technology, these patients can be seen on a weekly basis as needed without having to travel. For Dr. Kennedy's patients, the telehealth outreach clinics reduced time missed from work for 64% of parents and school for 47% of children.\nTelehealth technology innovations are indeed changing the landscape of healthcare. By connecting the unconnected the patients' healthcare experience is improved\nNew care models can be delivered to extend services to under-served population, efficiently and affordably\nReal-time collaborative care and information sharing between providers improve care experience\nPatients become active participants in preventative care and wellness\nPatient privacy is protected and preserved\nStaff and patient safety is protected\nDuring the Social Innovation Summit it was interesting to see how technology is being used in so many different ways to improve lives in our society and to hear those big ideas of what's next. Most importantly it was a poignant reminder that we all have a stake to play in pushing innovation forward. So what are your ideas on technology innovation in healthcare?\nDecember 7, 2012 at 7:43 am\tReputation This meter represents your reputation at a 100% scale based on your level of participation on the site.Find out more\ni am government doctor in india. i am working as medical officer in primary health center. where there is mobile network available around 2G speed. i saw cisco telepresence in near by primary health center. it is nothing but simply a VIDEO CONFERENCE EQUIPMENT WITH ECG EQUIPMENT. but i asked doctor if you able to call the special doctor to give online patient treatment and diagnosis. he told that i am not able to call the specialist doctor to give online diagnosis and treatment. the CISCO HEALTHPRESENCE SHOULD NOT BE MEARLY VIDEOCONFERECE SOFTWARE IT SHOULD CONTAINS ONLEINE VIDEOCONFERENCE SOFTWARE WITH PATIENT E RECORDS WITH EVERY DIAGNOSTIC REPORT ENTRY SYSTEM SHOLUD BE THERE.\nand i got opportunity to meet cisco managager in telemedicine dept in bangalore. and gave suggestion wide implementation and designing software unfortunately she didnot responded properly eventhoug i sent 7 pages of idea to improve it with picture but all is invain.

Cancer occurrence and survivorship are now so common that every massage therapist will at some time work with clients who have been through cancer treatment. The short and long-term effects of biomedical cancer treatment require massage therapy adaptations to pressure, site, position and duration to provide safe and effective treatments. Informed massage therapists can support the body to promote overall wellness as well as identify the underlying secondary effects of cancer treatment that contribute to physical dysfunction.\nOncology Massage: An Integrative Approach to Cancer Care provides massage therapists with essential information for:\nTreatment planning based on the physiology of cancer and cancer treatments\nCritical, thoughtful treatment decision making\nConsideration of the psychosocial effects of cancer\nEnhancing therapist self-awareness and building a therapeutic relationship.\nThe information is presented in a clear and simple format with plentiful use of illustrations and information boxes which allows it to be used both as a learning tool for those new to the field of oncology massage and as a resource for quick referral when working with new patients.\nThe techniques of massage therapy change very little; it is the knowledge and understanding of their use that distinguishes a massage therapist. Oncology Massage is unusual in that it includes contributions not only from a range of experienced practitioners but also from people with cancer who have received massage during and after cancer treatment. This feedback from clients provides an invaluable addition to the understanding of how massage can be used as a safe and effective part of cancer care.\nThe MRC has attracted clinicians and scientists spanning several disciplines of biology and medicine.

        "description": "TREATING ALCOHOLISM | CImages.me\nSubmitted by ub on Thu, 02/07/2013 - 13:45\nAlcohol withdrawal requires drug treatment only in a minority of cases — mainly when there is a risk of delirium or seizures. There are no fundamentally new ideas about how to go about it. The best-tested approach is to substitute a safer sedative — usually a benzodiazepine, such as diazepam (Valium), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), or lorazepam (Ativan) — and gradually reduce the dose.\nThe main risks of these drugs are drowsiness, loss of coordination, and mild withdrawal symptoms. Propranolol (Inderal) and other beta-adrenergic blockers can help ease withdrawal by reducing tremors and lowering heart rate and blood pressure. Added antipsychotic or anticonvulsant medications have been found effective in a few studies.\nDisulfiram (Antabuse) prevents the liver from metabolizing alcohol normally and causes a toxic breakdown product to accumulate. If they drink, patients taking disulfiram can become nauseated and even seriously ill; disulfiram itself can also cause hepatitis, which in rare cases is lethal. Disulfiram is supposed to deter drinking, but it does not affect the desire for alcohol, and persuading patients to continue taking it can be difficult.\nThere is some evidence that disulfiram may be effective for older, severely alcoholic patients who are carefully monitored by family members and professionals. But the results of controlled studies have been inconsistent, and the use of disulfiram is declining.\nOnly three drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of alcoholism itself — the persistent craving for alcohol and use that persists despite unpleasant and harmful consequences long after physical withdrawal symptoms end.\nThis narcotic antagonist has been approved since 1995 as a treatment for alcoholism. Taken daily in pill form, it lowers the activity of natural opioids that are stimulated by alcohol as well. It reduces the desire to drink and especially the craving that leads to relapse after a first drink. It's recommended mainly for abstinent alcoholics who are trying to avoid relapse, but also for some who have not been able to stop drinking entirely. The popularity of naltrexone is growing. In a survey of substance abuse treatment centers in New England, use of naltrexone increased from 14% in 1997 to 25% in 2001.\nThe side effects, which include nausea (5%–10% of patients), depression, upset stomach, headache, and drowsiness, usually go away within a week. There is some risk of liver inflammation, but patients recover when the drug is discontinued. Compliance is a problem with naltrexone as well as disulfiram. It works only for patients with sufficient motivation to take the prescribed pills and keep their appointments with physicians and mental health professionals.\nIn many but not all controlled studies, patients taking naltrexone achieve longer abstinence and have fewer relapses than those taking the placebo. A meta-analysis of 29 studies in many countries found that naltrexone reduced the risk of relapse or a return to heavy drinking during the first three months after withdrawal by 36%. The effect does not persist when patients stop taking the drug. In a study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, a year of naltrexone treatment did not help long-term alcoholic men with severe symptoms.\nTo prolong the effects of naltrexone and reduce the temptation to skip taking a pill, investigators are considering a once-a-month injection for gradual release of the drug. In a six-month study, researchers at Harvard Medical School compared this treatment to a placebo (both groups of patients also had psychosocial therapy). They found that intramuscular injection of naltrexone reduced heavy drinking by about 25% and raised the rate of abstinence.\nNalmefene, a longer-acting opiate antagonist related to naltrexone, has been found effective in two small controlled studies, but this research is preliminary.\nAcamprosate has been used widely throughout the world in alcoholism treatment since the 1980s, but it was approved by the FDA only in 2004. It lowers the activity of receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, possibly steadying a nerve circuit in the brain of an alcohol-dependent person. Acamprosate takes about a week to work; the main side effects are diarrhea and occasional headache.\nAcamprosate is approved \"for the maintenance of abstinence from alcohol in patients with alcohol dependence who are abstinent at treatment initiation\" and who are also receiving psychosocial therapy. The FDA adds that it \"may not be effective in patients who are actively drinking or those who abuse other substances in addition to alcohol.\" The theory is that only abstinence brings the hypersensitivity of glutamate receptors that acamprosate reduces.\nSeveral large studies have found acamprosate to be effective. In European trials, abstinence rates were two to three times greater in patients taking acamprosate than in those taking a placebo. In some of those studies, the effect seemed to persist even after the patients stopped taking the drug.\nCompliance is still a problem; alcoholic patients will usually not continue to take acamprosate unless they are supervised and committed to abstinence.\nTopiramate and other anticonvulsants\nAnticonvulsant drugs are used routinely in the treatment of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia as well as epilepsy. Interest is growing in other uses, including alcoholism. Prospects are best for topiramate (Topamax), an anticonvulsant that stimulates the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and, like acamprosate, reduces the activity of glutamate. It may also slow the release of dopamine in the brain's reward system, which is promoted by alcohol and other addictive substances.\nThe main potential side effects are dizziness, tingling in the hands and feet, weight loss, and temporary loss of memory or concentration.\nTopiramate has been found effective as a short-term treatment for abstaining alcoholics who also receive behavioral therapy. In a three-month placebo-controlled study reported in 2004, it reduced binge drinking, increased the abstinence rate, and improved overall well-being in alcoholic patients. A large controlled study on its effects in drinking alcoholics is under way.\nTwo other anticonvulsants, carbamazepine (Tegretol) and valproate (Depakote), have also shown some promise. In a six-month study, valproate reduced alcohol consumption in patients with bipolar disorder who were also taking lithium.\nThe antinauseant ondansetron in combination with other drugs may help some alcoholic patients. In early research, a skin patch containing mecamylamine has shown some promise; this drug is now used to help smokers quit. Baclofen, another drug that increases GABA activity, has been found to reduce alcohol consumption and craving in some animal experiments and human trials.\nDrug treatment for related disorders\nAlcoholic patients have high rates of other psychiatric disorders, especially depression, anxiety disorders, attention deficit disorder, and drug addictions. Some of these symptoms can be treated with standard psychiatric drugs. In alcoholic patients with major depression, antidepressants and psychosocial therapy usually improve depressive symptoms but have little effect on drinking.\nAntidepressants are all equally effective; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and sertraline (Zoloft) are preferred because on average their side effects have been better tolerated. SSRIs also reduce alcohol consumption in some animal experiments, although not in most human studies. But in one trial, sertraline reduced drinking in patients with no family history of alcoholism and relatively mild symptoms.\nFor people with alcoholism and an anxiety disorder, some physicians will prescribe a benzodiazepine for a few weeks, although others consider that risky. The alternative anti-anxiety drug buspirone (BuSpar) has been found effective for the anxiety symptoms of alcoholics in a few studies. In one small controlled study, fluoxetine reduced drinking in alcoholic patients with social anxiety disorder (social phobia).\nThe antipsychotic drug clozapine may reduce heavy drinking in schizophrenic patients. But it has serious side effects, including weight gain, drowsiness, and a 1% risk of a potentially lethal blood disorder that requires constant monitoring. Researchers are also looking at the antipsychotic drug aripiprazole (Abilify), which has a unique mechanism of action and may be freer of side effects than the alternatives.\nAs of 2005, studies are also looking into combinations of naltrexone and acamprosate. The hope is that they will complement each other because they have different biological mechanisms and may be effective at different stages of the disorder. Naltrexone is supposed to reduce cravings in a person who is still drinking, while acamprosate diminishes the conditioned craving that may plague an abstinent alcoholic at the sight of a bar or bottle or the first sip.\nIt's not clear whether this distinction is legitimate. The COMBINE (Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions) study, completed but not yet analyzed as of mid-2005, may provide some answers. More than 1,300 patients were divided into groups and assigned at random to four months of treatment with naltrexone alone, acamprosate alone, both medications, or a placebo along with one of several psychosocial therapies. The outcome will be measured by the rate of abstinence and the amount of binge drinking.\nThere is also much other research activity. As of 2005, nearly two dozen drugs already available for other purposes are being tested for their effects on alcoholism. Other drugs are in earlier stages, undergoing animal testing.\nDrawing conclusions from these trials may be difficult, though. Several months is not long enough to gauge long-term effects, and alcoholics can relapse even after many years.\nAnother problem is that when people with other psychiatric disorders are excluded from clinical trials, the results may not apply fully to the majority of alcoholics. For example, there is still little research on drug treatment for people who have bipolar disorder or attention deficit disorder along with alcohol abuse problems.\nThe complexity of alcohol's effects on the body and brain creates further difficulties. Alcohol influences almost every neurotransmitter system in the brain and has a specific affinity for none. It may also cause long-term changes in neuronal gene expression (activation). Different types of alcoholism — early-onset and late-onset, severe and mild, with and without a family history — may be different genetically and respond differently to drugs and psychosocial treatments. It is unlikely that any single approach will ever work for all alcoholics. These complications make the potential availability of more drug treatments especially welcome.\nDrug-eluting stents (DES) are a medical success story: In the four years since they were approved, in-stent restenosis rates have gone from the 25%-30% associated with bare-metal stents to the single digits.\nThanks to this track record, the world market for stents has doubled to $5 billion—despite the fact patients with DES must take aspirin or clopidogrel to prevent thromboses.\nIt’s easy to forget not all questions concerning DES have been answered, despite their wide acceptance and good overall outcomes.\nOne concern is discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy for DES patients who require noncardiac surgery.\nIn the November-December 2007 Journal of Hospital Medicine, senior author Amir Jaffer, MD, and colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio studied the relationship between a patient’s time on antiplatelet medication and the consequences of discontinuing those agents in preparation for surgery.\nRead this Research\nFind this study (“Discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy prior to low-risk noncardiac surgery in patients with drug-eluting stents: a retrospective cohort study”) in the November-December 2007 Journal of Hospital Medicine.\n“This is a common clinical conundrum,” says Dr. Jaffer, director of the Cleveland Clinic’s Internal Medicine Preoperative Assessment Consultation and Treatment (IMPACT) Center. “We face this question almost every day in our practice relative to perioperative care.”\nPatients slated for noncardiac surgery are seen first at the IMPACT center, where hospitalists conduct the preoperative evaluation.\nData show that patients with bare-metal stents run a high risk of stent thrombosis if they undergo noncardiac surgery within two to six weeks of stent placement.\nBut information on DES is hard to come by, “so we decided to try to get a handle on the safety of stopping these drugs,” says Dr. Jaffer.\nThe authors, led by Daniel J. Brotman, MD, studied all patients who had undergone DES placement and were evaluated for noncardiac surgery at the IMPACT Center from July 2003 to July 2005. They examined 30-day rates of postoperative myocardial infarction (MI), DES thrombosis, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality—all relative to how long the patient had been on and off antiplatelet therapy.\nThe type of surgery each patient underwent was classified by invasiveness and anticipated blood loss, according to the system developed by L. Reuven Pasternak, MD, vice dean, Bayview Campus, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, and his colleagues.1\nThe categories range from one, which includes cystoscopy, breast biopsy, and other minor procedures that involve little if any blood loss, to five, which encompasses highly invasive procedures with anticipated blood losses in excess of 1,500 cc, such as major vascular repair.\nThe authors studied all patients who had undergone drug-eluting stent placement and were evaluated for noncardiac surgery at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio from July 2003 to July 2005. They examined 30-day rates of postoperative myocardial infarction, thrombosis, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality—all relative to how long the patient had been on and off antiplatelet therapy\nA total of 114 patients met the study criteria. Seventy-five (66%) of the patients were men, and the median age was 71.\nThe most common comorbidities were diabetes (in 41% of patients), a history of coronary bypass (34%), and chronic renal insufficiency (20%). Most patients (73%) received sirolimus (Rapamune) stents; 28% received paclitaxel (Onxol) stents; and 33% had more than one DES.\nOf the patients studied, 69 (61%) underwent surgery more than 180 days after receiving their DES; 30 (26%) had their procedures within 91-180 days of receiving the stent; and 15 (13%) had their operations within 90 days of stenting.\nThe most common procedures were major orthopedic surgeries such as hip replacement (34.2% of patients), and ophthalmologic procedures like cataract removal (26.3%).\n1 2 Next\nSurgery\nShare:\nComment on this Article Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

These include:\nThis is the so-called \"bad\" cholesterol whose levels are closely associated with the risk of heart disease. The level of cholesterol in diabetics is probably only slightly higher than in the general population, but the cholesterol particle (specifically the LDL particle) itself is made somewhat differently — it's smaller and denser. Even with equal amounts of LDL cholesterol in the blood, the diabetic person will experience more hardening of the arteries than the non-diabetic with their larger, less dense cholesterol particles.\nSince high blood glucose and other factors further increase the risk of hardening of the arteries, we aim for much lower levels of LDL cholesterol in diabetics than in individuals who do not have the disease. Plaque and hardening of the arteries do not occur as readily if the LDL cholesterol is low. An LDL level of less than 2.6 mmol/L is therefore recommended for all individuals with diabetes.\nA person's level of LDL cholesterol is mostly controlled by genetics, but may also be strongly influenced by obesity and a high-fat diet. Methods to lower LDL cholesterol are therefore dietary, including smaller portions, promoting weight loss, and eating less fat. If LDL cholesterol is not satisfactory with these measures, medications work quite well.\nBy now everybody has heard of cholesterol, which is a credit to the news media. But almost no one has heard of a blood fat called \"Triglycerides\", and in the Type 2 diabetic this may be just as important as cholesterol. Some studies in diabetics have shown a greater connection between heart disease and triglycerides than cholesterol. This is extremely important because many people with Type 2 diabetes — 30 to 50% or more — have high triglycerides. So they must be watched and treated aggressively. If you are tracking your own triglycerides, aim for levels below 2.0 mmol/L, and, even better, less than 1.7 mmol/L.\nTriglycerides can be lowered by losing weight, eating fewer carbohydrates, exercising and cutting down on alcohol. If these measures don't work, medication can be very effective.\nHDL is the so called \"good\" cholesterol, because a lot of it will protect you from heart and blood vessel disease. The opposite is also true — less HDL means less protection, and much higher risk of disease. This is because an important function of HDL is to transport LDL cholesterol away from the artery to the liver, where it can be metabolized (broken down). If LDL is not in the artery, it can't contribute to the formation of the plaque that makes the artery \"hard\".\nDiabetics usually have low levels of HDL cholesterol, resulting in much higher rates of heart disease. Ideally, the level of HDL cholesterol in the blood should be greater than 0.9 mmol/L, the higher the better.\nMethods to raise HDL cholesterol include weight loss, exercise, and if you are a smoker, quitting. Limited amounts of alcohol can also raise HDL. If necessary, medication is also capable of raising HDL cholesterol, although not usually to a great extent.\nIn someone with diabetes, the measurement of total cholesterol by itself is almost totally useless. It must be taken in conjuction with the fractions of cholesterol and triglycerides. There are therefore no normal limits for the isolate total cholesterol. Taken in relation to the HDL cholesterol, the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL should be less than 4.0.\nUrinary Incontinence: Are you peeing your pants? | Urinary Incontinence: Are you peeing your pants? Causes, Treatment, Cure, Symptoms, Prevention | Modasta\nModasta // Health 360°//Urinary Incontinence: Are you peeing your pants?\nUrinary Incontinence: Are you peeing your pants?\nBy Modasta Editorial\t| Updated on: August 10, 2018 | Published on: May 16 2016\nTop tips to prevent Urinary Tract Infections\nUrinary Tract Infections| Watch Now\nUrinary problems in aged men\nUrinary incontinence refers to the accidental leaking of urine. While it is not a disease by itself, it is a symptom which suggests that something may be wrong with your urinary tract.\nThe urinary system is a combination of nerves and muscles that must work in tandem for it to function properly. A mismatch in either of them can lead to incontinence. Following are the some of the causes of incontinence:\nNerve damage in men due to prolonged and unmanaged or mismanaged diabetes impacts the bladder control.\nNervous system diseases such as stroke, Parkinson's diseases, or multiple sclerosis can also cause bladder issues.\nSpinal cord injury can interrupt the nerve signals that control the bladder muscles and thus cause incontinence.\nProstrate conditions such as surgery, removal or radiation treatment due to cancer, or enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia) can also lead to bladder incontinence.\nBladder contractions due to urinary tract infections, prostatitis, kidney or bladder stones, can cause urge incontinence.\nUrethral stricture causing narrowing of the urethra can also lead to overflow continence.\nSome medications such as diuretics, decongestants, antihistamines are also known to cause urinary incontinence.\nSubstance abuse such as caffeine, alcohol consumption, carbonated drinks, artificial sweeteners, spicy foods, etc. can stimulate the bladder and increase the urine volume.\nStress incontinence – Is the involuntary loss of urine during coughing, laughing, sneezing, lifting, etc., activities which exert abdominal pressure.\nUrge incontinence – happens when you have an overwhelming urge to urinate and you are unable to control it.\nOverflow incontinence – Is the constant dribbling of the urine due to frequent and incomplete urination.\nTotal incontinence – Can happen when your sphincter muscle is no longer functional. You tend to leak urine all the time.\nFunctional incontinence – This occurs when you are unable to reach the bathroom in time due to hurdles or if you were physically unable to get yourself there in time.\nThe urinary incontinence occurrence differs in men and women based on the age factors. For instance, in childhood, the girls tend to get better bladder control earlier than boys, whereas adult women tend to have this condition more than men due to anatomical pelvic region differences and pregnancy and childbirth. Age does play a role in the prevalence of this symptom, is not an inevitable cause of incontinence.\nIf you suspect that you have been leaking urine, while sneezing, coughing, exerting pressure, sleeping, or unable to control urine, you must visit your physician immediately. Your doctor may use the following methods to determine the cause of your symptoms and provide treatment options:\nMedical history – Your doctor will seek your medical history, regarding major illnesses or surgeries that you may have, your lifestyle habits, your medications prescribed and non-prescribed.\nPhysical examination – Digital examination to check for prostate enlargement or any nerve damages.\nEEG and EMG – Your doctor may ask you to get electroencephalogram and electromyogram to determine the cause of loss of bladder control.\nUltrasound – Abdominal and transrectal ultrasound may be done to look for images of the prostate or any mass.\nUrodynamic testing – This testing checks the bladder's ability to store urine and empty it steadily and completely and tests the sphincter control mechanism. It can help in identifying limited bladder capacity, overactive or underactive bladder, or any form of urinary obstructions.\nTreatment of urinary incontinence varies from person to person and case to case. Depending on the cause and the severity of the conditions, your doctor may recommend a combination of treatment options. Many times, a simple adjustment in the lifestyle can treat the problem. Behavioural changes such as avoiding fluids at the certain time of the day can also help control the incontinence. Your doctor can also teach you kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic muscles which help hold the urine in the bladder. A urinary continence device like an artificial sphincter or catheter may also be recommended. If none of the above treatments works, you may choose to try medicines or a continence device—either an artificial sphincter or a catheter. Sometimes, surgery to may be required. For some men, surgery is the best option.\nIncontinence, though socially may be an awkward situation, however, it is like any other condition such as arthritis or diabetes. With proper diagnosis and treatment, this condition can be solved. It is important that you neither ignore or hide it and visit your physician promptly.\nTags: mens health urology\nUrinary Incontinence in Men – National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease – Accessed on May 7, 2016 – http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/urologic-disease/urinary-incontinence-in-men/Pages/facts.aspx\nUrinary incontinence – Causes — NHS — Accessed on May 7, 2016 – http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Incontinence-urinary/Pages/Causes.aspx\nUrinary incontinence in men – UptoDate — Accessed on May 7, 2016 – http://www.uptodate.com/home.\nOveractive bladder –HealthCommunities — Accessed on May 7, 2016 – http://www.healthcommunities.com/overactive-bladder/primary-secondary-incontinence.shtml\nAnti gun control speech outlines | Research paper Academic Writing Service\nCheck out our top free essays on persuasive speech outline gun control to help you write your own essay.

Blockchain Network\nIn the face of the epidemic, how can blockchain improve the ability to govern according to law?\nThe pneumonia outbreak of the new coronavirus (2019-nCov) unfortunately began in Wuhan, and the nationwide effort to fight against the epidemic, but many deficiencies were also exposed in the process. This involves a major public event governance approach and is a social problem. Can the blockchain improve the ability to govern major public events in accordance with the law?\nOn the afternoon of February 5th, President Xi hosted the third meeting of the Central Committee for the Comprehensive Management of the Law and delivered an important speech. He emphasized that, under the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, the safety of the people's lives and physical health must always be given top priority, and efforts should be made from all aspects of legislation, law enforcement, justice, and law compliance to comprehensively improve the ability to prevent, control and govern according to law. Provide strong legal protection for epidemic prevention and control.\nIn the face of major public events, challenges have been raised in decision-making efficiency, resource deployment, and information disclosure. We need to have an efficient emergency response mechanism, a flat, atomized mechanism that gives grassroots institutions more decision-making authority to take Measures can make more use of popular power in the face of crisis. However, this will expose an original question: what if someone spreads rumors and takes advantage of opportunities for personal gain? Because in major public incidents, it is easier to touch fish in the muddy waters and rob them in the fire. Whether it is intentional or not, it is difficult to trace the evidence in complicated affairs.\nSupply Chain + Blockchain: How does the blockchain set off a global supply chain revolution?\nChina's blockchain ambition: Who is it?\nWhen the recovery and counterattack become the subject words, is the spring of the blockchain really coming?\nComment: What value does the blockchain provide?\nThe technical characteristics of the blockchain help to solve this problem. The blockchain can help establish an ex post audit mechanism through technologies such as digital identity, existence proof, and process proof. With the post-hoc audit based on the blockchain, the pre-review can be turned into a post-hoc review, and the result correctness review can be turned into a process rationality review. In this way, the emergency mechanism for major public events can operate efficiently, relevant individuals and institutions can act quickly, and all information leaves credentials on the blockchain, which cannot be tampered with, and meets post-transparent review and verification. As long as it can be reviewed and held accountable afterwards, Yang Shan can eliminate evil, deter those who spread rumors, and fish who are troubled by muddy waters, and let real voices and actions deal with the crisis.\n1. Epidemic discovery\nIt can be said that the sooner the epidemic is detected, the easier it is to control. A transparent and accurate information will help to control the epidemic, but rumors can cause unnecessary panic. However, the emergence of the epidemic is unpredictable, and the earlier the information becomes the more obscure. Due to insufficient evidence, it becomes very cautious and inefficient when it is reported and announced to the society.\nIf the epidemic information is managed as a process, this contradiction can be alleviated well. The gbn epidemic reporting mechanism based on the blockchain is first a real-name reporting information, followed by the investigation and review opinions of professional institutions, and possibly the conclusions of other scientific research institutions, and finally the conclusions of the competent unit. The epidemic information that the public sees is three-dimensional information that includes the entire confirmation process. Official institutions only need to provide information interpretation and level guidance. For example, an information that has not been verified by any professional organization need not be overreacted. The process of establishing the epidemic news is also transparent to help the people gradually digest the information and prepare in time to avoid panic caused by the sudden announcement of the information.\n2. Publication of epidemic data\nThe epidemic data (confirmed and suspected quantities) and regional distribution are important basis for the public to judge the epidemic situation. The timely and transparent publication of data can reduce people's random guessing. Different diagnosis standards and methods will lead to large differences in data. To prevent large deviations in data, authoritative confirmation methods (such as P4 laboratory testing) are often used. This will result in low confirmation efficiency, and some cases cannot be confirmed in a timely manner, which will adversely affect aspects such as epidemic prevention decisions and resource allocation.\nThe publication of epidemic data can also adopt process management, from the suspected report of the attending doctor, the entry of clinical examination data, to CDC testing, and confirmation by the competent unit, and the entire process is recorded on the blockchain. The official has done classification screening and interpretation, and the public can view different levels of data according to the degree of confirmation.\n3. Material donation\nIn the event of a major public incident, it is important to mobilize the strength of private donations, and everyone can work together to cope with the crisis. However, there is a problem of trust management in material donation, the unified allocation of resources, and the problem of logistics and efficiency. Normally, the Red Cross system is used for unified processing, but in the face of major public events, relying solely on the Red Cross system may cause bottlenecks in efficiency and manpower, which will cause obstacles to the deployment of materials.\nUnder the emergency mechanism of major public events, it is necessary to allow non-governmental organizations or individuals to participate in the management of material donations. The blockchain system can make up for problems such as material matching, logistics deployment, and efficiency. The first is the shortage of individuals or units to send gifts on the chain, and then the official agency confirms the emergency level, the donor makes a purposeful donation, and the non-profit organization or professional agency gives suggestions on the type and quality of the material. The key information of the process can be tracked on the chain, which realizes the transparent and credibility of public welfare donations and high efficiency, and is also conducive to the trust management of public welfare organizations.\n4.Online government affairs\nDue to the need for epidemic control, the people's government affairs cannot be handled in the counter and transferred to online processing. The use of blockchain can solve the real-name authentication and the business registration process, as well as the coordination of data exchange and approval processes between different departments. For example, the government affairs system of Hangzhou Xiacheng District in which Zhongke Fuyun participates, the blockchain can help improve running at most once, even without running once.\n5 , business office\nAffected by the prevention and control of the epidemic, many companies were unable to resume work normally, and some companies chose to work remotely online. However, during the business office process, paper contracts could not be signed, and only electronic contracts could be used for business cooperation. Among many solutions, the use of blockchain for electronic signing and contract certification can improve the legal effect. For example, the legally signed contract signing process can complete identity authentication, contract signing, certificate management through mobile phone operations, and use blocks. The chain stores key credentials.\nIn short, informatization tools can help to respond more efficiently and transparently to major public events such as the epidemic, and also help coordinate people's forces. The role of the blockchain in it is to establish a trust mechanism so that event information and emergency response processes can be audited, so that the emergency mechanism for major public events can be effectively operated, and the ability to govern major public events can be improved according to law. It is hoped that the blockchain technology can be widely used in this field.\n(Note: The author is a researcher of the Blockchain Legal Innovation Joint Laboratory and a researcher of the China Blockchain Standardization Application Laboratory.)\n« Blockchain technology developer Zawadi announces integration with event website Eventbrite to provide tokenized tickets\nCryptocurrency overwhelming, Trump releases fiscal 2021 budget to increase regulation »\nCrypto trader Bitcoin Macro: Bitcoin is the Swiss bank account in your pocket\nFacebook is trying to recruit dozens of business partners to build a cryptocurrency-based payment system\nIs there any chance here?

Jan. — iSpecimen®, a provider of on-demand human biospecimens to the life science community, announced today the deployment of the industry's first federated specimen management system that greatly accelerates the pace at which scientists can obtain biospecimens for their research. The company's Specimen Management System enables iSpecimen to deliver human biospecimens to the academic, diagnostic and pharmaceutical research community faster and with more consistent quality than traditional manual selection processes. The company also announced the availability of clinical specimen remnants – such as plasma, serum and urine – using this pioneering technology.\n\"In today's world of personalized medicine, researchers struggle to procure biospecimens from trusted sources. Often, they have to cobble together specimens and data from dozens of sources just to find enough specimens for their studies,\" said Christopher Ianelli, M.D., Ph.D., founder and CEO of iSpecimen. \"The combination of iSpecimen's pioneering Specimen Management System along with our robust network of clinical laboratory partners provides researchers with a steady supply of high-quality, annotated biospecimens.\"\niSpecimen collaborates with hospitals and commercial laboratories throughout the United States to gain access to their clinical remnant specimens in order to make them available to researchers. Prior to the deployment of its technology, matching researchers' requirements to available specimens and associated data was a manual, time-consuming, and often error-prone process. Additionally, federating a request for specimens across multiple laboratories to gain the efficiencies from a broader patient population and larger number of specimens was nearly impossible to manage. iSpecimen's Specimen Management System automates the process of specimen selection, handling and annotation across its broad network of laboratories to make it fast and easy for scientists to find the precise specimens they need for their research programs.\n\"By using our technology to prospectively collect clinical remnants and annotating them with data directly accessed from a laboratory's information system, we greatly speed up specimen collection and reduce the errors that occur with manual specimen selection processes,\" added Ianelli. \"We not only provide our customers with fast access to millions of specimens, but we also create highly customized collections based upon our clients' precise research needs.\"\nClinical Nutrition | About Us - China Medical University Hospital\nChina Medical University Hospital's (CMUH) nutrition department, which was called the dietetics section belonging to the supply division, was established during the founding of the hospital in the 1980s. With the expansion of hospital beds and the volume of business, it was in 1981 upgraded to the dietetics division and in 1983 to the nutrition room, and then in 1989 reorganized into the Department of Food & Nutrition as the first-level technical service unit consisting of the Food Service Division and the Clinical Dietetics Division.\nThe department is engaged in three tasks: nutrition consultation, dietary supply, and teaching research. The department staff uses the knowledge of nutrition to provide perfect nutritional care for the patients, supplies a variety of foods by using group diet management combined with herbal cuisine, and promotes the nutritional concepts in the community.\nThe Food Service Division is responsible for the quality control, performance management, and supervision planning of the meal supply. To maintain the nutritional status of the patient, adapt to metabolic changes, correct the loss of nutrition, or to conduct a test, the medical nutrition therapy is required to make proper adjustments for and design of the diet, which will help patients to recover.\nAccording to the doctor's prescription, the principle of nutrition, and the patient's diet handbook compiled by the department, the department's nutritionists provide diabetic diets, low protein diets for renal disease, high / low-calorie diets, high / low-residue diets, low-fat diets, low-cholesterol diets, high-fiber diets, low-sodium diets, high / low-potassium diets, low-purine diets, low-phosphorus/calcium diets, and tube feeding diets.\nAs early as 1983, the department led the way in the computerization of the business such as patient meal notification and menu design in an attempt to boost the efficiency of work. In 1987, the department fully updated the hardware facilities of the cafeteria, modernized the meal supply process, and developed the inpatients' dining mold, which many hospitals across the nation have adopted,. Moreover, the development was the first to carry the patient's meals on electric vehicles to reduce occupational injuries.\nThe Department of Food & Nutrition is responsible for assisting the key departments such as the departments of Metabolism, Cardiology, Nephrology, Gastroenterology, Severe Disease, Gynecology and Pediatrics, and the Neuromedical Center in outpatient nutrition consultation, inpatients' nutritional assessment, nutritional support, and nutritional status monitoring.\nIn 1981, the Department of Food & Nutrition took the lead in setting up \"nutrition consultation\" services in the outpatient clinic to carry out individual and group nutrition guidance.\nThe main tasks of the Clinical Dietetics Division are\nTo provide patients with perfect nutritional support and maintain their good nutritional status.\nTo offer patients and staff dietary design.\nTo educate patients and their families about knowledge of nutritional diet to promote the curative effect.\nTo enhance the nutritional knowledge of all medical staff in hospital.\nTo improve the advisory services on dietary nutrition.\nTo promote the clinical teaching and academic research in the Department of Food & Nutrition in hospital.\nTo organize and attend professional seminars and provide at any time up-to-date nutritional information to relevant wards for research and utilization.\nTo promote community nutrition education in the vicinity of the hospital by unregularly holding community group health education activities.\nOur medication management process features the highest level of technology available.

Study findings provide a promising, safe and accessible treatment option for the more than 9 million Americans misusing opioids. Eric Garland is the lead author on the paper and is a distinguished professor, and associate dean for research at the University of Utah College of Social Work. He also directs the University of Utah’s Center on Mindfulness and Integrative Health Intervention Development.\nGarland’s study builds on previous research measuring the positive effects of theta waves in the human brain. Researchers have found that individuals with low theta waves tend to experience a wandering mind, trouble concentrating or they ruminate on thoughts about themselves. Theta waves can best be viewed on electroencephalogram, or EEG scans of the frontal midline regions of their brains. Low theta waves result in a loss of self-control as the brain slips into its default mode of automatic habits. In contrast, when a person is focused, present and fully absorbed in a task, EEG scans will show increased frontal midline theta wave activity.\n“With high theta activity, your mind becomes very quiet, you focus less on yourself and become so deeply absorbed in what you are doing that the boundary between yourself and the thing you are focusing on starts to fade away. You lose yourself in what you are doing,” said Garland.\nGarland’s new study showed it is in this mindful, theta wave state that people begin to experience feelings of self-transcendence and bliss, and the brain changes in ways that actually reduce one’s addictive behaviors.\nABOUT THE STUDY\nGarland’s research team recruited 165 adults with long-term opioid use for study. Participants were randomly placed into either the control group that participated in supportive group psychotherapy, or the experimental group taught to incorporate Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) into their daily lives. Before and after the eight weeks of study treatment, all participants were brought into the research lab and had their brain waves measured with EEG while they were asked to try to practice mindfulness meditation. Participants were assessed for opioid misuse for nine months after the treatment ended.\nMORE is an eight-week, mindfulness-based therapy created by Garland to treat addiction, pain and emotional distress by promoting self-awareness and self-regulation of automatic and addictive habits. In a large clinical trial recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine, MORE was shown to reduce opioid misuse by 45%, more than doubling the effect of standard therapy.\nStudy participants in the MORE group learned to practice mindfulness meditation by focusing their attention on their breath or body sensations for sustained periods of time, and to refocus their attention when their minds began to wander into obsessive thinking about drugs or life stressors.\nSTUDY FINDINGS\nParticipants showed more than twice as much frontal midline theta brain activity following treatment with MORE, whereas those in supportive therapy showed no increase in theta. Participants in MORE who showed the biggest increases in theta waves reported more intense experiences of self-transcendence during meditation, including the sense of one’s ego fading away, a sense of oneness with the universe or feelings of blissful energy and love.\nMindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement Significantly Increased Self-Transcendent Experiences\nThe Effect of MORE on Reducing Opioid Misuse was Mediated by Increased Frontal Midline Theta\nMORE also led to significant decreases in opioid misuse through the nine-month follow-up. These reductions in opioid misuse were caused in part by the increases in frontal midline theta brain waves. Garland explained that by achieving “tastes of self-transcendence” through meditation, the mindfulness therapy boosted theta waves in the frontal lobes of the brain to help participants gain self-control over their addictive behaviors.\n“Mindfulness can create a pathway for us to transcend our limited sense of self,” said Garland. “Civilizations have known for thousands of years that self-transcendence, the experience of being connected to something greater than ourselves, has powerful therapeutic benefits.”\nThis, he explained, is a part of why some cultures engage in spiritual practices, practice deep meditation or use psychedelic substances like psilocybin mushrooms. Even in the popular 12-step addiction treatment program, the 11th step—seeking conscious contact with a higher power through prayer or meditation—taps into this same mechanism to promote recovery from addiction.\nThe state of transcendence can be like a blissful, natural high. Garland stated, “Rather than seeking a high from something outside of yourself like a drug, meditation can help you to find an even greater sense of pleasure, peace and fulfillment from within.”\nCredit: https://attheu.utah.edu/research/mindfulness-training-provides-a-natural-high-study-finds/\nShare this:\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLike this:\nLike Loading...\nTagged addiction, brain, chronic pain, craving, EEG, mindfulness, Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement, MORE, mystical, neuroscience, oneness, opioids, psychedelics, theta, transcendence\nPublished by drericgarland\nView all posts by drericgarland\nPost navigation\nMORE’s Efficacy for Opioid Misuse and Chronic Pain Shown in JAMA\nStruggling with Chronic Pain?\nDo you manage chronic pain with prescription medication?

Dr. Bernstein's presentation, \"Follicular Unit Extraction: Then and Now,\" was a review of the evolution of surgical hair restoration from Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) through Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) to the cutting edge technique of Robotic-FUE.\nThe presentation described the steps that resulted in the use, and growth in popularity, of the state-of-the-art ARTAS Robotic System for FUE. Dr. Bernstein pointed out that with the introduction of each procedure — FUT, FUE, and Robotic-FUE — there was initially a rocky reception with physicians. In each instance, however, the surgeons' concerns were overcome first by strong, patient interest and then by clinical studies that confirmed the procedures' usefulness.\nDr. Bernstein discussed how FUE procedures progressed from the use of hand-held instruments to the computer-assisted, image-guided ARTAS Robot. One of the initial hurdles of FUE procedures using hand-held devices was a high rate of follicular unit transection (cutting of the follicles). Restoration Robotics, Inc., the company that developed the ARTAS system, used a \"sharp/blunt\" punch technique that was introduced by Jim Harris in his 2004 publication on the SAFE System for FUE. The sharp/blunt technique, that was validated in 2006 by Dr. Bernstein's research publication, \"New Instrumentation for Three-Step Follicular Unit Extraction,\" reduced transection of follicles when compared to older instrumentation. Dr. Bernstein then detailed modifications to the system that he proposed in order to improve the ARTAS robot. These improvements include: a smaller tip for the sharp/blunt punch, selection of larger over smaller follicular units, tensioner placement, 'feathering' the ends of the tensioner, and pre-making recipient sites before extracting the follicular unit grafts.\nLooking to the future, Dr. Bernstein mapped out the further evolution of the Robotic FUE procedure and the tasks it will be required to perform. In future procedures, the physician will not only guide the robot on extracting follicular units, but also in creating recipient sites and, further down the road, placing grafts into the recipient sites. Graft placement will represent the most significant challenge to the robotic system as this step is the most sensitive to patient to patient variability. Once this last step is accomplished, a fully automated hair transplant should be possible, eliminating much of the human error in the mechanical aspects of the hair restoration process.\nTags: ARTAS Robot for FUE, Follicular Unit Extraction, Follicular Unit Extraction: Then and Now, Follicular Unit Transplant, FUT, Future of Hair Transplantation, Hair Follicle Transection, Hair Transplant History, Hair Transplant Innovations, Hair Transplant Instruments, New Instrumentation for Three-Step Follicular Unit Extraction, Pre-Making Recipient Sites, Restoration Robotics, Robotics in FUE, Robotics News, SAFE System for FUE\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2016 May 6;65(17):443-50. doi: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6517e1.\nSusanna N Visser, Melissa L Danielson, Mark L Wolraich, Michael H Fox, Scott D Grosse, Linda A Valle, Joseph R Holbrook, Angelika H Claussen, Georgina Peacock\nPMID: 27149047\nDOI: 10.15585/mmwr.mm6517e1\nBackground: Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with adverse outcomes and elevated societal costs. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 2011 guidelines recommend \"behavior therapy\" over medication as first-line treatment for children aged 4-5 years with ADHD; these recommendations are consistent with current guidelines from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry for younger children. CDC analyzed claims data to assess national and state-level ADHD treatment patterns among young children.\nMethods: CDC compared Medicaid and employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) claims for \"psychological services\" (the procedure code category that includes behavior therapy) and ADHD medication among children aged 2-5 years receiving clinical care for ADHD, using the MarketScan commercial database (2008-2014) and Medicaid (2008-2011) data. Among children with ESI, ADHD indicators were compared during periods preceding and following the 2011 AAP guidelines.\nResults: In both Medicaid and ESI populations, the percentage of children aged 2-5 years receiving clinical care for ADHD increased over time; however, during 2008-2011, the percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving clinical care was double that of ESI beneficiaries. Although state percentages varied, overall nationally no more than 55% of children with ADHD received psychological services annually, regardless of insurance type, whereas approximately three fourths received medication. Among children with ESI, the percentage receiving psychological services following release of the guidelines decreased significantly by 5%, from 44% in 2011 to 42% in 2014; the change in medication treatment rates (77% in 2011 compared with 76% in 2014) was not significant.\nConclusions and comments: Among insured children aged 2-5 years receiving clinical care for ADHD, medication treatment was more common than receipt of recommended first-line treatment with psychological services. Among children with ADHD who had ESI, receipt of psychological services did not increase after release of the 2011 guidelines. Scaling up evidence-based behavior therapy might lead to increased delivery of effective ADHD management without the side effects of ADHD medications.\nHome > Military TBI Topics > Diagnosing & Treating Brain Injury > Hope for Biomarkers to Diagnose Brain Injuries\tEmail Share Hope for Biomarkers to Diagnose Brain Injuries\nSo where are we with regards to biomarker research and actually potentially getting a biomarker diagnostic platform, not only in theater but available to the civilian community. So where are we? Well, we're actually quite advanced at this point in time. I mean, this research has been going on. I like to believe that my group and the group at the University of Florida are really the first to conceive of this concept that-- just like the troponin enzyme test for heart failure, which is the standard of care diagnostic-- that we can do the same thing with brain injury. We went through several years of animal research to generate the type of data that we thought was going to be needed to convince the Army that we're on the right track and that we can make this happen. I'm not a molecular biologist, but I learned very quickly that we had some very significant challenges particularly on what they call the assays-- the test platforms to identify whether a molecule--a material that's in the brain-- has changed enough. The Army helped support a human studies trial in moderate and severe brain injuries, and we had over a course of 2-1/2 years, we completed a 200-patient study demonstrating very convincingly that there are certain biomarkers that will change. There are certain proteins that will change in the brain and only in the brain when the brain is hurt. Of course it is much easier to see that in a very severe TBI, but it gives you the--what's called proof of concept data. And with additional money from the Department of Defense and Congressional add-ons that came about because of the TBI problem, we were able to complete a preliminary study in 80-some concussion patients again with very promising results, and this is real--this is hard-core research. The severe data has been published in peer-review journals, and the data from the pivotal--no, from the preliminary study is being examined now by reviewers to be published in research journals. And as a result of that, the Army is funding a major pivotal trial to generate enough data on a specific device platform to then take that to the FDA for approval. One thing about the military-- military medicine--our regulations are that no therapy, no treatment, no diagnostic platform will go into theater and be introduced into our soldiers without FDA approval. So that's the yardstick that we must meet even though we're the military. People seem to think you can do whatever you want. No, not at all.

Other early research studies finished with animals have actually revealed that CBD might assist alleviate stress and anxiety by:\nCBD has remained in the news prior to, as a possible treatment for epilepsy. Research is still in its early days. Researchers are evaluating how much CBD is able to reduce the number of seizures in people with epilepsy, along with how safe it is. The American Epilepsy Society mentions that cannabidiol research uses expect seizure disorders, which research is currently being performed to much better comprehend safe usage.\nA research study Relied on Source from 2016 worked with 214 individuals with epilepsy. The study individuals added oral dosages of 2 to 5mg of CBD each day to their existing anti-epilepsy medications. The research study's scientists kept track of the participants for 12 weeks, taping any unfavorable adverse effects and checking on the frequency of their seizures. In general, participants had 36.5 percent less seizures per month. However, serious adverse results were recorded in 12 percent of the individuals.\nAlzheimer's disease several sclerosis (MS) Parkinson's disease stroke CBD oil might likewise lower the inflammation that can make neurodegenerative signs even worse. More research is needed to fully understand the impacts of CBD oil for neurodegenerative illness.\nThe results of CBD oil on your brain's receptors might also assist you handle pain. Studies have shown that marijuana can use some advantages when taken after chemotherapy treatments. Other pre-clinical research studies sponsored by the National Institutes of Health are also looking at the role of marijuana in eliminating signs brought on by:.\narthritis persistent pain MS discomfort muscle discomfort spinal cord injuries Nabiximols (Sativex), a multiple sclerosis drug made from a combination of TCH and CBD, is authorized in the UK and Canada to treat MS pain. Nevertheless, researchers think the CBD in the drug might be contributing more with its anti-inflammatory properties than by acting versus the discomfort. Clinical trials of CBD are necessary to determine whether or not it ought to be used for pain management.\nThe results of CBD on receptors in the immune system may help reduce overall swelling in the body. In turn, CBD oil might offer benefits for acne management. A human study released in the Journal of Scientific Examination found that the oil prevented activity in sebaceous glands. These glands are responsible for producing sebum, a natural oily substance that hydrates the skin. Excessive sebum, however, can cause acne.\nSome research studies have investigated the role of CBD in preventing cancer cell development, but research is still in its early stages. The National Cancer Institute Trusted Source (NCI) says that CBD might help ease cancer symptoms and cancer treatment negative effects. Nevertheless, the NCI doesn't completely endorse any kind of marijuana as a cancer treatment. The action of CBD that's promising for cancer treatment is its ability to moderate inflammation and alter how cell recreate. CBD has the impact of decreasing the capability of some kinds of tumor cells to recreate.\nCBD is drawn out from cannabis plants as either an oil or powder. These can be mixed into creams or gels. They can be put into capsules and taken orally, or rubbed on your skin. The several sclerosis drug nabiximols is sprayed as a liquid into your mouth. How CBD ought to be used depends largely on what it's being used for. Talk to your medical professional before using CBD oil. It hasn't been approved by the U.S. Fda (FDA) for any medical uses, and it can have side effects.\nWhat is the Best Treatment for a Soft Tissue Lump Under Eye After Blepharoplasty? Doctor Answers, Tips\nWhat is the Best Treatment for a Soft Tissue Lump Under Eye After Blepharoplasty?\nU & L bleph – Healed quickly - stiches out in 1 week. Suddenly, 3 weeks after surgery, a soft tissue lump formed under 1 eye. I saw the doctor, and he said it looks like my body is overcorrecting healing, so it's pooling tissue and blood vessels in the area. He suggested massage and wait it out. He said he can inject it to dissolve the tissue if it doesn't resolve on its own. So far it hasn't resolved, and I am concerned about the injection as a treatment. Going to see my doc again next week.\nIt's common to get little areas of activity or fibrosis or focal swelling after any surgery, and the limited soft tissue coverage around the eyes makes bumps here well known. So your situation is not alarming, and most likely will resolve with just time. Massage is valuable, as well as the knowledge that your doc has a solution if nothing is improving by the third month. Sounds like you are well covered, and your doc remains invested in you too.\nFollow progression closely\nKeep an eye on it to see how it progresses. Often, abnormalities resolve on their own so injections may not be necessary.\nLump under eye after blepharoplasty\nI would recommend following the area closely. After 3 weeks most significant swelling should be resolved but there can be a collection of fluid or blood remaining. I would not recommend any type injections yet. If the area does not correct with another month I would return to your surgeon to have the area reevaluated. Hope this information helps you.\nThis early after surgery you can encounter lumps like you mentioned. It sounds like you're following this closely with your surgeon so I would follow his advice as he knows you best and has examined the area. Performing a dilute steroid injection to help with the problem may be indicated, but it would require an examination to find this out.\nLearn more: http://www.drlamperti.com/faial-plastic-surgery/blepharoplasty\nLump after blepharoplasty.\nI would not inject anything into the lid for several MONTHS and wait and it should resolve without any treatment.\nHonestly, you still are under the care and supervision of the plastic and cosmetic surgeon that did your Eyelid Surgery and should follow his/her instructions.\nYour surgeons recommendations seem reasonable at this time. Massaging the area should help settle any scarring that is taking place. An injection of a steroid might also be indicated and seeing our surgeon next week is a good idea.\nJumping in too soon after surgery will only complicated and likely worsen things, so I would urge patience to allow your body to heal.\nLower blepharoplasty healing\nDue to lack of pictures it is not possible to provide relevant recommendations or advice. Scar contraction or small pocket of fluid in the surgical field is part of normal healing process. You are still very fresh post-op and going through the healing process. At this point, conservative measures such as the ones your doctor has recommended are the standard approach. I would normally recommend conservative measures for at least the first 3 months post-operative and only then perform a surgical touch-up if there isn't a significant improvement.\nPharmacist Jobs in Manchester, Connecticut | PharmaceuticalCrossing.com\n\"pharmacist jobs in manchester ct\"\nTitleStaff Pharmacist Floater PTNo. of Positions2Position SummarySummary: Health is everything.

        "description": "Drugs That Can Cause Liver Damage | Banyan Treatment Centers Pompano\nDrug-induced liver disease is often the result of substance abuse or long-term use of certain medications.\nIn severe cases, drug-induced liver injury can result in liver failure, which may require hospitalization and a liver transplant. This damage can be worse when the individual uses multiple substances at a time. As a Pompano substance abuse treatment center, we understand the effects of drugs on the liver and want to share a list of both illicit and prescription drugs that can cause liver damage.\nWhat Drugs Cause Liver Damage?\nThe possibility of experiencing liver damage from medication is widespread knowledge. If you've ever been prescribed any medications, you may recall your doctor warning you about the impact of drugs and what those drugs can do to your liver, especially if you take higher doses than prescribed or if you mix them with other substances, like alcohol. But if prescription drugs can cause liver damage, imagine what street drugs can do to this organ. Below are some medications and illegal drugs that can cause liver damage.\nMany studies on drug abuse and liver disease have found acetaminophen to be a common culprit. Acetaminophen is a medication that's used to treat moderate to severe pain and is often used in conjunction with opiates to reduce fever. Also known as Tylenol, acetaminophen is also available in many over-the-counter medications such as Actifed, Alka-Seltzer Plus Liquid Gels, Cepacol, Contac, Nyquil, and more. However, this drug is also known for causing liver damage when taken in excess. When people follow the recommended dose of this drug, they're relatively safe. However, many people often take higher doses for pain relief or may misuse drugs that contain this ingredient, increasing their risk of liver damage and even overdose.\nAcetaminophen causes liver damage by overwhelming the glutathione pathway with its metabolite, NAPQI. Your cells contain glutathione, a substance that acts as an antioxidant in your body and detoxifies chemicals like pollutants and drugs. When someone takes too much acetaminophen, it overwhelms this pathway, causing the toxic compounds to accumulate in the liver, impairing its ability to rid the body of toxins and causing damage. Additionally, as with other medications, mixing acetaminophen with other drugs or alcohol can also increase the likelihood of developing liver problems. If you notice that a loved one is misusing their medications or if you're struggling with this yourself, our prescription drug addiction treatment at Banyan Pompano can help.\nInhalants are substances that people usually use only by inhaling, such as solvents, aerosol sprays, gases, and nitrites. Inhalants are various products that can be purchased or found in homes or workplaces, including spray paints, keyboard cleaners, air fresheners, glues, markers, and cleaning fluids. When these substances are used to get high, they're referred to as inhalants. Inhalants contain psychoactive or mind-altering properties that can produce euphoria, hallucinations, lightheadedness, and breathing problems.\nIn addition to liver damage and failure, inhalants can also cause long-term problems like hearing loss, bone marrow damage, and brain damage. Of their side effects, the most common and concerning is asphyxiation, in which the person doesn't get enough oxygen to the brain, causing coma and permanent damage. Certain inhalants, specifically toluene, are also more harmful to the liver when the person is a heavy drinker.\nHeroin is an illegal opioid that's highly harmful and addictive. It's most commonly smoked or injected for the euphoric and sedative side effects it produces. In addition to liver damage, heroin is also known to produce lung disease, insomnia, mental illness, sexual dysfunction, fertility issues, nasal problems, scarred or collapsed veins, soft tissue infection, and more. When a person injects heroin, it enters the liver via the bloodstream. The liver's job is to detoxify these drugs and remove them from the body. Most drugs are fat-soluble, meaning they're difficult to pass through urine. The liver corrects this issue by breaking down these substances and converting them into water-soluble forms so they can be passed through bile or urine. While it's normal for the liver to do this every once in a while, chronic drug use forces the organ to work twice as hard. Therefore, heroin liver damage is the result of chronic drug abuse, which forces the liver to constantly detoxify itself and the body, basically wearing it out.\nCocaine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that's also highly addictive and damaging to the body. Often made with other cutting agents like fentanyl and paint thinner, crack, or coke is known for causing serious physical damage. Cocaine liver damage is the result of the drug's impact on liver enzyme levels. Cocaine effects on the liver include:\nRhabdomyolysis (leakage of muscle contents into blood circulation)\nMoreover, as with any other substance, whenever the liver is constantly flooded with toxins, it's being overworked to the point where it stops functioning properly. Long-term cocaine use also increases a person's chances of cardiovascular disease, overdose, and death. If you're addicted to cocaine, our cocaine rehab can help you regain your health and sobriety before it's too late.\nMethamphetamine is another CNS stimulant that's derived from amphetamine. Like cocaine, meth can be smoked, injected, or swallowed. When used, meth increases alertness, energy, and physiological functions like breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. Long-term meth use is commonly associated with problems like skin disease (meth face) and tooth decay (meth mouth), but it can also severely damage the liver. Crystal meth liver damage is usually the result of hyperthermia or abnormally high body temperature. Hyperthermia is believed to cause oxidative stress and depleting glutathione, which can cause cell and tissue damage as well as affect the liver's ability to break down toxins and detoxify the body. Without the help of meth treatment, those who are dependent on this drug are more likely to suffer from organ failure of all kinds as well as overdose.\nDextromethorphan or DXM is an over-the-counter (OTC) cough suppressant. Robotripping, dexing, and skittling are common names for DMX abuse, which is done to experience a range of physical and psychological side effects. Although DXM is an OTC drug, people who abuse it usually do so by taking dangerously high doses. Not only does constantly flooding the liver with any kind of drug damage it, but OTC drugs often contain acetaminophen as well, which we've already established how damaging it can be to the liver. When used in high doses, DXM can lead to hepatitis and liver toxicity.\n13 Warning Signs of Liver Disease\nOver time, certain conditions that cause liver damage can lead to scarring (cirrhosis), which can cause liver failure. However, early detection and treatment can give the liver time to heal. Although liver disease isn't always noticeable, some signs and symptoms of liver disease include:\nIf you're addicted to drugs or alcohol, you're at a higher risk of liver disease, cardiovascular disease, organ failure, and overdose.

A first meeting of awardees, part of which will be open to other interested Center faculty, will be held in March in Orlando in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Academy for Medical Imaging.\nAs a reminder, the concept of the IRATs grew out of discussions between the Association of American Cancer Institutes and the NCI. IRAT supplemental awards are intended to facilitate the development of a Cancer Center core that will advance the role of imaging in assessment of response to therapy and increase the application of quantitative, anatomic, functional, and molecular imaging endpoints in clinical therapeutic trials. Integration of IRAT team members into the protocol planning process and increasing clinical collaborations between imaging scientists and oncologic investigators is also a goal. When the three year supplemental funding ends, each Center should have a committed shared resource.\nThe IRAT Network—the IRAT leaders and NCI leaders—and their collaborators will convene for their first workshop, March 24–25, 2006, in Orlando. The workshop will be an affiliate event of the Academy of Molecular Imaging's (AMI) annual conference at the Gaylord Palms Resort and Convention Center, March 25–29. The IRAT workshop will include a special session, Saturday, March 25, 12:00 to 2:00 p.m., that will be open to the greater scientific and cancer center communities interested in and currently working on issues related to the assessment of response to therapy via imaging techniques, and we are encouraging interested scientists from all centers to attend.\nInformation about the AMI conference may be accessed through their website at http://www.ami-imaging.org/conference2006/index.htm.

Previously, we reported that contact with NDMA as well as the ESP of boosts HEK293T cell proliferation as well as the percentage of cells within the G2/M stage [3]. CHCA is certainly potentially due to increased degrees of proinflammatory cytokines and nuclear aspect kappa B (NFB), which regulate the actions of cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and disturb the homeostasis of DNA and oxidants/anti-oxidants fix Nevirapine (Viramune) enzymes [13]. CDC7 ESPs of induce pro-inflammatory replies with the upregulation of TLR4 and its own downstream transduction indicators, including MyD88-reliant IB- degradation and NFB activation [14, 15]. NFB may impact the creation of Cx43 also, a gap-junction proteins, in liver organ cirrhosis [16, 17]. Difference Nevirapine (Viramune) junctions are clusters of transmembrane stations in the cell membrane that permit immediate intercellular exchange of ions, supplementary messengers, and little signaling substances influencing cell development, differentiation, and cancerous adjustments [17C21]. Among difference junction protein, Cx43 is involved with almost all guidelines from the inflammatory response of cells, cytokine creation, and inflammatory cell migration [17, 20, 22]. The significant function of Cx43 in carcinogenesis is certainly highlighted by the actual fact that high degrees of Cx-43 appearance raise the invasion of breasts tumor cells and promote tumors in melanoma [22]. Modifications of Cx appearance have already been reported in cancers [21, 23]. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for example, decreased Cx32 appearance is associated with increased appearance of Cx43, which promotes HCC via cell-to-cell conversation [16, 20, 23]. Fujimoto et al. [23] show that Cx32 includes a suppressive impact in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Nevertheless, the function of connexins in cancers is certainly questionable [23] still, as well as the impact of difference junctions in CHCA due to has not however been examined. In this scholarly study, to look for the systems root the carcinogenic ramifications of ESP from as well as the carcinogen NDMA. We discovered that the silencing of Cx43 decreased ESP- and NDMA-induced cell proliferation as well as the appearance of Cox-2. Methods Animals The animal experimental protocol was approved and reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Seoul National University Health System, Seoul, Korea (approval no. SNU-060511-1) and followed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guideline for the care and use of laboratory animals (NIH publication no. 85C23, 1985, revised 1996). The facility is usually accredited by the Ministry of Food and Drug Administration Nevirapine (Viramune) and by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (LNL08-402) as an animal experiment facility. Male SpragueCDawley rats at 6 weeks of age were purchased from Koatech Co. (Seoul, Korea) and housed in an ABL-2 animal facility at Seoul National University College of Medicine. All rats were bred in filter cages under positive pressure according to institutionally approved guidelines. Recovery of metacercariae of were collected by digestion of fish with pepsin-HCl (0.6%) artificial gastric juice for 1 h at 37 C, then filtering the digestion answer through a 200? stainless steel filter.

There are millions of people in the United States that suffer from this sleep breathing disorder, yet many are totally unaware that they have it. However, there certainly are some myths about sleep apnea that just aren't true. Your San Francisco sleep apnea dentists at Glen Park Dental are here to debunk these myths!\nMyth #1: Sleep apnea is no big deal\nSnoring is the major warning sign of sleep apnea. While snoring may not seem like a big deal, it actually is harmful to your health. Obstructive sleep apnea means that the airway is either partially or completely blocked, which means that your body is not getting enough air. This can increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, or diabetes.\nPlus, for children, untreated sleep apnea can hinder their development, and lead to behavioral issues, which may lead to overmedication of ADD or ADHD when instead, a sleep breathing disorder is to blame. Sleep apnea will not go away, and needs treatment by a qualified sleep apnea doctor in the Bay Area.\nMyth #2: Sleep apnea only affects overweight people\nWhile the risk of sleep apnea significantly increases for obese individuals, anyone of any age or size, even athletes, can develop this sleep breathing disorder. This is why a sleep apnea screening in the Bay Area is essential for all individuals who snore or who have chronic fatigue, regardless of stature. Parents, you should pay attention to your child as they sleep, and make note if you notice they snore at all. Snoring is not healthy for children, or even adults.\nMyth #3: Sleep apnea can be self-diagnosed\nTelltale signs of sleep apnea such as snoring and chronic fatigue are often associated with this disorder. However, the only way to truly know whether you suffer from this disorder is to receive a sleep apnea test in San Francisco from the doctors at Glen Park Dental. Believe it or not, but your dentist is one of the most qualified individuals to diagnose and treat sleep apnea.\nKeep in mind that sometimes people with sleep apnea may snore very little or not at all, which is why a screening can be helpful for everyone.\nGetting treatment for your sleep apnea may be easier than you think. At Glen Park Dental, we do not use the CPAP machine to treat this sleep breathing disorder. Since many CPAP users get frustrated with their machine and discontinue its use within a few months, this leaves them vulnerable to the health risks associated with the disorder. Therefore, many of our patients experience relief by wearing a custom-made oral appliance that helps to reposition their lower jaw into proper alignment, thus facilitating an open airway while sleeping. This noninvasive means of treating sleep apnea can be comfortable, yet effective.\nTo learn more about sleep apnea or to seek better treatment than using a CPAP, please contact Glen Park Dental by calling (415) 585-1500 to schedule a consultation.\nPrinceton Identity implements iris recognition for access control at long term care facility | Biometric Update\nPrinceton Identity implements iris recognition for access control at long term care facility\nDec 2, 2016, 4:33 pm EST | Stephen Mayhew\nPrinceton Identity recently implemented an iris recognition solution at a long term care and independent residential/retirement facility in Erie, Pennsylvania to make access control procedures easier and more convenient for residents and staff.\nThe solution involved adding two IOM (Identity on the Move) Walk-Through Identity systems and six IOM Access Control readers in the personal care building. IOM readers are installed on four sets of doors at two heights – a lower position for those in wheelchairs and a higher position for those who can stand or use crutches or a walker. Once enrolled, users simply glance at the iris reader without having to remove glasses or place their eyes close to the device. Authentication is confirmed in less than a second, and the door can be opened. Because of the system's ease of use and reliable accuracy, the staff at the facility also enrolled in the system. The building's previous access control system was left in place as a back-up.\n\"This project highlights some of the advantages of iris recognition in healthcare and assisted-living applications,\" said Mark Clifton, CEO, Princeton Identity. \"Many facilities need to support users with a wide range of physical limitations and challenges. Iris recognition is a great fit for these cases because it is fast and easy for users, doesn't require a free hand, and maintains safety and security.\"\nLast month, Princeton Identity was selected to receive the Outstanding Technology Development Company Award for 2016 by the New Jersey Tech Council.\nDietary Glycemic load, added sugars, and carbohydrates as risk factors for pancreatic cancer: the Multiethnic Cohort Study\nNothlings U1,3, Murphy SP1, Wilkens LR1, Henderson BE2, Kolonel LN1. Dietary glycemic load, added sugars, and carbohydrates as risk factors for pancreatic cancer: the Multiethnic Cohort Study. Am J Clin Nutr 2007;86:1495-1501\nBackground\nThis article is yet another published in AJCN seeking to establish a link between dietary fructose and increased risk for some metabolic perturbation: pancreatic cancer, in this instance. The authors are from the University of Hawaii1 (Honolulu), the University of Southern California2 (Los Angeles) and the German Institute of Human Nutrition Potsdam-Rehbruecke3 (Nuthetal). They are active cancer researchers and appear to be seeking causative factors for pancreatic cancer.\nHypothesis\nThe authors begin with the hypothesis that a high dietary glycemic load (GL) is positively associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer. GL is the product of [the experimentally measured serum glucose response after consumption of a specific food or ingredient (glycemic index, GI)] x [the carbohydrate content of the food or ingredient]. GL is now thought by nutritionists to be a better predictor of serum insulin response than GI alone.\nThe authors justify their hypothesis by citing previous studies suggesting that glucose metabolism plays a role in the development of pancreatic cancer. In this study, GL and carbohydrate intakes were mathematically derived from the amounts and types of foods consumed by participants as reported in an extensive self-administered questionnaire.\nAuthor Conclusions\nHigh sugar intake — fructose intake, specifically — was associated with a greater risk of pancreatic cancer.\nThe purported association between fructose and weight gain is not appropriate, since HFCS has largely supplanted sucrose on a 1-for-1 basis, resulting in no net gain of fructose in the diet relative to other nutrients (9).\nPancreatic cancer risk increased with higher intakes of total sugars, fructose and sucrose.\nThe association between fructose and increased pancreatic cancer risk became significant when the highest and lowest fructose consumers were compared.\nThe association between fruit and juice intakes and pancreatic cancer risk was significant.\nThe association between caloric soda intake and pancreatic cancer risk was not significant.\nSucrose (sugar) intake was associated with increased BMI (body mass index) for overweight and obese, but not normal-weight, subjects when the highest and lowest consumers were compared.\nCritique\nIt seems rather implausible that fructose, but not added sugars (half fructose), would be associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. The solution to this inconsistency may be the unconventional use of terminology by the authors: ‘added sugars’ is here applied to spoonfuls of sugar added to foods, while the term is commonly used in nutrition circles to mean all dietary nutritive sweeteners not intrinsically present in foods and beverages.\nIt seems even more implausible that fruits and juices, but not caloric sodas (half fructose), would be associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer, since both share similar compositions. The solution to this inconsistency may lie in the amounts consumed: the authors claim that study participants derived more fructose from fruits and juices than from other dietary sources, including caloric soft drinks. Since the data are inexplicably absent, we are forced to accept their explanation. Would the authors advise that the public cut back on fruit consumption? Surely such advice is counterintuitive and ill-considered.\nThough the authors hypothesize that high dietary GL is associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer, they do not report dietary glucose intakes. This seems a glaring oversight since glucose is accepted to be the most insulinogenic component in the diet and is accordingly given a GI value of 100, the standard against which others compounds are compared. Pure glucose also has the highest GL. By comparison, fructose has a GI of about 20.\nSince glucose and fructose are equally present and track together in nutritive sweeteners (except pure fructose, pure glucose and corn syrups), fruits/juices and caloric soft drinks, any calculation of fructose intake from dietary questionnaires should yield roughly equivalent intake figures for glucose.\nWhen glucose from other dietary sources is added (cereal grains; starch, maltodextrin, corn syrup and glucose ingredients), the intake of glucose is clearly higher than fructose. Forshee et.al. (1) estimated the ratio of fructose-to-glucose at 0.7, a ratio that did not change with the advent of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS).\nDespite the authors’ conclusion that GL is not associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer, parallel glucose-fructose tracking must cast doubt on the uniqueness of the conclusion that fructose intake is associated with greater risk of pancreatic cancer — this conclusion can and should be extended to glucose as well.\nFructose intakes calculated for participants in the Multiethnic Cohort Study were 4-6% of calories (Table 1, p.1497). These intakes are considerably lower than previous estimates for the general population: Park & Yetley in 1993 estimated fructose intakes at 8% of calories for the whole population (2). More recent estimates have placed fructose intake as high as 12 to nearly 20% of calories. The solution to this inconsistency may also lie with the terminology used: Park & Yetley summed fructose from all dietary sources — both free fructose and that from sucrose — while these authors seem to be reporting free fructose separately from sucrose and added sugars (tabletop). Clearly, Park & Yetley’s approach is the correct one.\nIn summary, the authors failed to prove the original hypothesis that GL is positively associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer. They appear to have turned to fructose as an alternative in an effort to salvage a result from their rather disjointed, inconsistent and incomprehensible data.\nReferences\nForshee R, Storey M, Allison D, et al.

Yong-Uon Ha and Youjae Yi, Duluth, MN : Association for Consumer Research, Pages: 78.\nAsia Pacific Advances in Consumer Research Volume 6, 2005 Page 78\nSeigyoung Auh, Brock University, Canada\nChuan-Fong Shih, Wake Forest University, U.S.A.\nAs consumers increasingly use debt and installment payments to finance durable goods, understanding of how financing decisions are made can allow marketers to better design financing schemes that will stimulate purchases.\nIn a typical financing scenario, the consumer makes payments for an agreed upon time period and in exchange uses the product and reaps the benefits that are derived from consumption. Research has shown that consumers prefer to match the cost stream associated with the financing payments with the benefit streams that accrue from using the product (Hirst, Joyce, and Schadewald 1994; Prelec and Loewenstein 1998). When unbalance between the two types of stream occur, people are less likely to choose financing as a method of payment. This has been one of the primary reasons for people's hesitance for financing services such as vacations since the benefits terminate once the trip is over but the payments used for financing the trip continue (Hirst, Joyce, and Schadewald 1994).\nFirst, we attempt to capture how consumers prefer to match the length of benefit streams with the length of cost streams (experiment 1). We specifically address this in the context of a widely used and accepted promotion, payment deferrals. Second, whereas prior research has found a linear pattern for mental depreciation of durable goods, we contest this and suggest a non-linear mental depreciation pattern for high-tech products (experiment 2). Third, past research has been solely focused on the temporal contiguity of costs and benefits thereby suggesting that as long as the benefit stream coincides and overlaps with the cost stream, consumers will be favorable towards financing (Hirst, Joyce, and Schadewald 1994). We build and extend this argument by asserting that it is not only the length of cost and benefit streams that are relevant but also the pattern of costs and benefits that is of utmost importance in determining consumer's preference for financing (experiment 3). Thus, we tested the presence and validity of the matching between the benefit and payment streams, the alignment hypothesis, in a series of three experiments.\nIn three experiments, we confirmed the presence of the alignment hypothesis in consumer financing decisions. Experiment 1 confirmed consumer's preference for temporal contiguity between the benefits accrued from using products with the payments resulting from using a financing scheme. In experiment 2, we examine the alignment hypothesis by testing for the possibility of non-linearity in the benefits that accrue from using high-tech products or more generally, products that become obsolete quickly over time. Our study found that durable products may have a different rate of mental depreciation. Products with a high newness premium such as computers have a kinked mental depreciation curve such that there is greater depreciation early in the product's life than in the later parts. Products which provide stable benefits in its life cycle instead exhibit a linear depreciation curve. Finally, in experiment 3, we build on this non-linear benefit pattern to explicitly test our alignment hypothesis and find that consumers prefer to align their payment stream to their product's mental depreciation pattern.\nHirst, D.

He also said wearing a face mask probably is better protection against COVID-19 than will be a vaccine.\n“I think he made a mistake,” Trump said at a White House press briefing.\n“We’ll be able to distribute at least 100 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020 and a large number much sooner than that,” Trump said. “Under no circumstance will it be as late as the doctor said.”\nTrump said that he called Redfield to express his displeasure.\n“When I called up Robert today, I said to him, ‘What’s with the mask?’ He said, ‘I think I answered that question incorrectly.’ I think maybe he misunderstood it, I mean you know, you have two questions — maybe misunderstood both of them.”\nThe CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Post about whether Redfield misspoke.\nTrump called upon his coronavirus adviser Dr. Scott Atlas to confirm that Redfield was incorrect about the likely speed of vaccine distribution. Atlas said current plans would see production of 700 million vaccine doses by the end of March.\n“There will be 700 million doses by end of Q1,” Atlas said.\nAtlas said that “all the refrigerators that are necessary, everything is going to be a place for this,” meaning distribution delays won’t push public vaccination til summer.\nTrump said at the press briefing that a vaccine would be available “to the general public immediately. When we go, we go. We’re not looking to say, ‘Gee in six months we’re going to start giving it to the general public.’ No, we want to go immediately.”\nTrump rarely wears a mask and said “a vaccine is much more effective than the mask.”\nRedfield told senators that “this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me than the vaccine.”\nThe CDC leader said about vaccine distribution: “There will be vaccine that will initially be available sometime between November and December, but very limited supply and will have to be prioritized … If you’re asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life, I think we’re probably looking at late second quarter, third quarter 2021.”\nOn Wednesday, the Defense Department and Department of Health and Human Services released plans for vaccine distribution amid hopes for positive results in October from clinical trials.\nThe Trump administration plan calls for rapid distribution of a vaccine free of cost and anticipates two doses administered 21 to 28 days apart. Health care workers and vulnerable people would be prioritized in the first wave.\nPublications > Newsletter > Past Issues > October 2013 > Public Affairs\nUS Classifies R&D as an Investment\nCatching up with the common viewpoint among scientists that funding research is an investment in the future, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), which is part of the US Department of Commerce, has reclassified research and development costs from an \"expense\" to an \"investment\" when calculating the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Prior to 2013, expenditures on research and development were treated as intermediate inputs—neither true inputs or outputs—and not included in the calculation of GDP. The change was made to reflect international guidelines for national economic statistics. The reclassification is important to the scientific research community because it supports the notion that spending on research and development is a worthwhile expenditure, even in lean times.\nAdvocates for research hope that Congress will start to view R&D spending as an investment as it finalizes the federal budget for 2014 and must make even deeper cuts to agency budgets, unless it stops sequestration. In a letter sent to Congress over the summer, 165 university presidents and chancellors, representing all 50 states, called on the president and Congress to reverse the pending \"innovation deficit.\" The letter points out that with more than half of the economic growth in the US since World War II attributable to innovation, the US economy is at risk if the current trajectory of decreased federal investment in research is allowed to continue.\nMore information on the reclassification can be found at http://1.usa.gov/17oEhFT.\nFollowing on the heels of two reports that suggested ways the Department of Energy (DOE) could be more effective, Secretary Moniz announced over the summer that he was restructuring the Department. In an effort to integrate the work of basic science and applied research with technology demonstrations and deployment, the Office of the Under Secretary for Science will now be the Office of Under Secretary for Science and Energy and will manage the following departments:\nOffice of Science,\nOffice of Fossil Energy,\nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,\nOffice of Nuclear Energy,\nOffice of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability,\nOffice of Indian Energy, and\nOffice of Technology Transfer Coordinator.\nIn addition, the majority of the DOE-managed national labs now fall under the Office of the Under Secretary for Science and Energy.\nCurrently, the position of Under Secretary for Science, who would lead this office, is vacant.\nTrack NIH Initiatives to Support\nthe Biomedical Workforce The NIH has launched a new website to make it easier to follow how the agency is implementing the 2012 recommendations focused on the biomedical research workforce, issued by an Advisory Committee to the NIH Director. The site will be kept up-to-date with policy notices, grant opportunities, and general information on progress related to seven initiatives the NIH has undertaken and plans to complete by 2015. The website can be found at http://biomedicalresearchworkforce.nih.gov/.\nOne of the initiatives you can read about on the page is the NIH's August announcement encouraging institutions to establish Individual Development Plans (IDPs) for all trainees funded by NIH grants, regardless of grant type. The NIH will be issuing guidance this month and is encouraging all institutions to begin reporting IDP information in October 2014. The information on IDPs can be found under the initiative \"Improve graduate student and postdoctoral researcher training\" on the website.\nEDA-Hip More Instructional Videos | esy-concept\nEDA-Hip More Instructional Videos\nVideos: EDA-Hip Rationale\nIntroducing a new surgical technique into the OR is enhanced in case surgeons, nurses and administrators are well informed about the procedure. We present instructional course videos about the surgical applied anatomy and the step wise EDA-hip procedure. In addition, the EDA-hip is an ESY-concept procedure that aims to improve ergonomics for the team, quality of care for the patient and economics for the hospital. We share our experience about how the EDA-hip was introduced and the economic model for the hospital has become clear.\nVideos: EDA-Hip Surgical Technique\nThe EDA-hip surgical procedure has been made very reproducible by simplifying all steps and thereby making the procedure more efficient in all aspects. The instrumentation has been rationalized to the minimum required to conduct the surgery safely. The procedure consists of 3 major parts: capsular exposure, capsular release and component insertion. All different steps of the procedure are shown in short detailed videos. Overviews of the different steps and the OR set-up can be found under 'EDA Hip team education'. These videos are also dedicated towards the nursing team.\nVideos: EDA-Hip Advanced\nThe EDA-hip procedure is a comprehensive platform that allows conducting complex primary, extensile acetabular and femoral revisions. It is important for the surgeon to understand the surgical applied anatomy and stepwise extensile approaches in case of an intra-operative problem or during revision procedures.\nVideos: EDA-Hip Team Education\nThe EDA-hip procedure specifically focusses on creating an optimal ergonomic working environment for the nursing team. The EDA-hip procedure is a team concept where the nursing team and the surgeons closely and interactively work together in order to optimize the efficiency, ergonomics and quality of care. The OR set-up, the surgical procedure and the OR break down has been made very systematic and reproducible. The educational videos aim to provide information about the most optimal OR set-up and instrumentation sequence. In addition, detailed videos about the different steps of the procedure with a specific focus on retractor sequence and retractor placement are shown. In order to better understand the full OR workflow, overview videos are also provided.\nOfficial General Health Magazine page for women and men!

Allergic rhinitis, the medical term for hay fever and what’s behind the unpleasant seasonal allergy symptoms we all know so well, develops when the body’s immune system becomes sensitized and overreacts to something in the environment.\nToday, 40 to 60 million Americans are affected by allergic rhinitis and the numbers continue to grow, especially in children. When left untreated, allergies can cause blocked and runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, headaches and an impaired sense of smell — but this is in less severe cases. For some people, allergies can be life threatening, leading to inflammation and shortness of breath.\nPeople who suffer from allergies are often told to avoid triggers, but that is nearly impossible when the seasons are changing and our immune systems are impaired by the food industry and environmental toxins. And some allergy meds are linked to dementia and other scary health effects, too. Thankfully, some powerful essential oils serve as a natural and safe way to treat the symptoms of allergies and boost our immune systems. These essential oils for allergies have the ability to chemically support the body and help it to overcome hypersensitivity.\nHow Do Essential Oils Fight Allergies?\nAn allergic reaction begins in the immune system. An allergen is a substance that tricks the immune system — making it think that the allergen is an invader. The immune system then overreacts to the allergen, which is really a harmless substance, and produces Immunoglobulin E antibodies. These antibodies travel to cells that release histamine and other chemicals, causing the allergic reaction.\nThe most common causes of an allergic reaction include:\nPollen\nDust\nMold\nInsect stings\nAnimal dander\nFood\nMedications\nLatex\nThese allergens will trigger symptoms in the nose, throat, lungs, ears, sinuses and lining of the stomach or on the skin. The question here still remains — if these common causes have been around for thousands of years, then why have the allergy rates increased in recent history?\nOne of the theories behind explaining the increase in allergies has to do with inflammation, the root of most diseases. The body responds in a certain way to an allergen because the immune system is in overdrive. When the body is already dealing with high inflammation, any allergen sets off an increased reaction. That means that when the body’s immune system is overworked and stressed, introducing an allergen sends the body into overreaction.\nIf the immune system and inflammation within the body was balanced, the reaction to the allergen would be normal; however, today these reactions are exaggerated and lead to the next unneeded allergic reaction.\nOne of the most amazing benefits of essential oils are their ability to fight inflammation and boost the immune system. Essential oils for allergies will help to detoxify the body and fight infections, bacteria, parasites, microorganisms and harmful toxins. They reduce the bodies susceptibility to outside sources and reduce the overreaction of the immune system when it is faced with a harmless intruder. Some exceptional essential oils even work to relieve respiratory conditions and increase sweat and urination — helping with the elimination of toxins.\nTop 5 Essential Oils for Allergies\n1. Peppermint Oil\nInhaling diffused peppermint oil can oftentimes immediately unclog the sinuses and offer relief to scratchy throats. Peppermint acts as an expectorant and provides relief for allergies, as well as colds, coughs, sinusitis, asthma and bronchitis. It has the power to discharge phlegm and reduce inflammation — a leading cause of allergic reactions.\nA 2010 study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology investigated the effects of peppermint oil in the tracheal rings of rats. The results suggest that peppermint oil is a relaxant and exhibits antispasmodic activity, inhibiting contractions that causes you to cough. (1)\nAnother study published in the European Journal of Medical Research suggests that peppermint oil treatment has anti-inflammatory effects — reducing the symptoms of chronic inflammatory disorders such as allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma. (2)\nRemedy: Diffuse five drops of peppermint essential oil at home to unclog sinuses and treat a scratchy throat. This will also help to relax the nasal muscles, enabling the body to clear out mucus and allergens like pollen. To reduce inflammation, take 1–2 drops of pure peppermint essential oil internally once a day.\nIt can be added to a glass of water, cup of tea or smoothie. Peppermint oil can also be applied topically to the chest, back of neck and temples. For people with sensitive skin, it is best to dilute peppermint with coconut or jojoba oil before topical application.\n2. Basil Oil\nBasil essential oil reduces the inflammatory response of allergens. It also supports the adrenal glands, which are involved in producing over 50 hormones that drive almost every bodily function. Essentially, basil essential oil is helping your body to react appropriately to a threat by rushing blood to your brain, heart and muscles.\nBasil oil also helps to detoxify the body of bacteria and viruses, while fighting inflammation, pain and fatigue. Studies prove that basil oil shows antimicrobial activity and can kill bacteria, yeast and mold that can lead to asthma and respiratory damage. (3, 4)\nRemedy: To fight inflammation and regulate the overreaction of the immune system when faced with an allergen, take one drop of basil oil internally by adding it to soup, salad dressing or any other dish. To support the respiratory system, dilute 2–3 drops of basil oil with equal parts coconut oil and apply topically to the chest, back of neck and temples.\n3. Eucalyptus Oil\nEucalyptus oil opens up the lungs and sinuses, thereby improving circulation and reducing symptoms of allergies. Studies have shown that it produces a cold sensation in the nose that helps to improve airflow. (5)\nEucalyptus contains citronellal, which has analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects; it also works as an expectorant, helping to cleanse the body of toxins and harmful microorganisms that are acting as allergens.\nA 2011 study published in Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine found that eucalyptus essential oil was an effective treatment for upper respiratory tract infections. Patients who were treated with eucalyptus spray reported an improvement in the severity of their most debilitating respiratory tract infection symptoms compared to participants in the placebo group. Improvement was defined as a reduction of sore throat, hoarseness or cough. (6)\nRemedy: To treat respiratory issues associated with allergies, diffuse five drops of eucalyptus at home or apply it topically to the chest and temples. To clear the nasal passages and relieve congestion, pour a cup of boiling water into a bowl and add 1–2 drops of eucalyptus essential oil. Then place a towel over your head and inhale deeply for 5–10 minutes.\n4. Lemon Oil\nLemon oil supports lymphatic system drainage and helps with overcoming respiratory conditions. Studies have shown that lemon essential oil inhibits the growth of bacteria and boosts the immune system. When diffused at home, lemon oil can kill bacteria and eliminate allergy triggers in the air. (7, 8)\nAdding 1–2 drops of lemon essential oil to water also helps with pH balance. Lemon water improves immune function and detoxifies the body. It stimulates the liver and flushes out toxins that can lead to inflammation and an overreactive immune system. Lemon water also stimulates white blood cell production, which is vital for immune system function because it helps to protect the body.\nLemon essential oil can also be used to disinfect your home, without depending on alcohol or bleach. It will remove bacteria and pollutants from your kitchen, bedroom and bathroom — reducing the triggers inside of your home and keeping the air clean for you and your family. This can be especially helpful as the seasons change and allergens from outside are being brought into your house on shoes and clothes.\nRemedy: Add lemon oil to your laundry detergent, mix a couple of drops with water and spray it on your couches, sheets, curtains and carpets.\n5. Tea Tree Oil\nThis powerful oil can destroy airborne pathogens that cause allergies. Diffusing tea tree oil in the home will kill mold, bacteria and fungi. It is an antiseptic agent and it has anti-inflammatory properties. Tea tree oil can be applied to the skin to kill bacteria and microorganisms; it can also be used as a household cleaner to disinfect the home and eliminate allergens. (9)\nA 2000 study conducted in Germany found that tea tree oil exhibits antimicrobial activity against a wide range of bacteria, yeasts and fungi. These microbes lead to inflammation and force our immune system to work on overdrive. (10)\nRemedy: Use tea tree oil on skin rashes and hives or as a household cleaner. When using tea tree topically, add 2–3 drops to a clean cotton ball and gently apply to the area of concern. For people with sensitive skin, dilute tea tree with a carrier oil first, like coconut or jojoba oil.\nHow to Use Essential Oils for Allergies\nFood Allergies — Take 1–2 drops of lemon or peppermint oil internally to relieve the symptoms of a food allergy. This will help to detoxify the body and eliminate the allergens through sweat or urination.\nSkin Rash & Hives — Use tea tree or basil oil topically to treat skin rashes and hives. Add 2–3 drops to a cotton ball and apply to the affected area. Layering oils over the liver area is another way to treat skin irritations because it helps the liver to flush out toxins that burden the skin. Dilute 3–4 drops of tea tree oil with coconut oil and rub it into the liver area.\nSeasonal Allergies — Disinfect your home with lemon and tea tree oil; this will eliminate triggers and cleanse the air and your furniture. Add 40 drops of lemon oil and 20 drops of tea tree oil to a 16-ounce spray bottle. Fill the bottle with pure water and a little bit of white vinegar and spray the mixture on any area in your home.\nTo reduce respiratory issues associated with seasonal allergies, try my Homemade Vapor Rub; it delivers a soothing feeling that will open up the airways and make it easier to breathe.\nAllergy Blend — Combine 2–3 drops of peppermint, eucalyptus and lavender oil with one teaspoon of coconut oil and massage the mixture into the temples, behind the ears and into the bottoms of the feet.\nPossible Side Effects\nWhen using these special essential oil for allergies, I don’t recommend that you take tea tree oil internally; it’s best to use tea tree aromatically or topically.

I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an' he gets sick.\" Of Mice and Men, John Steinbeck\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has brought new experiences to most of us, introducing extreme changes to our work and social life. Despite social distancing measures being necessary to curb the transmission of COVID-19, the emotional distress caused by social deprivation during lockdown has been tough. Increased loneliness has been reported amongst adults, as virtual alternatives like Zoom or FaceTime are just not the same. Moreover, loneliness has been linked to depression, a health concern officially recognised by the World Health Organization. Poor living conditions and lack of social interaction are associated with poor physical and mental health and higher mortality rates. From an evolutionary perspective, seeking social connections is a deeply-ingrained instinct, essential for survival throughout the animal kingdom. Social contact is associated with an increased life span for various species, such as honeybees, mice, and macaques. When we feel lonely, many of us experience higher levels of anxiety and hypervigilance, a defence mechanism thought to have evolved as a response to potential threats. But why does loneliness have such an effect on the body?\nThe effect of loneliness on the brain is poorly understood from a neuroscientific perspective. Positive social interactions such as smiling faces have been shown to activate neural reward systems. Lack of social interaction, on the other hand, is believed to create a 'craving for company' response in the midbrain, comparable to hunger states that trigger the search for food. Several neurotransmitters — chemical messengers important for communication between neurons — including dopamine, oxytocin, and opioid circuits, are thought to underlie the motivation for social reward. A study led by a research group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology suggested that a cluster of dopamine-related neurons found in the brainstem region, called the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), form part of a neural circuit representing the subjective experience of feeling lonely. The group showed that the DRN area was extremely sensitive to acute periods of social isolation just one day after mice were isolated from their cage companions. In the same study, the group used a technique called optogenetics to switch genetically modified neurons 'on' or 'off' using light. This increased or suppressed a loneliness-like state, respectively. Activation of DRN neurons increased social preference, making mice more sociable when re-introduced to peers. In primates, negative motivational states have been mainly observed in other areas of the brain, though the role of the DRN itself remains to be properly understood.\nWhile stress is fundamental to survival as it powers the 'fight-or-flight' response in dangerous situations, elevated levels of stress can be harmful to both the brain and the body. Stress causes the amygdala, the 'fear centre' of our brain, to contribute to the activation of our autonomic nervous system (ANS), alongside our central stress response system known as the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenocortical (HPA) axis. The interactions between the brain and adrenal glands in the HPA axis release cortisol, which helps our bodies deal with acute stress. However, chronic activation of the HPA can wreck havoc on our brains, increasing amygdala activity and causing atrophy in the hippocampus, a brain region responsible for learning and memory formation. Too much stress can remodel our brain by reducing the number of connections between neurons or shrinking the prefrontal cortex, which regulates cognitive functions such as decision making and concentration. These reactions may begin as appropriate responses to a stressful event, but set the stage for more serious conditions including clinical anxiety or major depression, leading to a vicious cycle between stress and mental health. Furthermore, chronic stress induces inflammation in the body, which can contribute to difficulty sleeping, digestive problems, or even a weakened immune system.\nThe stress from coping with social isolation and survival during the pandemic often reflects in poor sleep. They are tightly linked, as anxiety causes insomnia, which eventually increases anxiety itself. Research suggests lack of sleep contributes to loneliness and is a catalyst for social isolation. Sleep is more important for our brains than we may realise. On average, we spend around one third of our lives asleep. Sleep is essential for good mental and emotional health as well as adequate cognitive function. Restful sleep serves to 'reset' brain activity, to prepare us for emotional challenges the next day. Dreaming during REM sleep helps us process emotional experiences, like a form of nocturnal therapy. In the long term, sleep, including well-placed naps, helps our brain consolidate information and store memories.\nBrain activity after periods of sleep deprivation has been shown to be very similar to that observed in anxiety disorders. Poor sleep puts our brains on guard by triggering spikes in stress hormones early in the morning, and increases activity of the amygdala, which is also crucial for emotional processing and memory consolidation. Sleep deprivation has also been linked to changes within the medial prefrontal cortex and other brain regions associated with emotional control. People who sleep poorly are twice as likely to develop an anxiety disorder and other health problems such as increases in blood pressure, insulin resistance, and body weight. Some of these issues are linked to distinct changes in hunger-regulating hormones associated with sleep deprivation, such as higher levels of appetite-stimulating ghrelin or lower levels of satiety-inducing leptin. Furthermore, sleep restriction modifies our endocannabinoid levels, chemical signals that affect appetite and our reward system. Therefore, while poor sleep is a common and often underestimated outcome of altered stress levels, it can have other profound physical and psychological effects.\nCoping With Late Night Loneliness\nFor many, the peak of loneliness comes during the evening or at night. To combat this, smartphones and the Internet have offered an important means of connection during the pandemic. However, late night screen-usage is a disruptive behaviour, affecting not only our body clock but also the levels of melatonin, our 'sleeping hormone'. Therefore, minimising exposure to bright lights at night can facilitate good sleep. In addition, while a nightcap before bedtime might seem tempting to help quieten the hamster wheel going in your head, it is not a good sleep aid. Alcohol acts as a central nervous system depressant and disrupts sleep, especially in the second half of the night.\nSo, what can we do instead to calm our busy minds? Simple activities like reading a good book or just enjoying a cup of tea can help ease your thoughts. Alternatively, mindfulness is a more active way to better cope with pandemic loneliness and related sleeping issues. Mindfulness is like a workout for the brain — you practise awareness and concentration, resulting in general calmness and physical relaxation.\nWhile the pandemic has come with many challenges requiring adaptation of our daily lives, it has brought another opportunity to further help destigmatise stress and its related mental health issues, as we are all trying to stay sane in an insane world\nMirlinda Ademi is a third year PhD student in Clinical Neurosciences at Corpus Christi College.

If so, many people are aware of the risk factors and search for the magic pill that will stall or help prevent or reduce risk of Alzheimer's disease and any related dementias.\nDementia Potential Risk Factors\nWhat increases or decreases your chance of developing particular diseases as you age? These are risk factors that can be controlled or not. Uncontrollable factors are of course age, genes and their related changes. Subtle factors can also be race and gender, which is being widely studied.\nThe one thing most controllable are behavior and lifestyle. Researchers are not ready to say at this point that these two factors will definitely prevent these diseases, but there are promising results at this time.\nLearn How To Reduce the Risk Factors\nAs the number of older Americans are rising, the number of people with dementia is predicted to also rise. Studies have recently shown that new cases in a population have decreased in some locations. Observational studies have revealed factors such as healthy lifestyle behaviors and higher levels of education may be contributing to such a decline. But this cause and effect is uncertain. and need to be tested in a clinical trial to make further recommendations.\n\"A review of published research evaluated the evidence from clinical trials on behavior and lifestyle changes to prevent or delay Alzheimer's or age-related cognitive decline. The review found \"encouraging but inconclusive\" evidence for three types of behavioral changes (called interventions): physical activity, blood pressure control, and cognitive training. The findings mean that interventions in these areas are promising enough that researchers should keep studying them to learn more. Researchers continue to explore these and other interventions to determine whether — and in what amounts or forms — they might prevent dementia.\" From Alzheimers government website.\nWatch a video that highlights conclusions and recommendations from the research review published on the same site above.\nLeading a healthy lifestyle has not been a proven or effective way to prevent Alzheimers or dementia, but researchers are frantically seeking answers.

        "description": "Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting sounds very complicated and is a bit of a mouthful, but can be explained in a rather simple manner. Let’s say, on your usual route to work, there is some road work happening that causes on-coming traffic to pile-up and come to a stand-still. The traffic police block this road and create an alternate route for vehicles to get around, and this helps you and other commuters get to work easily. This is essentially what a coronary bypass surgery is. During your bypass procedure, the diseased sections of your coronary arteries are bypassed with healthy artery or vein grafts to increase blood flow to the heart muscle tissue. Bypass typically requires open-chest surgery. However, there are several newer, less invasive techniques for bypass surgery that can be used instead of open-chest surgery, in some cases.\nNot everyone with coronary artery disease needs bypass surgery. In some cases, an angioplasty procedure or even just lifestyle changes might be enough to treat heart diseases.\nBypass Surgery Risks\nWhile the amount of time and number of bypasses required may differ due to the severity of the blockages, there are usually a few risks associated with a bypass surgery, such as heart attack, stroke, too much bleeding, etc. Other risks include return of angina, problems from anesthesia and infections at the site of the chest incision. A few, particularly older people, suffer from memory loss and have trouble thinking clearly. However, these problems usually tend to improve over time.\nProcedure\nIn most cases, bypass surgery is an open-chest surgery. You’ll receive anesthesia before the surgery. During the surgery, your chest will be open and your heart exposed. The surgeon removes a healthy blood vessel—often from the leg—and attaches (grafts) it to the blocked artery. The new blood vessel bypasses the blocked artery to increase blood flow to the heart. You may have to stay in the hospital for at least 3 to 8 days after the surgery, followed by 4 to 6 weeks of recovery time at home.\nAdvancements in Bypass Surgery\nRecent advances in surgical techniques and equipment allow the surgeon to perform CABG in a less traumatic, “minimally invasive” manner. Minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS) may include a smaller incision or may avoid the use of a heart-lung machine, or both. Pioneering work is also being done to develop techniques that will allow surgeons to perform beating-heart bypass procedures through “keyhole” incisions. This technique requires special equipment and the heart keeps on pumping blood for the body.\nLife after Bypass Surgery\nThe success of a bypass surgery also depends on you. You will need to stop smoking, eat right and get regular exercise after your surgery. These changes will help your bypass grafts last and stay open longer. They will also give you the best chance of living a longer, healthier life. If you are taking medicines for angina, lowering cholesterol, or to control blood pressure, be sure to take these every day or as per your doctor’s prescription.\nCoronary Artery Bypass Grafting is a serious and life-altering procedure.

Numerous independent science academies and regulatory bodies have reviewed the evidence about risks, concluding that commercialized GM crops are safe for human consumption and the environment [5]–[7]. There are also plenty of studies showing that GM crops cause benefits in terms of higher yields and cost savings in agricultural production [8]–[12], and welfare gains among adopting farm households [13]–[15]. However, some argue that the evidence about impacts is mixed and that studies showing large benefits may have problems with the data and methods used [16]–[18]. Uncertainty about GM crop impacts is one reason for the widespread public suspicion towards this technology. We have carried out a meta-analysis that may help to consolidate the evidence.\nWhile earlier reviews of GM crop impacts exist [19]–[22], our approach adds to the knowledge in two important ways. First, we include more recent studies into the meta-analysis. In the emerging literature on GM crop impacts, new studies are published continuously, broadening the geographical area covered, the methods used, and the type of outcome variables considered. For instance, in addition to other impacts we analyze effects of GM crop adoption on pesticide quantity, which previous meta-analyses could not because of the limited number of observations for this particular outcome variable. Second, we go beyond average impacts and use meta-regressions to explain impact heterogeneity and test for possible biases.\nOur meta-analysis concentrates on the most important GM crops, including herbicide-tolerant (HT) soybean, maize, and cotton, as well as insect-resistant (IR) maize and cotton. For these crops, a sufficiently large number of original impact studies have been published to estimate meaningful average effect sizes. We estimate mean impacts of GM crop adoption on crop yield, pesticide quantity, pesticide cost, total production cost, and farmer profit. Furthermore, we analyze several factors that may influence outcomes, such as geographic location, modified crop trait, and type of data and methods used in the original studies.\nMaterials and Methods\nLiterature search\nOriginal studies for inclusion in this meta-analysis were identified through keyword searches in relevant literature databanks. Studies were searched in the ISI Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, EconLit, and AgEcon Search. We searched for studies in the English language that were published after 1995. We did not extend the review to earlier years, because the commercial adoption of GM crops started only in the mid-1990s [23]. The search was performed for combinations of keywords related to GM technology and related to the outcome of interest. Concrete keywords used related to GM technology were (an asterisk is a replacement for any ending of the respective term; quotation marks indicate that the term was used as a whole, not each word alone): GM*, “genetically engineered”, “genetically modified”, transgenic, “agricultural biotechnology”, HT, “herbicide tolerant”, Roundup, Bt, “insect resistant”. Concrete keywords used related to outcome variables were: impact*, effect*, benefit*, yield*, economic*, income*, cost*, soci*, pesticide*, herbicide*, insecticide*, productivity*, margin*, profit*. The search was completed in March 2014.\nMost of the publications in the ISI Web of Knowledge are articles in academic journals, while Google Scholar, EconLit, and AgEcon Search also comprise book chapters and grey literature such as conference papers, working papers, and reports in institutional series. Articles published in academic journals have usually passed a rigorous peer-review process. Most papers presented at academic conferences have also passed a peer-review process, which is often less strict than that of good journals though. Some of the other publications are peer reviewed, while many are not. Some of the working papers and reports are published by research institutes or government organizations, while others are NGO publications. Unlike previous reviews of GM crop impacts, we did not limit the sample to peer-reviewed studies but included all publications for two reasons. First, a clear-cut distinction between studies with and without peer review is not always possible, especially when dealing with papers that were not published in a journal or presented at an academic conference [24]. Second, studies without peer review also influence the public and policy debate on GM crops; ignoring them completely would be short-sighted.\nOf the studies identified through the keyword searches, not all reported original impact results. We classified studies by screening titles, abstracts, and full texts. Studies had to fulfill the following criteria to be included:\nThe study is an empirical investigation of the agronomic and/or economic impacts of GM soybean, GM maize, or GM cotton using micro-level data from individual plots and/or farms. Other GM crops such as GM rapeseed, GM sugarbeet, and GM papaya were commercialized in selected countries [23], but the number of impact studies available for these other crops is very small.\nThe study reports GM crop impacts in terms of one or more of the following outcome variables: yield, pesticide quantity (especially insecticides and herbicides), pesticide costs, total variable costs, gross margins, farmer profits. If only the number of pesticide sprays was reported, this was used as a proxy for pesticide quantity.\nThe study analyzes the performance of GM crops by either reporting mean outcomes for GM and non-GM, absolute or percentage differences, or estimated coefficients of regression models that can be used to calculate percentage differences between GM and non-GM crops.\nThe study contains original results and is not only a review of previous studies.\nIn some cases, the same results were reported in different publications; in these cases, only one of the publications was included to avoid double counting. On the other hand, several publications involve more than one impact observation, even for a single outcome variable, for instance when reporting results for different geographical regions or derived with different methods (e.g., comparison of mean outcomes of GM and non-GM crops plus regression model estimates). In those cases, all observations were included. Moreover, the same primary dataset was sometimes used for different publications without reporting identical results (e.g., analysis of different outcome variables, different waves of panel data, use of different methods). Hence, the number of impact observations in our sample is larger than the number of publications and primary datasets (Data S1). The number of studies selected at various stages is shown in the flow diagram in Figure 1. The number of publications finally included in the meta-analysis is 147 (Table S1).\nDownload:\nPPT\nPowerPoint slide\nPNG\nlarger image\nTIFF\noriginal image\nFigure 1. Selection of studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629.g001\nEffect sizes and influencing factors\nEffect sizes are measures of outcome variables. We chose the percentage difference between GM and non-GM crops for five different outcome variables, namely yield, pesticide quantity, pesticide cost, total production cost, and farmer profits per unit area. Most studies that analyze production costs focus on variable costs, which are the costs primarily affected through GM technology adoption. Accordingly, profits are calculated as revenues minus variable production costs (profits calculated in this way are also referred to as gross margins). These production costs also take into account the higher prices charged by private companies for GM seeds. Hence, the percentage differences in profits considered here are net economic benefits for farmers using GM technology. Percentage differences, when not reported in the original studies, were calculated from mean value comparisons between GM and non-GM or from estimated regression coefficients.\nSince we look at different types of GM technologies (different modified traits) that are used in different countries and regions, we do not expect that effect sizes are homogenous across studies. Hence, our approach of combining effect sizes corresponds to a random-effects model in meta-analysis [25]. To explain impact heterogeneity and test for possible biases, we also compiled data on a number of study descriptors that may influence the reported effect sizes. These influencing factors include information on the type of GM technology (modified trait), the region studied, the type of data and method used, the source of funding, and the type of publication. All influencing factors are defined as dummy variables. The exact definition of these dummy variables is given in Table 1. Variable distributions of the study descriptors are shown in Table S2.\nDownload:\nPPT\nPowerPoint slide\nPNG\nlarger image\nTIFF\noriginal image\nTable 1. Variables used to analyze influencing factors of GM crop impacts.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629.t001\nStatistical analysis\nIn a first step, we estimate average effect sizes for each outcome variable. To test whether these mean impacts are significantly different from zero, we regress each outcome variable on a constant with cluster correction of standard errors by primary dataset. Thus, the test for significance is valid also when observations from the same dataset are correlated. We estimate average effect sizes for all GM crops combined. However, we expect that the results may differ by modified trait, so that we also analyze mean effects for HT crops and IR crops separately.\nMeta-analyses often weight impact estimates by their variances; estimates with low variance are considered more reliable and receive a higher weight [26]. In our case, several of the original studies do not report measures of variance, so that weighting by variance is not possible. Alternatively, weighting by sample size is common, but sample sizes are also not reported in all studies considered, especially not in some of the grey literature publications. To test the robustness of the results, we employ a different weighting procedure, using the inverse of the number of impact observations per dataset as weights. This procedure avoids that individual datasets that were used in several publications dominate the calculation of average effect sizes.\nIn a second step, we use meta-regressions to explain impact heterogeneity and test for possible biases. Linear regression models are estimated separately for all of the five outcome variables: is the effect size (percentage difference between GM and non-GM) of each outcome variable h for observation i in publication j, and is a vector of influencing factors. is a coefficient and a vector of coefficients to be estimated; is a random error term. Influencing factors used in the regressions are defined in Table 1.\nResults and Discussion\nAverage effect sizes\nDistributions of all five outcome variables are shown in Figure S1. Table 2 presents unweighted mean impacts. As a robustness check, we weighted by the inverse of the number of impact observations per dataset. Comparing unweighted results (Table 2) with weighted results (Table S3) we find only very small differences. This comparison suggests that the unweighted results are robust.\nDownload:\nPPT\nPowerPoint slide\nPNG\nlarger image\nTIFF\noriginal image\nTable 2. Impacts of GM crop adoption by modified trait.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629.t002\nOn average, GM technology has increased crop yields by 21% (Figure 2). These yield increases are not due to higher genetic yield potential, but to more effective pest control and thus lower crop damage [27]. At the same time, GM crops have reduced pesticide quantity by 37% and pesticide cost by 39%. The effect on the cost of production is not significant. GM seeds are more expensive than non-GM seeds, but the additional seed costs are compensated through savings in chemical and mechanical pest control. Average profit gains for GM-adopting farmers are 69%.\nDownload:\nPPT\nPowerPoint slide\nPNG\nlarger image\nTIFF\noriginal image\nFigure 2. Impacts of GM crop adoption.\nAverage percentage differences between GM and non-GM crops are shown. Results refer to all GM crops, including herbicide-tolerant and insect-resistant traits. The number of observations varies by outcome variable; yield: 451; pesticide quantity: 121; pesticide cost: 193; total production cost: 115; farmer profit: 136. *** indicates statistical significance at the 1% level.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629.g002\nResults of Cochran’s test [25], which are reported in Figure S1, confirm that there is significant heterogeneity across study observations for all five outcome variables. Hence it is useful to further disaggregate the results. Table 2 shows a breakdown by modified crop trait. While significant reductions in pesticide costs are observed for both HT and IR crops, only IR crops cause a consistent reduction in pesticide quantity. Such disparities are expected, because the two technologies are quite different. IR crops protect themselves against certain insect pests, so that spraying can be reduced. HT crops, on the other hand, are not protected against pests but against a broad-spectrum chemical herbicide (mostly glyphosate), use of which facilitates weed control. While HT crops have reduced herbicide quantity in some situations, they have contributed to increases in the use of broad-spectrum herbicides elsewhere [2], [11], [19]. The savings in pesticide costs for HT crops in spite of higher quantities can be explained by the fact that broad-spectrum herbicides are often much cheaper than the selective herbicides that were used before. The average farmer profit effect for HT crops is large and positive, but not statistically significant because of considerable variation and a relatively small number of observations for this outcome variable.\nImpact heterogeneity and possible biases\nTable 3 shows the estimation results from the meta-regressions that explain how different factors influence impact heterogeneity. Controlling for other factors, yield gains of IR crops are almost 7 percentage points higher than those of HT crops (column 1). Furthermore, yield gains of GM crops are 14 percentage points higher in developing countries than in developed countries. Especially smallholder farmers in the tropics and subtropics suffer from considerable pest damage that can be reduced through GM crop adoption [27].\nDownload:\nPPT\nPowerPoint slide\nPNG\nlarger image\nTIFF\noriginal image\nTable 3. Factors influencing results on GM crop impacts (%).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629.t003\nMost original studies in this meta-analysis build on farm surveys, although some are based on field-trial data. Field-trial results are often criticized to overestimate impacts, because farmers may not be able to replicate experimental conditions. However, results in Table 3 (column 1) show that field-trial data do not overestimate the yield effects of GM crops. Reported yield gains from field trials are even lower than those from farm surveys. This is plausible, because pest damage in non-GM crops is often more severe in farmers’ fields than on well-managed experimental plots.\nAnother concern often voiced in the public debate is that studies funded by industry money might report inflated benefits. Our results show that the source of funding does not significantly influence the impact estimates. We also analyzed whether the statistical method plays a role. Many of the earlier studies just compared yields of GM and non-GM crops without considering possible differences in other inputs and conditions that may also affect the outcome. Net impacts of GM technology can be estimated with regression-based production function models that control for other factors. Interestingly, results derived from regression analysis report higher average yield effects.\nFinally, we examined whether the type of publication matters. Controlling for other factors, the regression coefficient for journal publications in column (1) of Table 3 implies that studies published in peer-reviewed journals show 12 percentage points higher yield gains than studies published elsewhere. Indeed, when only including observations from studies that were published in journals, the mean effect size is larger than if all observations are included (Figure S2). On first sight, one might suspect publication bias, meaning that only studies that report substantial effects are accepted for publication in a journal. A common way to assess possible publication bias in meta-analysis is through funnel plots [25], which we show in Figure S3. However, in our case these funnel plots should not be over-interpreted. First, only studies that report variance measures can be included in the funnel plots, which holds true only for a subset of the original studies used here. Second, even if there were publication bias, our mean results would be estimated correctly, because we do include studies that were not published in peer-reviewed journals.\nFurther analysis suggests that the journal review process does not systematically filter out studies with small effect sizes. The journal articles in the sample report a wide range of yield effects, even including negative estimates in some cases. Moreover, when combining journal articles with papers presented at academic conferences, average yield gains are even higher (Table 3, column 2). Studies that were neither published in a journal nor presented at an academic conference encompass a diverse set of papers, including reports by NGOs and outspoken biotechnology critics. These reports show lower GM yield effects on average, but not all meet common scientific standards. Hence, rather than indicating publication bias, the positive and significant journal coefficient may be the result of a negative NGO bias in some of the grey literature.\nConcerning other outcome variables, IR crops have much stronger reducing effects on pesticide quantity than HT crops (Table 3, column 3), as already discussed above. In terms of pesticide costs, the difference between IR and HT is less pronounced and not statistically significant (column 4). The profit gains of GM crops are 60 percentage points higher in developing countries than in developed countries (column 6). This large difference is due to higher GM yield gains and stronger pesticide cost savings in developing countries. Moreover, most GM crops are not patented in developing countries, so that GM seed prices are lower [19]. Like for yields, studies published in peer-reviewed journals report higher profit gains than studies published elsewhere, but again we do not find evidence of publication bias (column 7).\nConclusion\nThis meta-analysis confirms that – in spite of impact heterogeneity – the average agronomic and economic benefits of GM crops are large and significant. Impacts vary especially by modified crop trait and geographic region. Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for IR crops than for HT crops. Yield and farmer profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries. Recent impact studies used better data and methods than earlier studies, but these improvements in study design did not reduce the estimates of GM crop advantages. Rather, NGO reports and other publications without scientific peer review seem to bias the impact estimates downward. But even with such biased estimates included, mean effects remain sizeable.\nOne limitation is that not all of the original studies included in this meta-analysis reported sample sizes and measures of variance. This is not untypical for analyses in the social sciences, especially when studies from the grey literature are also included. Future impact studies with primary data should follow more standardized reporting procedures. Nevertheless, our findings reveal that there is robust evidence of GM crop benefits. Such evidence may help to gradually increase public trust in this promising technology.\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1.\nHistograms of effect sizes for the five outcome variables.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629.s001\n(PDF)\nFigure S2.\nImpacts of GM crop adoption including only studies published in journals.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629.s002\n(PDF)\nFigure S3.\nFunnel plots for the five outcome variables.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629.s003\n(PDF)\nTable S1.\nList of publications included in the meta-analysis.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629.s004\n(PDF)\nTable S2.\nDistribution of study descriptor dummy variables for different outcomes.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629.s005\n(PDF)\nTable S3.\nWeighted mean impacts of GM crop adoption.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629.s006\n(PDF)\nData S1.\nData used for the meta-analysis.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0111629.s007\n(PDF)\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Sinja Buri and Tingting Xu for assistance in compiling the dataset.

Schwimmer, Appellees.\nBefore CLEVENGER, RADER and GAJARSA, Circuit Judges. Roger L. Browdy, Browdy and Neimark, P.L.L.C, of Washington, DC, argued for appellant. David S. Abrams, Roylance, Abrams, Berdo & Goodman, L.L.P., of Washington, DC, argued for appellee. With him on the brief was Robert H. Berdo.\nDavid M. Rapoport (\"Rapoport\") appeals from a final decision of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"Board\") dated February 29, 2000. The real parties in interest in this interference are: (1) New York University (\"NYU\"), assignee of Rapoport; (2) the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University (\"Stanford\"), assignee of William C. Dement (\"Dement\") and Mark R. Rosekind (\"Rosekind\"); and (3) the Bristol Myers Squibb Company (\"Bristol Myers\"), assignee of Jeffrey L. Schwimmer (\"Schwimmer\"). Collectively, Dement, Rosekind, and Schwimmer will be referred to herein as \"Dement et al.\"\nThe Board awarded judgment of priority as to the sole count of the interference in favor of Dement et al., and further ordered that Dement et al. are entitled to a patent containing claims 1-13 of U.S. Patent Application No. 07/695,325 (\"the ′325 application\"), filed May 3, 1991, and that Rapoport is not entitled to a patent containing claims 1-12 of U.S. Patent Application No. 07/479,693 (\"the ′693 application\"), filed February 14, 1990. We affirm.\nThe count in this interference relates to the treatment of sleep apnea by administering a therapeutically effective amount of certain azapirone compounds such as buspirone \"to a patient in need of such treatment.\"\nOn February 12, 1990, Schwimmer filed U.S. Patent Application No. 07/478,820 (\"the ′820 application\"). Claim 1 of the ′820 application as originally filed reads in relevant part:\n1. A method for treatment of sleep apneas comprising administration of a therapeutically effective regimen of a Formula I azapirone compound or a pharmaceutically effective acid addition salt thereof to a patient in need of such treatment․\nThere is no dispute that although buspirone is an azapirone compound, the azapirone compounds of Schwimmer's Formula I exclude buspirone. On the same day, Dement, Rosekind, and Schwimmer jointly filed U.S. Patent Application No. 07/479,803 (\"the ′803 application\"). Original claim 1 of the ′803 application reads as follows in its entirety:\n1. A method for treatment of sleep apneas comprising administration of a therapeutically effective regimen of buspirone or a pharmaceutically effective acid addition salt thereof to a patient in need of such treatment.\nTwo days later, on February 14, 1990, Rapoport filed the ′693 application. Claim 1 of the ′693 application reads as follows in relevant part:\nThe azapirone compounds of Rapoport's Formula I include buspirone, and claim 6 of Rapoport's ′693 application is specifically directed to buspirone.\nOn February 12, 1991, Schwimmer filed U.S. Patent Application No. 07/657,332 (\"the ′332 application\") as a continuation of the ′820 application, and on May 3, 1991, Dement, Rosekind, and Schwimmer jointly filed the ′325 application as a continuation-in-part of the ′803 and ′332 applications. Original claim 1 of the ′325 application reads as follows in relevant part:\n1. A method for treatment of sleep apneas comprising administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a Formula I azapirone compound or a pharmaceutically effective acid addition salt thereof to a patient in need of such treatment․\nThe azapirone compounds of Formula I in the context of the ′325 application include buspirone, and claim 7 of the ′325 application is specifically directed to buspirone.\nOn January 10, 1992, an interference was declared, and Dement et al. were accorded the benefit of the February 12, 1990, filing date of the ′820 and ′803 parent applications and therefore designated as the senior party. Count 1 of the interference, the only count at issue, reads in pertinent part as follows:\nA method for treatment of sleep apneas comprising administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a Formula I azapirone compound or a pharmaceutically effective acid addition salt thereof to a patient in need of such treatment․\nThe azapirone compounds of Formula I in the context of the interference count include buspirone. Claims 1-12 of Rapoport's ′693 application and claims 1-13 of the Dement et al. ′325 application correspond to the count.\nOn June 10, 1992, Rapoport filed a Motion for Judgment pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 1.633(a) in which he argued, inter alia, that the subject matter of the count was not patentable to Dement et al., on the grounds that it was anticipated and/or rendered obvious pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 102(a) and/or 35 U.S.C. § 103 by a prior art reference authored by Rapoport. This reference, entitled \"Buspirone: Anxiolytic Therapy with Respiratory Implications,\" was published in Family Practice Recertification in September 1989, at pages 32-37 of Vol. 11, No. 9 (Supplement) (\"the FPR Publication\"). We note that the FPR Publication does not constitute a statutory bar against either Dement et al. or Rapoport, since it was published less than one year before the priority filing date of the ′325 and ′693 applications. 35 U.S.C. §§ 102(a) and 102(b) (1994). However, because the FPR Publication was authored by Rapoport, it can be cited as prior art against Dement et al., but not against Rapoport. 35 U.S.C. § 102 (1994); In re Katz, 687 F.2d 450, 454, 215 USPQ 14, 17 (CCPA 1982). Dement et al. do not contest the fact that the FPR Publication is a prior art reference that may be cited against them in this interference.\nOn October 29, 1992, pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 1.602(b), Dement and Rosekind disclosed that they were obligated to assign their rights in the ′325 application to Stanford, and Schwimmer disclosed that he was obligated to assign his rights to Bristol Myers. Approximately eight months later, on June 21, 1993, Dement et al. explicitly stated on the record that Schwimmer was the sole inventor of the use of most of the azapirone compounds covered by the count except for buspirone in the treatment of sleep apnea. On July 9, 1993, Rapoport filed a Second Motion to Accept Belated Filing Of Preliminary Motion Under 37 C.F.R. § 1.633(a) (\"Rapoport's Motion to Accept Belated Filing\"), along with a Motion for Judgment Under C.F.R. § 1.633(a) ( \"Rapoport's Belated Motion for Judgment\") arguing that claims in the Dement et al. ′325 application are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C. § 102(g) and/or § 103 over the prior invention of claims 7 and 13 of Dr. Dement, which were invented by a different inventive entity.\nOn April 12, 1996, the Board rendered a decision which, inter alia, denied Rapoport's June 10, 1992, Motion for Judgment, denied Rapoport's Motion To Accept Belated Filing, and dismissed Rapoport's Belated Motion for Judgment as being untimely. These decisions were adhered to in a decision for reconsideration dated September 6, 1996. The Board rendered its final decision on February 29, 2000.\nIn its decision dated April 12, 1996, the Board found that: (1) Rapoport had established a conception date of May 13, 1988; (2) Dement was entitled to a 1986 date of conception; and (3) the conception by Dement inures to the benefit of Dement et al. pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 116. Based on these findings, the Board awarded priority of the invention of the interference count to Dement et al. Before this court, Rapoport does not contest either the ultimate priority determination in favor of Dement et al. or the underlying findings by the Board.\nInstead, on appeal, Rapoport argues that the Board erred in not finding that all of the Dement et al. claims corresponding to the count are either anticipated by the FPR Publication or rendered obvious by the FPR Publication in combination with admissions allegedly made in the Dement et al. ′325 application. Rapoport also argues that it was an abuse of discretion for the Board to deny Rapoport's Motion to Accept Belated Filing and to dismiss Rapoport's Belated Motion for Judgment as being untimely. Finally, Rapoport argues that-in the event that this court finds that all of the Dement et al. claims are unpatentable in view of the FPR Publication-the Board erred in awarding judgment on priority in favor of Dement et al. We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1295(a)(4)(A) (1994) and 35 U.S.C. § 141 (1994).\nTo anticipate a claim, a prior art reference must disclose every limitation of the claimed invention, either expressly or inherently. In re Schreiber, 128 F.3d 1473, 1477, 44 USPQ2d 1429, 1431 (Fed.Cir.1997). Anticipation is a question of fact, and we uphold decisions of the Board on factual matters if there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board's findings. In re Hyatt, 211 F.3d 1367, 1371-72, 54 USPQ2d 1664, 1667 (Fed.Cir.2000). Whether a claim limitation is inherent in a prior art reference is a factual issue on which evidence may be introduced. In re Schreiber, 128 F.3d at 1477, 44 USPQ2d at 1431. The Board's determination of obviousness is a question of law subject to de novo review. However, the Board's factual determinations underlying its rulings on anticipation and obviousness are reviewed under the substantial evidence test. Dickinson v. Zurko, 527 U.S. 150, 119 S.Ct. 1816, 144 L.Ed.2d 143, 50 USPQ2d 1930 (1999); In re Gartside, 203 F.3d 1305, 1316, 53 USPQ2d 1769, 1775-76 (Fed.Cir.2000). Substantial evidence is \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\" In re Gartside, 203 F.3d at 1312, 53 USPQ2d at 1773 (quoting Consol. Edison Co. v. NLRB, 305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)).\nThe Board's decisions to deny Rapoport's Motion to Accept Belated Filing and to dismiss Rapoport's Belated Motion for Judgment are reviewed for abuse of discretion. Abrutyn v. Giovanniello, 15 F.3d 1048, 1050-51, 29 USPQ2d 1615, 1617 (Fed.Cir.1994). An abuse of discretion occurs if the decision (1) is clearly unreasonable, arbitrary, or fanciful; (2) is based on an erroneous conclusion of law; (3) rests on clearly erroneous fact finding; or (4) involves a record that contains no evidence on which the Board could rationally base its decision. Id.\nAs noted above, Rapoport has not requested review of the underlying factual determinations or of the legal bases for the Board's award of priority to Dement et al. Instead, Rapoport merely questions the Board's action of awarding priority to Dement et al. at the same time as holding the Dement et al. claims patentable. This issue involves the Board's legal conclusions regarding priority, conception, and reduction to practice, which we review de novo. Eaton v. Evans, 204 F.3d 1094, 1097, 53 USPQ2d 1696, 1698 (Fed.Cir.2000).\nWe first address Rapoport's argument that the Dement et al. claims corresponding to the count are anticipated by the FPR Publication. Because the first step of a patentability or invalidity analysis based on anticipation and/or obviousness in view of prior art references is no different from that of an infringement analysis, we must start by interpreting any disputed terms in the interference count. Amazon.com, Inc. v. Barnesandnoble.com, Inc., 239 F.3d 1343, 1351, 57 USPQ2d 1747, 1751-52 (Fed.Cir.2001). Only when a claim is properly understood can a determination be made whether the claim \"reads on\" an accused device or method, or whether the prior art anticipates and/or renders obvious the claimed invention. Id.\nRapoport argues on appeal, as he did before the Board, that it is reasonable to interpret the phrase \"method for treatment of sleep apneas\" in the interference count broadly to include both (1) treatment of anxiety secondary to sleep apnea and (2) treatment of the underlying sleep disorder itself. In contrast, Dement et al. agree with the Board, which found that in the context of the present interference, treatment of the underlying sleep apnea disorder itself is distinct from treatment of anxiety and other secondary symptoms related to sleep apnea. Based on this finding, the Board interpreted the term \"treatment of sleep apneas\" in the interference count as being limited to treatment of the underlying sleep apnea disorder itself. We review the Board's legal conclusion, as we do all rulings on claim interpretation, without deference. Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., 138 F.3d 1448, 1456, 46 USPQ2d 1169, 1174-75 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc); Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc., 52 F.3d 967, 979, 34 USPQ2d 1321, 1329 (Fed.Cir.1995) (en banc), aff'd, 517 U.S. 370, 116 S.Ct. 1384, 134 L.Ed.2d 577, 38 USPQ2d 1461 (1996). Upon reviewing the record, we discern no error with the Board's interpretation.\nFirst, we note that the disputed phrase \"treatment of sleep apneas\" is technically part of the preamble of the interference count, because it appears before the transition word \"comprising.\" However, there is no dispute in this case that the phrase should be treated as a claim limitation. Moreover, without treating the phrase \"treatment of sleep apneas\" as a claim limitation, the phrase \"to a patient in need of such treatment\" would not have a proper antecedent basis.\nIn support of his proposed broad interpretation for \"treatment of sleep apneas,\" Rapoport relies on the following passage from the written description of the Dement et al. ′325 application:\nAccording to Rapoport, this passage supports the notion that \"treatment of sleep apneas\" in the interference count should include both treatment of the underlying disorder and the \"symptomatology associated with the occurrence of sleep apneas.\" However, to the extent that the above passage suggests that \"alleviation of the symptomatology associated with the occurrence of sleep apneas\" constitutes an aspect of the use of azapirones in treating sleep apneas, the intrinsic record in this case leads to the conclusion that \"treatment of sleep apneas\" refers only to treatment of the underlying sleep apnea disorder.\nFirst, the plain language of the interference count unambiguously refers to \"treatment of sleep apneas\" narrowly defined, and does not also include by its plain terms \"treatment of symptoms associated with sleep apneas.\" See Davis v. Loesch, 998 F.2d 963, 968, 27 USPQ2d 1440, 1444 (Fed.Cir.1993) ( \"Interference counts are given the broadest reasonable interpretation possible, and resort to the specification is necessary only when there are ambiguities inherent in the claim language or obvious from arguments of counsel.\") (citations omitted); In re Hyatt, 211 F.3d at 1372, 54 USPQ2d at 1667 (during examination proceedings, claims are given their broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification). Here, Rapoport relies on the written description of the Dement et al. ′325 application in an unsuccessful attempt to broaden the phrase \"treatment of sleep apneas\" from its ordinary meaning, which narrowly refers to treatment of the underlying disorder itself.\nContrary to Rapoport's assertions, the written description of the Dement et al. ′325 application actually confirms the Board's interpretation, and explicitly defines \"sleep apneas\":\nIn the context of this invention, sleep apneas comprise all the sub-categories such as those caused by upper airway obstruction; those whose origins arise in the central nervous system; and those of a mixed type with contribution from both components.\nThis passage indicates that the term \"treatment of sleep apneas\" refers to reducing or eliminating sleep apneas caused by upper airway obstructions, sleep apneas whose origins arise in the central nervous system, and sleep apneas of a mixed type.\nAs further support for the Board's position, the Summary of the Invention in the Dement et al. ′325 application states that \"[f]or use in the instant method oral administration of a dose of from about 10 to 60 mg of an azapirone at the hour of sleep is usually employed.\" This description is consistent with treatment of the underlying sleep apnea disorder, which by definition manifests itself during sleep, and inconsistent with treatment of anxiety and other symptoms commonly associated with sleep apnea, which would obviously manifest themselves while a patient is awake.\nNext, in a portion of the Detailed Description of the Invention not limited to any particular embodiment, the Dement et al. ′325 application states as follows:\n[T]he present invention concerns a method for treating sleep apneas comprising obstructive, central and mixed apneas, in a patient population that ranges from infants to geriatric-aged individuals.\nOnce again, this passage defines sleep apneas in terms of the underlying respiratory disorder and uses the term \"treating sleep apneas\" in a manner that is consistent with the Board's interpretation.\nFinally, when describing the effectiveness of the sleep apnea treatment method that is disclosed and claimed in the Dement et al. ′325 application, the discussion is limited to the treatment's effect on the underlying sleep apnea disorder, and does not mention the treatment's effect on the associated symptomatology:\nIn other words, Dement et al. noted that treating patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea with buspirone at bedtime had a measurably beneficial effect on the underlying sleep apnea disorder (i.e., increased sleep efficiency, gain in total sleep time, significant reduction in episodes of sleep disturbance, and improved respiratory efficiency). However, Dement et al. made no mention in the written description of the ′325 application of specific evidence of the treatment's effect on the symptomatology commonly associated with sleep apnea.\nWe therefore conclude that the Board was correct in interpreting \"treatment of sleep apneas\" as being limited to treatment of the underlying sleep apnea disorder, i.e., reducing the frequency and severity of the apnea episodes during sleep.\nHaving construed the disputed term in the interference count and affirmed the Board's interpretation, we can properly address the merits of Rapoport's anticipation argument. The Board found that the disclosure of the FPR Publication was limited to treatment of anxiety in patients suffering from sleep apnea with buspirone, and did not address treatment of the underlying sleep apnea disorder. What a reference teaches is a question of fact. In re Beattie, 974 F.2d 1309, 1311, 24 USPQ2d 1040, 1041-42 (Fed.Cir.1992). Therefore, we review the Board's characterization of the disclosure in the FPR Publication for substantial evidence. In re Gartside, 203 F.3d at 1316, 53 USPQ2d at 1775-76. The record indicates that substantial evidence supports the Board's factual findings regarding the FPR Publication.\nThere is no disclosure in the FPR Publication of tests in which buspirone is administered to patients suffering from sleep apnea with the intent to cure the underlying condition. As the Board correctly found, the FPR Publication focuses on the treatment of anxiety with buspirone, and indicates that buspirone has potential as a primary treatment for dyspnea (which simply refers to difficulty in breathing in general).\nFor example, a passage in the FPR Publication mentions the possibility of administering buspirone to patents suffering from sleep apnea, but this is for the purpose of treating anxiety in such patients, not for the purpose of treating the sleep apnea disorder itself:\nBuspirone thus appears to be an anxiolytic agent with a profile of respiratory effects that make it potentially safer to use for patients with impaired respiratory function and for patients with diseases such as obstructive sleep apnea, when use of ventilatory depressants would be clearly dangerous.\nRapoport concedes as much:\nWhile this passage does not disclose administering buspirone with the intent of treating the sleep apnea per se, such an explicit intent is not necessary in order to anticipate the claims of Dement corresponding to the count.\nRapoport Opening Brief before the Board filed July 5, 1994. In a nutshell, using Rapoport's own words from its Opening Brief before the Board, Rapoport's theory on anticipation is as follows:\nAs long as one administers buspirone to a patient with sleep apnea in a therapeutically effective amount, at least claims 1, 2, 6 and 7 of the Dement et al [sic] application underlying the present proceeding are fully anticipated.\nIn other words, according to Rapoport, neither the reasons for administering buspirone to the patient nor the time of administration are relevant. Instead, according to Rapoport, the only requirement of the count is that the patient suffer from sleep apnea. Given our disagreement with Rapoport's proposed claim interpretation, this argument cannot succeed.\nMoreover, the need for tests to confirm safety for treating anxiety in patients with sleep apnea is indicated in the very next sentence of the FPR Publication relating to treating patients suffering from anxiety: \"The preliminary results found among healthy subjects need to be confirmed by directly testing patients who need anxiolytic therapy.\" Thus, even the proposed testing in the FPR Publication is limited to the treatment of patients suffering from anxiety, not from sleep apnea. Moreover, the lack of information concerning administration of buspirone to patients while sleeping is indicated in Table 3 of the FPR Publication, where the entry under \"Buspirone\" regarding its effect on upper airway tone during sleep is \"Undetermined.\"\nThe Board also correctly found that the FPR Publication does not show administering buspirone in any specific amounts to patients suffering from sleep apnea. Rather, the FPR Publication discloses administering single oral doses of 10 mg to nine normal volunteers. It also discloses administering buspirone in an amount of 10 mg three times a day to two patients with \"severe alveolar hypoventilation\" who needed anxiolytic therapy to facilitate use of a nocturnal ventilator. There is no dispute that none of these patients are reported as suffering from sleep apnea in the FPR Publication.\nIn contrast, as mentioned earlier, the Dement et al. ′325 application discloses that based on clinical experience, administration of a single dose of buspirone at bedtime to patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea resulted in a marked reduction in episodes of sleep disturbance, and further discloses administration of 20-40 mg of buspirone at the hour of sleep to an average adult.\nWe note that there is no mention in the FRP Publication of administering buspirone to a patient at bedtime. The significance of this fact, of course, is that sleep apnea, by definition, occurs during sleep. In one of the two tests mentioned in the FPR Publication, a single 10 mg dosage was given at an unspecified time, while in the second test buspirone was administered in doses of 10 mg three times a day, once again without specifying administering the buspirone at bedtime.\nFinally, we note that Rapoport argues that the FPR Publication inherently anticipates the count even under the Board's claim interpretation. See In re Graves, 69 F.3d 1147, 1152, 36 USPQ2d 1697, 1701 (Fed.Cir.1995) (noting that a reference anticipates a claim if it discloses the claimed invention such that a skilled artisan could take the teachings of the reference in combination with his own knowledge of the particular art and be in possession of the invention) (citations omitted). According to Rapoport:\nThe anxiolytic amount of buspirone taught by the FPR publication still inherently anticipates in view of the fact that the Dement et al. application contains disclosures that anxiolytic amounts of buspirone overlap the preferred therapeutically effective amounts of buspirone disclosed in the Dement et al. application for reducing the frequency and severity of the apnea episodes during sleep.\nSpecifically, Rapoport bases his argument on the observation that the Dement et al. application specifies administration of buspirone at the hour of sleep in dosages of about 20-40 mg for an average adult. Next, Rapoport notes that the FPR Publication discloses a dosage of 10 mg of buspirone three times a day for treatment of anxiety. The conclusion to be drawn from these observations, according to Rapoport, is as follows:\nThe fact that the Dement et al. specification recites a preferred range of 20-40 mg of buspirone administered at the time of sleep does not suggest that the administration of 10 mg of buspirone at the time of sleep, particularly when there have been two other dosages of 10 mg each during the course of the day, will have no therapeutic effect. The claims do not require optimal amounts, only therapeutically effective amounts. If 10 mg of buspirone has any effect on the treatment of sleep apnea, even if not optimum, the claim is anticipated.\nWe conclude that Rapoport's inherency argument is without merit. First, Rapoport neglects to point out that the FPR Publication explicitly states that the patients who received the 10 mg doses of buspirone three times a day were suffering from \"severe alveolar hypoventilation who needed anxiolytic therapy to facilitate the use of a nocturnal ventilator,\" not from sleep apnea. Second, Rapoport's argument is based on at least two speculative assumptions: (1) that a treatment regimen of three doses a day would necessarily include an administration \"at the time of sleep;\" and (2) that administering two 10 mg doses of buspirone atunspecified times throughout the day in conjunction with a 10 mg dose of buspirone at bedtime would necessarily result in a \"therapeutically effective amount\" of buspirone treatment for the purpose of treating the underlying sleep apnea disorder. \"Inherency, however, may not be established by probabilities or possibilities. The mere fact that a certain thing may result from a given set of circumstances is not sufficient.\" Cont'l Can Co. USA, Inc. v. Monsanto Co., 948 F.2d 1264, 1269, 20 USPQ2d 1746, 1749 (Fed.Cir.1991) (emphasis in original) (citations omitted). Rapoport has not attempted to demonstrate that the proposed dosage regimen in the FPR Publication would necessarily result in a therapeutically effective amount. Instead, Rapoport merely argues that the \"preferred\" range of 20-40 mg described in the Dement et al. application does not rule out the thrice-daily 10 mg doses of buspirone discussed in the FPR Publication in the context of patients who are not even described as suffering from sleep apnea. The burden of proof, of course, is on Rapoport, by a preponderance of the evidence. Bruning v. Hirose, 161 F.3d 681, 685-86, 48 USPQ2d 1934, 1937-38 (Fed.Cir.1998) (copending applications invoke the preponderance of the evidence standard).\nMost importantly, however, as we noted at the outset, the issue of anticipation-whether by inherency or otherwise-is a question of fact, and we uphold decisions of the Board on factual matters if there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Board's findings. In re Hyatt, 211 F.3d at 1371-72, 54 USPQ2d at 1667. In this case, as detailed above, our review of the record indicates that the Board's findings are amply supported by the evidence. The Board considered the evidence of record and correctly ruled against Rapoport on this issue.\nTherefore, for all the reasons stated above, we find that the Board's conclusion that the FPR Publication does not disclose administration of buspirone to patients suffering from sleep apnea to treat sleep apnea is supported by substantial evidence.\nNext, we address Rapoport's argument that the Board's action of denying Rapoport's Motion to Accept Belated Filing was an abuse of discretion. As noted earlier, this motion alleged that the Dement et al. claims are either anticipated under 35 U.S.C. § 102(g) and/or rendered obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 102(g) and/or § 103 over the prior invention of claims 7 and 13 of Dr. Dement, which were invented by a different inventive entity.\nOur review of the record indicates that the Board denied the Motion to Accept Belated Filing on the basis that Rapoport had filed it on July 9, 1993, approximately eight months after Rapoport should have been aware of the facts upon which the motion was based. As the Board correctly noted, Rapoport should have been aware when the interference was declared that the notice of interference accorded Dement et al. the benefit of the abandoned ′820 application, wherein Dr. Schwimmer signed an oath stating that he is the sole inventor of the claimed subject matter (i.e., using azapirones other than buspirone to treat sleep apnea). Moreover, the Board correctly indicated that Rapoport learned or should have been aware of the grounds of unpatentability urged in the preliminary motion for judgment on or about October 29, 1992, when Dement et al. filed a notification pursuant to 37 C.F.R. § 1.602(b) stating that Drs. Dement and Rosekind were obligated to assign their entire interest to Stanford and that Dr. Schwimmer was obligated to assign his entire interest to Bristol Myers.\nIn view of the above, we conclude that the Board did not abuse its discretion by denying Rappoport's Motion to Accept Belated Filing or in dismissing the preliminary motion for judgment, because there is evidence of record upon which the Board could base its decision that Rapoport did not show \"sufficient cause\" why the motion was not filed sooner, as required by 37 C.F.R. § 1.645(b).\nFinally, we turn to Rapoport's argument that the Board erred in awarding judgment on priority in favor of Dement et al. against Rapoport, notwithstanding the possibility that all of the Dement et al. claims could be ruled unpatentable to Dement et al. As Rapoport acknowledges, we need not reach this issue, given our conclusion that the Board did not err in finding that the Dement et al. claims were not rendered unpatentable by the FPR Publication.\n2021, No. 06 Archives - CJEO Journal\nChinese experts consensus on standardized construction of dry eye clinical center\n2021, No. 06, Current Issue, Highlights, Standard and Specification\nAuthor: Chinese Experts Consensus Members on Standardized Construction of Dry Eye Clinical Center, Dry Eye Rehabilitation Specialty, Visual Rehabilitation Committee of Chinese Rehabilitation Medicine Association DOI: 10.3760/cma.j.cn115989-20210223-00128 Published 2021-06-10 Cite asChin J Exp Ophthalmol, 2021, 39(6): 473-476.

Since he was born in California's San Fernando Valley, Sebastian has hardly spent any time outside a hospital. The diagnosis came within hours once doctors saw the moles on his skin: acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common childhood cancer and typically one of the most curable. Except in infants. Within a month, Sebastian was receiving round after round of chemotherapy, to no avail.\nSo the family came here to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital hoping that a cutting-edge experimental treatment would turn the tide. A peek inside his leukemia cells revealed a rearrangement in a gene called MLL that results in an abnormal protein that spurs cancer cells. \"That's the key driver,\" says Sebastian's oncologist, Tanja Gruber. She and her colleagues have discovered that several drugs primarily used to treat a different cancer, multiple myeloma, seem to target the aberrant MLL protein, stopping it from wreaking its havoc. So far, about 90 percent of children with this type of leukemia who have tried these drugs have had a positive response. Sebastian's drug cocktail has him in remission for the first time in his young life.\n\"You want your miracle to happen,\" says his mom, Jesenia Gonzalez. \"And we're just heading in the right direction.\" She has quit her job as a supervisor for a financial institution in California to be here, while her husband comes back and forth with their 8-year-old daughter. If he can beat the pneumonia and all else goes well, Sebastian will undergo a bone marrow transplant when he is stronger, weeks or months from now.\nPhotos: St. Jude Children's Research Hospital\nSebastian's treatment plan represents one of the newest strands of hope in managing pediatric cancer. Researchers and clinicians at St. Jude – the only National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center dedicated solely to children – see many of the rarest and most difficult cases, mostly as part of research trials. Besides being on the forefront of explorations into drug treatments targeted to mutations, they are applying the latest ultraprecision radiation and novel therapies that rev up the body's immune system – or a combination of all three – to tackle a disease that, all told, affects about 1 in 285 children in the U.S. before age 20.\nThe hospital cares for about 7,800 patients per year, absorbing all expenses that insurance doesn't cover. Families never receive a bill, and travel, food and lodging for up to four people are provided, too. U.S. News spent several days visiting St. Jude early this summer.\nWhen the hospital was founded in 1962 by entertainer Danny Thomas, the overall survival rate for childhood cancer was less than 20 percent. Today, some 80 percent of children in the U.S. survive, but the rate for some cancers is still below 50 percent, and the disease remains the leading cause of death from illness for kids in the nation. St. Jude's success rate mirrors the country's, even though many of its patients are among the sickest, says President and CEO James Downing; still, the losses are too \"staggering.\" About three-quarters of the funding that sustains St. Jude, its research and the family support comes from donations; the hospital's fundraising and awareness organization is one of the largest charities in the U.S., bringing in $851 million in public contributions in fiscal year 2013.\n\"We've been blessed with a lot,\" says Jason Burt, of Meridian, Texas, who has lived with his wife Jessica at Target House, St. Jude housing a few miles from campus, while their 5-year-old daughter Maddy has been receiving treatment. In February, after Maddy had been pained for some time by worsening headaches, vomiting and vision problems, her family learned she had a medulloblastoma, a brain tumor. When Maddy suddenly stopped breathing and fell into a coma, she was rushed in for surgery to remove the tumor at a hospital in Texas. In March, she came to St. Jude for several rounds of chemo.\nThis June day, Maddy and her parents are painting a poster decorated with the word \"faith\" in her room, guided by Ashley Anderst, one of 17 \"child life specialists\" on the staff. Each patient is assigned a primary specialist who gets to know the families, answers their questions and assists them in navigating the hospital. The child life specialists also engage their charges in play, art and music to normalize their days and to help them socialize.\nThe way St. Jude cares for families as well as patients was a pleasant \"culture shock,\" says Tom Roenspie of Orland, California, whose son Ty, 3, is here for several weeks of radiation and chemo for an ependymoma, a different type of brain tumor. Ty also gets regular physical and speech therapy, as he, mom Megan and 1-year-old brother Lane stay in St. Jude housing a short drive from the hospital with shared kitchens, common areas and playrooms. Lane, too, is fixed up with chocolate milk after Ty has radiation. \"They cater to both of them,\" says Roenspie.\nThis kind of enveloping care has helped Maddy get through her fourth and final cycle of chemo. She is responding well, says Amar Gajjar, her doctor and director of neuro-oncology. Next, she will undergo proton therapy, an ultratargeted radiation treatment that minimizes the exposure of other tissue. That's especially important in a case like Maddy's, since her brain has a lot of growing to do, he notes.\nConventional photon therapy goes \"all the way through you,\" says Thomas Merchant, chair of radiation oncology. With proton therapy, clinicians can almost \"paint the radiation dose in layer by layer, spot by spot\" with a high degree of accuracy. A 2012 review in the journal Radiation Oncology by Mayo Clinic researchers showed that treating medulloblastoma with proton therapy entails a risk of radiation-induced cancer that is 8 to 15 times lower than that associated with photon treatment. St. Jude's own $90 million proton therapy center, the world's first specifically designed for children, is expected to open later this year or early next. Maddy will go for proton therapy sooner, at the hospital's University of Florida partner facility.\nDrugs like those that have put Sebastian Perez's leukemia into remission are a key aim of the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project, a St. Jude initiative with Washington University in St. Louis that has so far entailed sequencing the entire genomes of some 700 young patients since 2010. While oncologists across the country are increasingly testing patients for certain specific mutations that might respond to targeted treatments, the St. Jude-Wash U effort provides a far wider window into what might have gone wrong in a patient's DNA by exhaustively comparing the genetics of a child's cancerous and healthy cells. Today, it's an effort \"unparalleled across the world,\" Downing says. But the process \"will ultimately become part of the routine\" in cancer care. This summer, St. Jude begins sequencing the genomes of some cancer patients as they arrive, with the goal of eventually doing so for everyone.\nThe project has already borne fruit. In 2012, for example, researchers discovered the mechanism that causes the eye cancer retinoblastoma to develop rapidly by examining the genomes of several St. Jude patients. Work is underway to develop a treatment that has shown success in the lab at blocking that mechanism. Researchers also have identified 41 genes associated with medulloblastoma, some of which are already being investigated as targets for drug development.\nInside a playroom filled with puzzles, books and toys, Mack Ward, 6, practices changing the bandage on the chest of a bald medical doll. \"You probably use something like that [bandage] on your line,\" says child life specialist Ashley Wedderburn, referring to the catheter into his chest through which he receives IV chemotherapy. The Rogersville, Tennessee, native was diagnosed late last year with Ewing sarcoma, a type of bone cancer, after treatment for a misdiagnosed bone infection. He and his family arrived on Christmas Eve, with Mack's kidneys and liver starting to fail. St. Jude doctors stabilized him and started chemotherapy. Now his tumor is shrinking. \"He's had a very, very good response,\" says oncologist Sara Federico.\nOnce chemo is finished this summer, surgery will be scheduled to remove the tumor, which has invaded more than half of his shinbone. The family lives in Target House while his father, Ryan, takes a break from his job as a mechanic; each month, one of Mack's three siblings, who live with friends or relatives, comes to visit. Two or three times a week, around treatments, Mack meets with a teacher in a classroom at the nearby Patient Care Center. St. Jude's school program employs six K-12 teachers to help the children stay on track academically and developmentally as it coordinates lessons with their home schools. \"We are not here to treat just a child's illness,\" says Laurie Leigh, the program's director.\nOn the playground behind Target House, Ana Rogulic, 3, and her brother Branko, 8, play with their father, Jovan, as they prepare to say their goodbyes and head back home to Serbia. In early 2014, Ana was diagnosed with high-risk neuroblastoma, a cancer of the nerve cells that kills 50 percent to 60 percent of patients. Ana's mother, Bojana, learned of an experimental treatment here, and the family arrived that March.\nAlong with chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, Ana's treatment has involved a groundbreaking approach to battling tumors called immunotherapy. She received infusions of an antibody that prompts the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. Earlier this year, the Food and Drug Administration approved an antibody drug called Unituxin after trials showed it to be effective against neuroblastoma. Ana's particular antibody treatment has been engineered to reduce allergic reactions and pain, significant side effects, notes her oncologist, Wayne Furman. Ana has responded well: Her cancer and pain are gone.\nOver the next year, Ana will return to St. Jude every few months for checkups, then at least once a year for the next five. Such visits are a key part of the hospital's strategy to be ready with a new plan of attack should a cancer return, as well as to get a handle on the long-term effects of treatment. \"Our patients have been our collaborators for years,\" says oncologist Melissa Hudson, who directs the cancer survivorship division. Thousands of people treated for childhood cancer at St. Jude have returned over the years for comprehensive evaluations, paid for in part by the hospital.\n\"It's like a homecoming for me,\" says Jason Witt, 35, of Southaven, Mississippi, located about 12 miles away. Jason was treated for leukemia at St. Jude as a teenager. The high school finance and accounting teacher has returned several times, and he even met his wife, a St. Jude nurse, when he was volunteering at the hospital.\nJosué Fernando Mendizábal is a fighter. An avid boxer in his native Guatemala, the 16-year-old \"is a little bit tired today,\" notes oncologist Raul Ribeiro as he examines him. Josué was diagnosed about a year ago with acute myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the blood cells. Standard chemotherapy treatment in his home country wasn't proving effective, so Josué was referred to St. Jude and put on an experimental regimen involving several drugs, including one that appears to boost the action of tumor suppression proteins and stop cancer cells from growing.\nWhen he arrived, about 80 percent of Josué's white blood cells were myeloblasts, immature cells that form in the bone marrow and disrupt the normal production of healthy blood cells. After two weeks on the drugs, Josué's blasts were down to about 28 percent, a marked improvement but not enough to safely perform a bone marrow transplant, his best shot at a cure. Ribeiro gave him another drug combination that eventually reduced Josué's percentage of blasts to under 1 percent. \"We can give very intense chemotherapy,\" supporting the patient through it, Ribeiro says. (Josué eventually underwent a bone marrow transplant and will stay at St. Jude for several months to be sure it worked.) \"When I was in Guatemala, I thought everything was over,\" Josué says through an interpreter. \"People should always fight.\"\nPaishence Joi Watkins has been fighting since 2012, when the then-8-year-old was diagnosed with osteosarcoma in her right femur. After several rounds of chemo and a surgery to replace cancerous bone with a titanium rod, she's back from Lafayette, Indiana, for a limb-lengthening procedure. Clinicians surround her leg with a high-powered electromagnet that heats and expands the rod a few millimeters so her right leg can grow along with her left. Paishence, now 12, has been cancer-free for more than two years.\nShe comes back for the procedure about once a month, taking time to catch up with doctors and nurses and play air hockey with her mom or other kids. With the future looking bright, coming back is a treat. \"I look forward to it,\" she says.\nEating Mediterranean or DASH-style diets, regularly engaging in physical activity and keeping your blood pressure under control can lower your risk of a first-time stroke.\nThe research is based on theupdated AHA/ASA guideline published in the American Heart Association’s journal Stroke[KA1] ."

        "description": "Intervertebral discs are the strong layers of soft tissue that lie between our vertebrae in the spine to act as shock absorbers due to weight bearing and forces that our spines are subjected to. When we rotate our backs, injuries can occur to the discs. There can be tears, disc herniation or disc prolapse. The risk of injury to the discs is enhanced if we rotate whilst in a flexed position so lifting and twisting movements for example digging the garden, putting the baby in the car or doing unsafe exercises.\nSometimes pain can be felt down the leg and into the foot (lower back) or arms and hands (neck) and is often more painful than the back itself.\nLoss of sensation to the perineal region, or bladder/bowel incontinence or inability to pass anything in the toilet (surgical emergency whereby decompression of nerve root required).\nThe diagnosis of disc disease can be made from the case history and examination findings but the actual location and extent of disc disease would be clarified from a MRI scan.\nOsteopathy can provide disc treatment by reducing the pain associated with disc disease. It will aid a reduction of inflammation and muscle spasm to the surrounding area, and improving function to the vertebrae above and below the affected region. Osteopathic treatment for disc disease uses a combination of soft tissue massage, manipulation to surrounding areas and traction to the affected part of the spine whilst you are in a position of greatest comfort. Disc injuries and in particular herniated disc treatment usually takes approximately 6 weeks to heal so patience and compliance with treatment and exercises is very important. Disc prolapses can take longer and may require surgery.\nThe cause of disc disease would also need to be established so advice can be given on not repeating the same injury in the future. This may be related to work, recreational or sporting activities for example.\nPeople get extra testy at nightclub coat checks because they’re generally extremely desperate to either get in or get out.\nI learned this when I recently tried to exit a club–got to get my beauty sleep–going ahead to what looked like the departing coat-check line.\nBut I thought I was just moving forward to my proper place (and besides, when there’s a crowd waiting to get in, the coat check people LOVE giving back your coat so they can have the hanger space).\nI gestured for the guy to get ahead of me if he wanted, but he just stood there, no doubt immobilized by the booze and lord knows what else.\nInstead of moving ahead, he called a friend on his cell and loudly stated, “I guess I should have gone into journalism, not a real profession like nursing!”\nAs I left with my coat, I passed the stewed prune–still standing there in his self-generated K-hole–and he snarled, “Don’t ever go to Columbia Presbyterian operating room!”\nDigital data must be secured for personal privacy and protection from malicious intent. The regulatory framework and industry best practices for compliance are among the most significant components of the Internet because without these standards, private digital data could be used fraudulently. Most regulations and policies are intended to protect personal and financial information, and they define how data is organized, stored, transferred, and managed.\nData compliance is the activity of obeying the regulations and practices that safeguard data. Many organizations choose to exceed their legal obligations and develop policies and protocols that are far more strict.\nGoals\nOrganizations set data compliance goals that align with regulations and standards, conforming to these rules to avoid fines for noncompliance. In the most extreme cases, executives could go to jail for noncompliance, but this is rare.\nThe underlying goals of data compliance include:\nProtection from security breaches.\nSafeguarding sensitive information from competitors.\nBuilding the trust of clients and customers.\nGuarding against data loss.\nBuilding goodwill between the organization and regulatory bodies.\nPromoting accountability within the organization.\nStandards\nThe four compliance standards detailed below were selected because they are among the ones you are most likely to encounter. There are thousands more, however, so consider checking the regulatory framework specific to your industry and geographic area.\nThe EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)is the most comprehensive data protection standard. It mandates that people have the right to know the data that organizations are retaining about them, and how the data can be used. In addition, this standard requires obtaining consent, defines the amount of data an entity may hold, clarifies the rights of individuals, and describes the protocols for reporting data breaches. Any entity that interacts with an individual subject to the EU’s jurisdiction is required to follow this standard.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) is a U.S. law pertaining to how organizations with medical data ensure the confidentiality and security of those records. The Act requires that such documents may only be seen by persons with valid reasons for viewing them, and requires audit trails for every interaction with that data.\nThe Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCIDSS) is an industry-based set of rules that protects customers’ financial information. Noncompliance can result in significant fines or termination of service with payment processors.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) protects the privacy and applies to companies that (1) receive 50%+ of their revenue from the sale of customer information; (2) have gross revenues above $25 million; and (3) use or are the repositories of the personal information of at least 50,000 households, businesses, consumers, or devices. Organizations do not need to have a physical presence in California to be subject to this provision.\nBest Practices for Compliance\nIdentify the personal data your organization holds and know how it is being used.\nSecure personal data with a comprehensive strategy that guards against breaches and unauthorized disclosure during the data’s entire life cycle.\nDocument and review data protection policies, and conduct regular risk assessments.\nPromptly comply with all applicable standards.\nAssign tasks and responsibilities related to data protection.\nUnderstand your organization’s ethical data privacy obligations to your customers and clients.\nCreate processes for handling customer complaints, deleting information, producing personal information reports, responding to data requests, and correcting data breaches.\nProvide adequate training for your compliance program.\nSummary\nFailure to comply with data laws, regulations and standards can cost your organization dearly with tarnished public perception, fines and other punishments, and financial losses due to data breaches. Data compliance should be a top priority for every organization that handles sensitive customer data. Commit to reviewing your organization’s accountability and upgrade compliance procedures immediately.\nFor companies handling digital information, a Trust Center is essential in helping your customers understand how you are keeping their data private and secure and what you are actively doing in keeping your compliance with data protection and privacy laws.\nYou may contact one of our trust center experts to find out how to get started with a reliable trust center.\nPlease email us at success@trustcenter.io to schedule a no-pressure, free consultation.\nTRUST CENTER BETA\nDO YOU WANT TO CREATE A TRUST CENTER BUT NOT SURE WHERE TO START?\nWe offer a free turn-key solution to create a world-class trust center.

In order to meet this criteria, College of American Pathologists (CAP) and other groups have pushed for pathologists to adopt synoptic reporting - that is a structured, electronic report that captures each of these elements in a standardized way that can easily be gather and organized for treatment and research purposes.\nThere's no reason to delay in adopting these solutions because adhering to these synoptic requirements positively affects many people in multiple ways. Members of a cancer program don't have to worry about accreditation lapsing due to an oversight, since the lab is already using synoptic reporting. Pathologists and their lab will gain (or at least, not lose any) customers since they can boast that their practices won't break a cancer program's accreditation. Most importantly it will lead to better care of patients. Structured data captured in synoptic reports is much easier to use in research or when sending in to the National Cancer Registry. These points of data are now ordered so that like will be compared to like, providing a much clearer view of the current state of Cancer in our patients in much faster time. The physicians are better informed about particular outcomes and recent trends in cancer diagnoses and treatments. The better informed the physician, the better care the patient receives. And no matter what else might change in healthcare - better care remains the top goal for all of us.\nCode of Ethics of the American Anthropological Association | Delve\nAnthropology is a multidisciplinary field of science and scholarship, which includes the study of all aspects of humankind–archaeological, biological, linguistic and sociocultural. Anthropology has roots in the natural and social sciences and in the humanities, ranging in approach from basic to applied research and to scholarly interpretation.\nIn both proposing and carrying out research, anthropological researchers must be open about the purpose(s), potential impacts, and source(s) of support for research projects with funders, colleagues, persons studied or providing information, and with relevant parties affected by the research. Researchers must expect to utilize the results of their work in an appropriate fashion and disseminate the results through appropriate and timely activities. Research fulfilling these expectations is ethical, regardless of the source of funding (public or private) or purpose (i.e., \"applied,\" \"basic,\" \"pure,\" or \"proprietary\").\nPlastic Surgery Concept and Things to Know about it - Concept BB\nA cosmetic surgery is a certain branch of plastic surgery that includes both surgical as well as non surgical procedures. It can actually bring some change in the physical appearance of a human being.\nBut again, cosmetic surgery has some of its risks and limitations. So, before undergoing them, there are a few factors to consider.\nOne should know that a cosmetic surgery can change the appearance of an individual by reshaping or altering the parts of the body which may function normally but they do not look the way pone wants them to look like.\nSo, when there is cosmetic surgery, there are expectations. One can only anticipate improvement, but there may be no perfection in it. One should not consider a cosmetic surgery in order to gain a promotion or to improve the social life.\nThis is not a very usual case of surgery and so it is an expensive one. But unlike any of the critical or major surgeries, they are not covered by most health insurance plans. The cost of the surgery here varies, depending on the procedure of the surgery. It also includes the follow up care costs and the additional corrective measure costs.\nSometimes cosmetic surgeries can also lead to dissatisfaction. There can be surgical complications as well like excessive bleeding or infection in the area where the surgery has been done.\nAfter the surgical process is over, then one can need a good amount of days (like a couple of weeks or even months) in order to recover. There can be some physical effects as well as a part of the recovery process and the surgery can affect both personal and professional life of an individual. If one smokes then they should stop doing that beforehand (at least a month before surgery) and also during the time of recovery because it will minimise the risk of complications.\nWhen one is looking for a plastic surgeon in Bhopal one needs to find a qualified one. One needs to choose a person who specialises in the procedure. Once the person who wants to undergo the surgery narrows down their search, they need to go for a consultation with them. The surgeon will there evaluate the part of the body which one wants to or needed to be treated and then go through the medical history of the patient and then go for the medications and decide on the treatment and the surgery process.\nThe person who wants to go for a plastic surgery needs to ask a few questions to the surgeon:\nCan there be other treatment procedures which can work well apart from the surgery?\nWhat can be the procedure and what can be the expected results from it?\nCan the desired effect be achieved at a single go of surgery?\nThe person who wants to go for a plastic surgery has to be mentally confident and focused that they want to do it and they also should be prepared about the outcome.\nThree be very competitive for medication pricing as well as to the latest version, or try reported.

Although there is a pet, it may just be resting\nGoogle Inc. (or rather, Alphabet Holding, of which Google is a part) decided to conduct an interesting experiment related to the field of medicine. According to the search queries of users of mobile devices, Google's algorithms will distinguish users with depression. This project will start the other day, so that soon depressed Americans will be able to get informational support.\nIn our turbulent times, dozens, if not hundreds of millions of people suffer from depression. According to the medical definition, it is a mental disorder, which is characterized by a decrease in mood, loss of the ability to experience joy, impaired thinking, and a decrease in performance. In the latter case, the person looks at everything through the prism of the negative and goes into the camp of pessimists. It is worth noting that older people are three times more depressed than young or middle-aged people. In the US, every fifth person suffers from depression.\nIn addition to the main ones, doctors distinguish additional symptoms of depression:\nguilt, worthlessness, anxiety and (or) fear;\nthoughts of death and (or) suicide;\nunstable appetite, marked decrease or gain in weight;\nglycogensia\ndisturbed sleep, the presence of insomnia or sleep.\nThe World Health Organization claims that depression is one of the main causes of adolescent morbidity and disability. About 5% of children and adolescents in the age group from 10 to 16 years are exposed to it. According to Americans, only every second person tries to treat depression in one way or another , the rest do nothing for it.\nHow is Google going to identify people suffering from depression and what will the search engine do? If an American (I remind you that this project is relevant only for the United States so far), will enter the corresponding queries into the Google search string, the latter will give information about the disorder itself and how to treat it.\nIf you wish, you can take a short test that can show whether a person really suffers from depression, or simply seems to him (or else he suffers from something else). This is a questionnaire PHQ-9 . The results will not be shared, this is private information, which, according to the idea of ​​the corporation representatives, will help people get rid of their ailments.\nIf the diagnosis of \"clinical depression\" is confirmed , then the person can only go to the doctor, who will prescribe a course of treatment. The project is being implemented jointly with the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Experts say that clinical depression is curable. If nothing is done, this disease can affect many aspects of a person's life. However, some people begin to be treated (or at least do something) after 6-8 years (!) After the first symptoms of depression appear. Clinical depression (major depressive disorder) also has variations. One of them is known as dysthymia . This is a chronic mood disorder, when a person complains of his bad mood every day for several years.\nIt is quite difficult for doctors to diagnose depression, since its symptoms are similar to the symptoms of other mental problems. Some patients simply fear antidepressants and the fact that they are prescribed something potent. Others believe that they themselves will cope with the problem, and talk about it is considered a sign of weakness. There are also people who are just afraid to get a psychiatrist.\nDue to the fact that information about the depression will be issued by Google, and in the main issue, this data will be seen by millions of people. They will immediately be able to receive informational or any other support, of course, if they wish to receive such assistance. Perhaps, if the project is recognized as successful, it will expand to other countries. But so far it is difficult to say when this will happen and whether it will happen at all. So it remains to observe the project in the United States.\nSingle Hypoglycemic Emergency Raises Risk of Death within 3 years for Diabetics, Says Study | The Diabetic News\nSingle Hypoglycemic Emergency Raises Risk of Death within 3 years for Diabetics, Says Study\nOne to two per 100 people with diabetes per year experience severe hypoglycemia ending in a hospital visit.\nAlarming study showed that within three years of a dangerously low blood sugar episode requiring an emergency department visit, one-third of those in the study died. This is significant because each year, 1-2-percent of diabetics have a hypoglycemic event that leads to a hospital visit.\nAdditionally, using data from a large, longitudinal study, the researchers found that one third of the older adults with diabetes who had experienced a severe low blood sugar episode (hypoglycemia) died within three years of the incident.\nIn analyzing their data, the researchers controlled for such variables as how severe a person's diabetes was and how long it had been since diagnosis.\nThe researchers say that their findings suggest that doctors might want to pay special attention to patients who have been sent to the emergency department for hypoglycemia after losing consciousness, having a seizure or experiencing another serious health event. The findings were presented March 10 at the American Heart Association's EPI|LIFESTYLE 2017 Scientific Sessions in Portland, Ore.\n\"If you have a patient with a history of severe hypoglycemia, this could portend poorly for his or her future,\" says Alexandra K. Lee, MSPH, a PhD candidate in epidemiology at the Bloomberg School. \"Our thinking has been that you resolve a hypoglycemic episode and it's over. But what this tells us is that one episode may have long-lasting consequences.\"\nSays the study's senior author, Elizabeth Selvin, PhD, a professor of epidemiology at the School: \"Hypoglycemia is clearly an under-recognized risk factor for death and cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes. We are treating many people in this country for high blood sugar. They need to be very careful that their treatment doesn't go too far and cause hypoglycemia, a potentially more serious condition than we have truly understood.\"\nDiabetes is a condition marked by the inability of the body to properly manage the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Poorly controlled blood sugar – when blood sugar levels are too high – can lead to future complications such as blindness and nerve damage.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, roughly 29 million Americans have diabetes and other estimates say that roughly 85 percent are taking medication to lower their blood sugar.\nSometimes, those efforts to lower blood sugar with medication go too far. One to two per 100 people with diabetes per year experience severe hypoglycemia ending in a hospital visit, Lee says.\nFor the study, the researchers analyzed data from participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) cohort, a study of 15,792 residents in four communities in the United States, who were between the ages of 45 and 64 when the study began in 1987. Specifically, the researchers focused on 1,198 participants with type 2 diabetes, who were followed for an average of 15 years.\nThey found that 192 experienced hypoglycemia that led to an emergency room visit or hospitalization. Those people were nearly twice as likely to die of any cause than those people with diabetes who did not have severe hypoglycemia.\nResearchers say that past studies have shown that people who experience severe hypoglycemia experience low-level heart damage, so a biological link between hypoglycemia and death from cardiovascular disease could be an extension of that. Additionally, the researchers say it isn't clear whether people who suffer from a hypoglycemic episode are already sicker than those who do not, or if the episode is what sickens them.\nDiabetes medications like metformin, which are designed to lower high blood sugar, can be valuable in some patients, Selvin says, but they are not the \"miracle\" treatment that statins tend to be for people with high cholesterol. If diabetes medications are used improperly, blood sugar can get dangerously low.\nAt the same time, the benefits to small arteries of lowering blood sugar are often not realized for decades. Considering the risks of hypoglycemia, Selvin says that many older adults may see a downside and minimal upside to being on these diabetes medications.\n\"If the benefit is 10 or 20 years down the line and your patients are in their 70s, maybe we shouldn't be putting them on anti-diabetes medications,\" Selvin says. \"It's something to consider.\"\n\"Association of Severe Hypoglycemia with Cardiovascular Disease and All-Cause Mortality in Older Adults with Diabetes: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study\" was written by Alexandra K.

Patent Application Denied\nThe decision on Aug. 10 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the nation's highest patent court, rejected the patent application of scientists at the University of California who claimed to have made the discovery. The court ruled against the scientists on the basis of a legal technicality. But in discussing the history of the research, the court essentially agreed that the scientists were the true pioneers.\nThe court suggested in a footnote that a very broad patent was awarded last fall to Genentech for a discovery based on the work done at the University of California. The footnote could provide an opening for Genentech's competitors to challenge the patent.\nGenentech's patent is so broad that, in theory, almost every company trying to make drugs through recombinant DNA technology needs a license from Genentech. Watershed Case\n''The decision will probably be a watershed case in determining the obviousness of biotechnology inventions,'' said S. Leslie Misrock, a patent attorney in New York who represents many companies involved in biotechnology. ''Personally, I think it will have a significant impact on Genentech's Itakura patent.'' The company's patent is named after one of its researchers, Keiichi Itakura.\nPatent experts also said that the full implications of the decision depend on how Genentech tries to use its patent. The company has publicly said it will grant nonexclusive licenses to other firms and that it will surrender all royalties to a charitable foundation that will finance new scientific research.\nThus far, however, the firm has not disclosed the terms it will impose on licensees. Officials at other biotechnology companies are worried, moreover, that Genentech could simply refuse to grant licenses to companies producing drugs that compete directly with its own. Drug to Dissolve Clots\nFor example, Genentech says it generated $100 million in sales on tissue plasminogen activator, a blood-clot-dissolving drug, in the five months after it received marketing approval last November from the Food and Drug Administration. But Burroughs-Wellcome, a subsidiary of Wellcome P.L.C. of Britain, is in clinical trials with its own version of the drug, and the two are locked in lawsuits over patent infringement. Genentech has two specific patents on the drug itself, but it can also cite its more basic claim to strengthen its case.\nThe rulings could ultimately affect an array of new drugs, including anti-cancer drugs like interferon and Interleukin-2. These and other biotechnology-based drugs are just beginning to receive Federal approval for marketing.\nBiotechnology firms are still assessing the implications of the ruling, known in legal terms as ''In Re Patrick H. O'Farrell, Barry A. Polisky and David H. Gelfand.'' The three were the scientists at the University of California involved in the earlier work. 'Far-Reaching Impact'\n''The court recognized that what they did was pioneering, that it actually predated the work that Genentech did,'' Albert Halluin said of the university researchers. He is chief intellectual property counsel for the Cetus Corporation of Emeryville, Calif.\n''The case will certainly have a far-reaching impact,'' Mr. Halluin said.\nThe dispute goes back to 1973 when biotechnology was in its infancy and Stanley Cohen of Stanford University and Herbert Boyer of the University of California successfully inserted genes from a toad into bacteria. Genes are segments of DNA that carry the instructions for creating the individual proteins that make up a living organism. The Cohen-Boyer discovery opened the prospect of breeding bacteria that could serve as living factories for human protein.\nOne major hurdle, however, was that researchers still had not figured out how to make a transplanted human gene begin producing proteins. Missing Link\nIn 1976 a team led by Mr. Polisky and Mr. Gelfand at the University of California reported what appeared to be the missing link. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they reported their success at getting bacteria to produce ribosomal RNA - a key step in reading genetic codes. The researchers also predicted that their method would probably yield more commercially valuable proteins.\nThey confirmed this prediction a few months later, but did not publish a second article until 1978, when the university applied for a patent.\nThe Patent and Trademark Office rejected the application on the ground that the scientists' 1976 article laid out the entire blueprint for producing proteins and that actually producing them had been obvious from their own published work. Under Federal patent law, inventors may wait one year after publishing their results before applying for a patent. After that deadline, however, an invention is considered public knowledge and unpatentable. The patent office said the scientists had made their real discovery in 1976 and had waited too long to apply for a patent.\nrelief - Inventiva\nHome/relief\nShrijaMay 30, 2021\nPM Modi Announces Financial Aid Under PM's Care Fund For Children Orphaned By COVID-19, Thanks Citizens For Their Abundant Contribution To PM's Care Fund\nThe second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has excruciated millions of people.

        "description": "Health insurance doesn't mean access to health care\nExpansions of Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) are designed to extend access to high-quality medical care to all U.S. children. However, evidence suggests that the 37 million children covered by Medicaid-CHIP are less likely to receive specialty care than children covered by commercial insurance, say Joanna Bisgaier, M.S.W., and Karin V. Rhodes, M.D.\nChildren covered by Medicaid-CHIP may face greater barriers to specialist care as a result of fewer resources within their families, including lower levels of income, education, language proficiency and health literacy.\nAnother possible explanation for disparities is that specialists choose not to accept public insurance.\nWith the use of an experimental study design involving simulated requests for specialty care, Bisgaier and Rhodes measured real-world scheduling behaviour in an urban area with a high density of medical specialists.\nThe results showed significant disparities in children's access to needed outpatient specialty care, attributable to specialists' reluctance to accept public health insurance; these results held across all audited specialties.\nMoreover, even when children with Medicaid-CHIP were not denied appointments outright, the appointments were, on average, 22 days later than those obtained for privately insured children with identical health conditions.\nNotably, even callers claiming to have a privately insured child faced an average wait time of 20 days when urgently requesting an appointment.\nThese findings signal a need to consider refining specialty care delivery processes to more efficiently use the specialist workforce, say Bisgaier and Rhodes.\nSource: Joanna Bisgaier and Karin V. Rhodes, Auditing Access to Specialty Care for Children with Public Insurance, New England Journal of Medicine, June 15, 2011.\nThe acute treatment of lacunar infarctions is like that of acute ischemic strokes. Within 4.5 hours of symptom onset, patients should receive intravenous (IV) alteplase therapy. The contraindications to IV thrombolysis is the same as those for other types of acute ischemic strokes, some of which include ischemic stroke/head trauma in the past 3 months, previous intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy or hemorrhage in the past 21 days, intracranial/spinal surgery in the past 3 months, and intra-axial intracranial neoplasm. For those patients not eligible for IV alteplase therapy, aspirin therapy is recommended. Otherwise, the acute treatment involves stabilization and early involvement of rehabilitation with speech and physical therapy.\nThe most important aspect of treatment for these patients is preventative. Aggressive blood pressure control, early high-dose statin therapy, and antiplatelet therapy are crucial. Anti-platelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and fixed-dose aspirin with dipyramidal are all acceptable medications. With the results of the CHANCE trial and the POINT trial, dual antiplatelet therapy for 3 weeks followed by single antiplatelet will provide the best scheme of therapy. More prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel + aspirin) has not been shown to decrease the risk of recurrent strokes and resulted in a significantly increased risk of bleeding and death.[11] The present-day scheme of “aggressive medical therapy” with antiplatelet treatment, aggressive blood pressure control with a target of 120/80 mm Hg, high dose statin, good blood sugar control, stopping smoking, sodium reduction, and good weight control and lifestyle modification should be able to prevent at least 80% of strokes.[12] The LDL should be lowered to less than 100 with a high-intensity statin. Usually a high-intensity statin decreases LDL approximately 50% on an average. Strategies to reduce HbA1C less than 7 are also very important.\nCobb County Fire and Emergency Services news | Latest news & announcements about Cobb County Fire and Emergency Services | Fire Industry News\nCobb County Fire and Emergency Services News\nCobb County Fire & Emergency Services Will Be Assisting Baking Memories 4 Kids\nOn Thursday, December 13th, 2018, Cobb County Fire & Emergency Services will be assisting Baking Memories 4 Kids to surprise a family with exciting news.

Although the results revealed better pain management with the help of CBD oil, more research is still needed.\nA 2014 study published in the British Journal of Pharmacology investigated the therapeutic potential of CBD in treating chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (CIPN). The research team concluded that adjunct treatment with CBD during paclitaxel (PAC) chemotherapy may be safe and effective in the prevention or attenuation of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.\nAnecdotal evidence on CBD for pain relief is abundant, which is why researchers often try to find out whether that is due to the CBD or just a placebo effect.\nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine currently has 25 clinical studies listed on CBD for pain. Only a handful of those have been completed, most of the subjects are people with advanced cancer, and treatment usually involved combining CBD with THC. While some of them exhibit positive results, others demonstrate only placebo relief.\nMajority of the studies on CBD involve mice rather than humans. And in those human clinical trials, the test group often involves only a small number of subjects. The short trial period also does not provide reliable data on the long-term effects of cannabis-based treatment.\nWith the CBD market in full swing and expected to be worth $646 million by the year 2020, science has a lot of catching up to do.\nIn a 2008 study of the anti-hyperalgesic effect of a Cannabis sativa extract, researchers found that a controlled cannabis extract containing a defined ratio of multiple cannabinoids and other non-cannabinoid fractions such as terpenes and flavonoids provided better anti-nociceptive efficacy than a single cannabinoid molecule.\nAgain in 2011, a study showed that two non-psychoactive cannabinoids – cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabichromene (CBC) – stimulated descending pathways of anti-nociception and caused analgesia by interacting with several target proteins involved in nociceptive control. These compounds when combined might represent useful therapeutic agents for pain management.\nWhile CBD isolates represent the purest form of CBD, full-spectrum CBD is considered more effective in treating pain. CBD plus the terpenes and flavonoids of the entire cannabis plant is more beneficial than a single CBD molecule alone.\nCBD is not regulated as medicine by the FDA. It is considered a food supplement so dosages should be approached with caution.\nWhen creating a CBD for pain regimen, one should aim for maximum relief. Preventive maintenance is more important than managing acute flair ups.\nThe best way to manage pain is to take full spectrum CBD oil daily in the form of oral capsule or sublingual tincture. Both products contain the same ingredients but differ in dosage and form.\nStart with a baseline of 5mg to 10mg per day and increase by 5mg to 10mg until the desired pain relief is achieved. Keep in mind that ingestible CBD products have a delayed onset time. It can take up to 90 minutes for CBD capsules and CBD tinctures to take full effect.\nMost CBD gel capsules are sold in 25mg pills. While this is way higher than the prescribed 5mg to 10mg dosage, there is no harm in starting at 25mg daily. No one overdoses on CBD!\nCBD products that are taken orally are known to provide sustained relief for several hours – even one whole day!\nFor muscle and joint pain, we recommend supplementing on a CBD topical salve. Apply this extra strength rub directly to the skin for instant relief of aches in muscles, bones, tendons, ligaments, or myofascial tissue. CBD topical products are able to penetrate deep into the skin to reduce pain and inflammation. One can feel the effects within 15 minutes. Apply again if necessary.\nFor acute flair ups caused by cold weather, recent injury, or general aggravation, we recommend vaping or dabbing a CBD isolate for immediate relief. Each CBD isolate contains 99% CBD and provides a wave of relief throughout the body.\n“CBD is generally well tolerated,” says Dr. Seth Waldman, anesthesiologist and director of the pain management division at the Hospital for Special Surgery (ranked No. 1 for orthopedics and No. 3 for rheumatology in the US).\nSince it is well tolerated by the human body, cannabidiol has a distinct advantage over other pain medications such as steroids, opioids, anticonvulsants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and antidepressant medications.\nThe difference of lens thickness measured by immersion A-scan ultrasound versus Lenstar optical biometry in various types of cataract eyes and its clinical significance - CJEO Journal\nThe difference of lens thickness measured by immersion A-scan ultrasound versus Lenstar optical biometry in various types of cataract eyes and its clinical significance\nAuthors:Xue Wenchen, Song Hui, Tang Xin\nDOI: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.2095-0160.2016.12.015\nCite as Chin J Exp Ophthalmol, 2016,34(12): 1121-1125.\nCataract is the main cause of global blindness, and surgery is the main method for the treatment of cataract, so precise preoperative parameters have an important significance for improving postoperative visual quality.\nThis study was to analyze the difference of lens thickness (LT) measured by immersion A-scan ultrasound versus optical biometry and consistency of these two methods in measuring the LT for different types of cataract eyes, and to investigate whether A-scan ultrasound for the LT measurement needs to correct the ultrasound speed parameter.\nA reliability evaluation of diagnosis test was designed.The LT was measured on 143 cataract eyes using immersion A-scan ultrasound and Lenstar optical biometry in Tianjin Eye Hospital from September 2013 to May 2014.The eyes were assigned to nuclear cataract group (60 eyes of 50 patients), posterior subcapsular cataract group (40 eyes of 40 patients) and cortical cataract group (43 eyes of 43 patients) based on the types of cataract, and the hardness of nucleus was grade Ⅱ in 20 eyes of 14 patients, grade Ⅲ in 20 eyes of 17 patients and grade Ⅳ in 20 eyes of 19 patients.The outcomes measured by immersion A-scan ultrasound versus Lenstar optical biometry were compared with paired t test, and the consistency between the two devices was analyzed by Bland-Altman agreement plot.This study complied with Helsinki declaration, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to any examination.\nThe mean LT value was (4.85± 0.39)mm from the immersion A-scan ultrasound and (4.74±0.37)mm from the Lenstar optical biometry, with a significant difference between the two devices (t=3.020, P=0.004). No significant differences were found in the LT values of the posterior subcapsular cataractous eyes and cortical cataractous eyes between the two devices (t=1.015, P=0.316; t=1.275, P=0.209). The LT values by immersion A-scan ultrasound were significantly higher in gradeⅡ, Ⅲ and Ⅳ nuclear cataractous eyes than those by Lenstar optical biometry (t=2.175, 2.378, 2.383, all at P<0.05). The outcome showed a good consistency in the posterior subcapsular cataractous eyes between the two measuring methods, with the 95% limitation of agreement (LoA) from -0.21 to 0.18 mm.However, there were poor consistencies between the two measuring methods in the nuclear and cortical cataractous eyes, with the 95% LoA from -0.64 to 0.43 mm and from -0.50 to 0.41 mm, respectively.Poor consistencies also were seen in grade Ⅱ, Ⅲ, Ⅳ nuclear cataractous eyes between the two measuring methods, and the 95% LoA were -0.31 to 0.22 mm, -0.32 to 0.24 mm and -1.09 to 0.62 mm, respectively.\nThere are differences in measuring LT of different types of cataractous eyes between immersion A-scan ultrasound and Lenstar optical biometry. The measuring values are higher by immersion A-scan ultrasound than those by Lenstar optical biometry, suggesting that the measurement of immersion A-scan ultrasound for LT of different types and nuclear hardness of cataractous eyes should correct the ultrasound speed parameters.\nBiometry/instrumentation; Cataract/diagnosis; Cataract/ultrasonography; Optical devices; Lens thickness\nXue Wenchen\nClinical College of Ophthalmology of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300020, China\nTianjin Eye Hospital, Tianjin Key Lab of Ophthalmology and Vision Science, Tianjin Eye Institute, Tianjin 300020, China\nMark Kac's First Publication: A Translation of \"O nowym sposobie rozwiązywania równań stopnia trzeciego\" – Obtaining a Copy of the Original Article | Mathematical Association of America\nHome » MAA Publications » Periodicals » Convergence » Mark Kac's First Publication: A Translation of \"O nowym sposobie rozwiązywania równań stopnia trzeciego\" – Obtaining a Copy of the Original Article\n‹ Mark Kac's First Publication: A Translation of \"O nowym sposobie rozwiązywania równań stopnia trzeciego\" – Background to the Kac Publication up Mark Kac's First Publication: A Translation of \"O nowym sposobie rozwiązywania równań stopnia trzeciego\" – The English Translation ›\nA clue to the whereabouts of the article appears in a book by Daniel Kalman [2009, 79–82], which presents Kac's solution. Clearly, the author had seen the original article, or something very close to it. In email he told me that his discussion had been based on an unpublished paper [Roy n.d.] by Ranjan Roy of Beloit College in Wisconsin. Correspondence with Prof. Roy confirmed that he had once had a copy of the Kac article, but that he could not find either it or even his own paper cited by Prof. Kalman! He added that he had obtained a scan of the original article from Prof. Joel E. Cohen of Rockefeller University, one of the world's experts on population biology and a close friend of Kac's. The reminiscences that became Kac's autobiography [Kac 1985] were largely drawn from stories he told Prof. Cohen, tape recorder in hand, as they walked together through the halls at Rockefeller.\nProf. Cohen very kindly responded to email, though the pandemic had largely shut down normal life and he was not in New York City. A week or two later, he braved the virus to return to his office, and sent a scan, drawing attention to two small penciled remarks to ensure they were not overlooked. On the magazine's title page, Kac had written, \"See how bright I was when I was 15–16! M K\". And at the start of his article, there is an addendum, \"\\(m\\neq n\\)!\".\nFigure 2.

Great Expectations: Expect to feel overwhelmed and know that you are not alone. You've been hearing about college for years and now you're here. College can be one of the best times of your life but it can also be one of the most difficult. New friends, new home, new classes, new routine... exciting and overwhelming at the same time. If you experience feelings of sadness and loneliness, don't worry-these feelings are normal and usually pass within the first few months of school. Get involved in campus activities, use social media to help stay connected with your friends and family back home, and form study groups.\n2. Roommates: You may have never had to share such a small space with someone before-let alone a perfect stranger! Living with others can be challenging. Work through conflicts by regularly communicating with your roommate(s) and setting rules for the room or suite that everyone can agree on. You and your roommate don't have to be best friends; the important thing to remember is to respect one another.\nKnee Replacement in Simi Valley | Simi Valley Knee Replacement Surgery\nServices Orthopedic Care Joint Replacement Knee Replacement\nKnee Replacement in Simi Valley\nDebilitating knee pain can make even simple, everyday actions like walking virtually unbearable.

Williams, Ph.D., R.N.\nMeet the Expert – Michelle Williams, Ph.D, R.N.\nMy name is Michelle Y. Williams. I'm the new Executive Director at Stanford Health Care, Office of Research, Patient Care Services. I earned my doctorate degree in nursing science from the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee (UWM) in 2019. My dissertation research consisted of a secondary analysis of the Stanford University Chronic Disease Self-Management Program national study (2010), which was led by Dr. Kate Lorig, Professor Emeritus, Medicine, Stanford University, and her colleagues. Dr. Lorig served as my sponsor, during my pre-doctoral studies at Stanford University (2014-2018), and later as a member of my UWM doctoral dissertation committee.\nPreviously, I worked at Kaiser Permanente (KP) (1990-2019), where I served in a variety of nursing, management, and executive level roles, including: national nursing director of technology research and innovation (a member of the national innovation & advanced technology team-reporting directly to Marilyn P. Chow, formerly Vice President, National Patient Care Services), chief nursing officer, senior regional director of health plan member services, nursing director of maternal child health, and, nursing director of quality/performance improvement and administrative services. During my KP national role, I was responsible for creating the national patient care services technology research and innovation strategy, in addition to serving as a consultant for all patient care services and nursing technology innovation projects that were funded by the organization.\nDuring my KP tenure, I led several research studies, including: the development of a novel maggot debridement protocol for urgent treatment (Urology: Case #5 in the attached article), shared leadership design and deployment (Hospital and Ambulatory Nursing), delirium assessment (ICU), pain management (organization-wide), medication adherence (organization-wide), and, diabetic screening in non-diabetic patients (Endocrinology), among others.\nFurther, I led an interprofessional team in the research exploration, design, build, validation and deployment of the KP hospital of the future, in addition to an enterprise-wide research trial in the selection of an interactive patient care technology system, collaborative creation of the national KP telehealth and telemedicine strategy, medication adherence research Med Adh Guidelines: External Group and deployment of a national Medication Adherence Grand Rounds forum that attracted more than 100 physicians, pharmacists, nurses, leaders and others annually to the Kaiser Permanente Sidney R. Garfield Healthcare Innovation Center in California; and a side-by-side comparison of a virtual worlds system and traditional approaches to clinical education (the Virtual Worlds and Traditional Clinical Education tools were created, validated as part of a joint venture with KP and Stanford University's former SUMMIT Team: Dr. LeRoy Heinrichs, professor emeritus, Dr. Patricia Youngblood, former education research director, and Dr. Parvati Dev, former director).\nEarlier in my career, I had the pleasure of working at the University of California, San Francisco, General Clinical Research Center with directors, Dr. Curtis Morris and Dr. Anthony Sebastian, by leading the design, development and deployment of two off-campus clinical trials research clinics [FDA drug approval: Essential Hypertension and Osteoporosis] in the East Bay (Sutter Health and Highland General Hospital, 1989-1992). I developed and led the two off-campus UCSF clinical trials research clinics with Dr. Roger Peeks, a Stanford University School of Medicine alumni and former dean. UCSF GCRC Essential Hypertension Clinical Trial Article\nI chose to come to Stanford Health Care because of its culture of innovation and research! I believe the entire transdisciplinary team is positioned to bolster important research initiatives across Stanford Health Care. Each professional specialty adds its unique prospective lens and collectively aid in our vision to heal humanity through science and compassion. In my new position, I will work with my colleagues in the Office of Research, Patient Care Services to identify opportunities to strengthen our infrastructure, capabilities, and services, to meet the growing interests and needs of our organization. I want to better understand how we can address chronic disease self-management, health equity; and mental health among health care professionals. Furthermore, I will partner with clinicians and researchers across Stanford Health Care, the Stanford School of Medicine, and external groups (national and global) to better understand how we can initiate, support and influence patient care and nursing research.\nIf you'd like to get in touch with Michelle, she can be reached at MicWilliams@stanfordhealthcare.org."

Many women with PCOS use ingestible complementary medicines. This systematic review examined the effect on menstrual regulation and adverse effects from randomised controlled trials.\nMethods\nRandomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared herbal or nutritional supplements to placebo or active controls in women with PCOS were eligible for inclusion. Electronic databases were searched to July 2017. Study selection and assessment of quality were conducted independently by two review authors.\nResults\nTwenty four studies (1406 women) investigating seven nutritional supplements and four herbal medicines were included. No one study was assessed as having a low risk of bias. Four trials reported on the primary endpoint menstrual regulation. There was no evidence on improved menstrual regularity for calcium plus vitamin D compared to Metformin (RR: 0.66, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.23, p = 0.19), reduced amenorrhoea for Camellia sinensis compared to placebo (RR: 0.17, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.72, p = 0.13) and no difference in the number of menses per month for Cinnamomum sp. against placebo (MD 0.05, 95% CI -0.36 to 1.36, p = 0.26).\nAdverse effects were investigated in seven studies (164 women). Mild adverse effects were found for Cinnamomum sp. compared to placebo (17 women, RR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.70, p = 0.03). No difference was found for adverse effects between inositol, B complex vitamins, vitamin D, chromium and placebo. Improved reproduction, metabolic hormones and hyperandrogenism was found for inositol and improved cholesterol for omega three fish oils.\nConclusion\nThere is no high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of nutritional supplements and herbal medicine for women with PCOS and evidence of safety is lacking. High quality trials of nutritional supplements and herbal medicines examining menstrual regulation and adverse effects in women with PCOS are needed.\nPeer Review reports\nBackground\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common female reproductive endocrine disorder [1] estimated to affect up to one in five women [2]. PCOS has broad health implications including adverse metabolic (obesity, type two diabetes, cardio vascular disease), reproductive (infertility, miscarriage, pregnancy and neonatal complications) [3, 4], and psychological (anxiety, depression and stress) [5, 6] risks. The pathogenesis is underpinned by insulin resistance [7] which affects up to 75% of lean women and up to 95% of obese women (compared to 62% in BMI matched non-POCS controls) [8]. Prevention and reduction of being overweight with lifestyle interventions is first-line evidence-based treatment [9], however the strength of evidence for lifestyle is limited by high attrition in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) [10, 11] and, as in the general population, engagement and adherence to lifestyle intervention is impacted by psychosocial and physical barriers in women with established obesity [10]. Additional treatments for PCOS symptoms include pharmaceutical agents [9] (contraceptive pills (OCP) and hypoglycaemics), but contraindications for the OCP are common in overweight women [12] and hypoglycaemic agents are associated with significant rates of unpleasant side effects [13, 14], potentially worsening women’s quality of life. Women with PCOS have been shown to seek out alternative [15] and adjunct treatments including complementary medicines (CM) to improve their health, fertility and wellbeing [16].\nThere is some evidence of positive effects in women with PCOS for ingestible CMs including nutritional supplements [17, 18] and herbal medicines [19, 20]. Women with PCOS have significantly higher levels of homocysteine and oxidative stress [21] and nutritional supplements have demonstrated efficacy in women with PCOS [18] and risk reduction for the same conditions in other populations [22]. Endocrine mechanisms of herbal medicine may improve hormone balance in PCOS and may positively effect menstural regularity [23, 24], a critial outcome of concern for women with PCOS [25]. This study aimed to synthesise the evidence of effectiveness and safety for herbal and nutritional supplements in women with PCOS.\nMethods\nRCTs that compared herbal medicines or nutritional supplements to placebo, active controls (nutritional supplements) or usual care (pharmaceutical treatment, lifestyle management) were sought. Cross-over trials were included for completeness but data from the first phase only were included in meta-analyses.\nParticipants were women aged between 18 and 44 with a diagnosis of PCOS according to the Rotterdam Criteria (2003), [26] or the National Institute for Health (NIH) [27].\nNutritional or herbal supplements were defined as herbal extracts in a single preparation and/or tablets containing vitamins, minerals or dietary derived molecules designed to improve symptoms associated with PCOS and not medically prescribed for conditions of deficiency [28].\nThe primary outcome measures were; ‘menstrual regularity’ defined as number of women with menstrual cycles of 22 to 35 days duration, number of women with amenorrhoea and number of menses per month, and ‘adverse effects’. Secondary outcomes were; secondary menstrual characteristics (ovulation, presence of a dominant follicle, ratio of luteal weeks, gonadotropin hormones), polycystic ovaries, pregnancy rates and outcomes (live births and miscarriage), hyperandrogenism (clinical and biochemical), anthropometric factors, metabolic biochemistry, PCOS associated risk factors, quality of life and anxiety and depression.\nAll published and unpublished RCTs comparing herbal medicine or nutritional supplements with active controls, usual care or placebo, in English language, were searched. Electronic databases included Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE ovidSP, CINAHL, SciVerse, EMBASE, PubMed were searched from the date of inception to July 2017. Reference lists of review articles and texts were searched by hand.\nKeywords were ‘polycystic ovary syndrome’, ‘PCOS’, ‘ovarian cysts’, ‘hyperandrogenism’, ‘hirsutism’, ‘acanthosis nigrans’, ‘acne’, ‘oligomenorrhoea’, ‘amenorrhoea’, ‘oligo-ovulation’, ‘anovulation’, ‘menstrual disorders’, ‘menstrual’, ‘ovulation’, ‘fertility’, AND ‘alternative’, ‘integrative medicine’, ‘complementary medicine’, ‘naturopathy’, ‘natural’, ‘herbal medicine’, ‘botanical medicine’ ‘phytomedicine’, ‘phytotherapy’, ‘herbs’, ‘diet’, ‘food’, ‘nutritional’, ‘nutrient’, ‘micro’, ‘dietary’, ‘vitamin’, ‘mineral’, ‘supplements’, ‘hyper-vitamin’, AND ‘randomis(z)ed. control trial’, ‘clinical trial’ and ‘RCT’.\nStudy characteristics, risk of bias and outcome data were manually extracted independently by two (of three) authors (CAS, JAA and SA) and entered onto data extraction forms adapted from the Cochrane Collaboration [29] for systematic critical appraisal. Differences of opinion were resolved by consensus. Risk of bias was assessed as high, low or unclear risk for randomization (generation of randomized schedule and allocation sequence), performance (blinding of participants), detection (blinding of outcome assessors and data analysts), attrition (reporting missing data), reporting (pre-specified and or relevant outcomes) and other areas of potential bias including factors unique to particular settings (such as study being stopped early, apparent fraudulent reporting (including the absence of declaration of funding and conflicts of interest in relation to authors affiliations) or extreme baseline imbalance) [29].\nAnalyses were conducted using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3 [30]. Dichotomous data were expressed as relative risks (RR) and normally distributed continuous data as mean differences (MD). Corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p values were calculated. Heterogeneity between studies was investigated by the I2 statistic (I2 of more than 50% was considered indicative of heterogeneity), the P value from the χ2 test and by visual inspection of the forest plots. For non-significant heterogeneity, results were pooled in a fixed effect model and the effects were adjusted using random effects where there was significant heterogeneity. If distributions were skewed and results reported as the median and range, with non-parametric tests of significance, the results were excluded from the meta- analysis. Androgens, cholesterol and triglycerides were converted to common measurements for comparison and the mean difference (MD) was calculated.\nResults\nA total of 116 records were identified through the electronic and manual searches. Following initial screening, 63 articles were retrieved for detailed evaluation (Fig. 1). Thirty two full text articles were excluded as they did not meet the inclusion criteria (detailed in Additional file 1: Table S1). Following detailed evaluation of 31 full text studies, a further seven studies were excluded due to not investigating key signs and symptoms of PCOS, not being randomised or not including participants with a clinical diagnosis (detailed in Additional file 1: Table S1). Twenty four randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria [31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54] including 1406 women.\nFig. 1\nPRISMA (flow chart) diagram\nFull size image\nIncluded studies\nDesign\nThe sample sizes ranged from 10 [43] to 283 [37]. All studies were conducted at university hospitals or clinical research centres in America [42, 43, 46, 51, 52], Australia [35], Egypt [49], Hong Kong [33], Iran [32, 40, 44, 47, 48, 50, 54], Italy [31, 34, 36,37,38], Turkey [53], United Kingdom [39] and Venezuela [41, 45].\nParticipants\nFive studies included overweight participants (BMI greater than 25) [33, 35, 44, 45, 51], and two studies included women of normal bodyweight [36, 41]. One study stratified randomization according to BMI (overweight or normal weight) [47]. Seventeen studies excluded participants with other endocrine disease [42, 46, 53, 54] and elevated serum prolactin (PRL) [31,32,33, 35, 37, 38, 41, 44, 46,47,48, 50,51,52].\nInterventions\nSeven nutritional supplements and four herbal medicines were investigated (Table 1).The treatment durations ranged from thirty days [39] to seven months [49] with most treatment durations (13 studies) of eight to twelve weeks (Table 1). Inositol was investigated in eight studies and three investigated omega three fish oils. Calcium plus vitamin D, vitamin D alone, selenium and Cinnamomum sp. were investigated in two studies and nutritional supplements B complex vitamins, chromium, and herbal medicines Camellia sinensis, Mentha spicata and Cimicifuga racemosa were investigated in single studies. Calcium plus vitamin D, B complex, inositol, selenium and Cimicifuga racemosa were compared with pharmaceutical controls (metformin and clomiphene citrate) [47,48,49,50, 53, 54].\nTable 1 Interventions: Nutritional supplements and herbal medicine\nFull size table\nOutcomes\nFour studies reported on the primary outcome, menstrual regularity [33, 42, 47, 50]. Seven trials reported on adverse effects (164 women) [41,42,43, 45, 46, 52, 53]. Seven studies reported on secondary menstrual cycle characteristics [34, 37, 38, 41, 45, 49, 50]. One trial reported on polycystic ovaries [49]. Three studies reported on pregnancy rates [47,48,49] and one on miscarriage [49]. Fourteen trials reported on the outcomes of biochemical hyperandrogenism [31, 33,34,35,36, 39,40,41,42,43, 45, 48, 51, 54]. Four trials reported on the outcomes of clinical hyperandrogenism with validated tools including the modified Ferriman Gallwey score to measure degree of hirsutism [39, 48, 50, 54], and acne with the dermatology quality of life index for health related quality of life [39]. Eight trials reported anthropometric outcomes of participants [33, 37, 38, 44, 50, 52,53,54]. Eighteen trials reported metabolic biochemistry including fasting glucose and insulin [31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38, 40,41,42,43,44,45,46, 51,52,53].\nRisk of bias for included studies\nAll 24 studies were assessed as having some risk of bias (Fig. 2). Incomplete or poor reporting by most trial authors impacted on the assessment, and consequently an unclear risk of bias for at least two characteristics was determined in 23 studies [31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52, 54]. Seven studies were found to have high risks of bias in at least three domains including performance [49,50,51, 54], detection [49, 50, 54], attrition [37, 38, 51, 53], reporting [37, 38, 50, 53] and other forms of bias [37, 38, 49,50,51, 53, 54]. Fourteen studies were at high risk for other sources of bias including nine with imbalanced baseline characteristics [31, 33, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43,44,45, 54], insufficient time to detect change [32, 34, 39], and an active control reported as placebo (placebo consisted of lecithin which is a natural source of inositol [55]) [17]. Three studies did not report the effect of high attrition (over 30%) on baseline menstrual characteristics in the test and control groups [37, 38, 42]. Twelve studies declared conflicts of interest [31, 32, 35, 36, 42, 44,45,46, 48, 49, 51, 54]. Ten studies reported no conflicts of interest and two studies reported potential conflicts of interest due to authors’ affiliations [46; 45]. Fourteen studies reported sources of study funding [32, 35, 36, 40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49, 51]. Three studies were funded with grants from the pharmaceutical industry [35, 41, 45], twelve studies were funded by university or research institute grants [32, 36, 40, 42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49, 51] and one study was funded by both pharmaceutical industry and an institute grant [45].\nFig. 2\nRisk of Bias summary\nFull size image\nEffects of interventions\nData from two trials were not included in analyses. One trial used a cross-over trial design and did not report first phase outcomes [35]; the other study reported outcomes as the median rather than the mean [33]. Where data could not be included in a meta-analysis a narrative reporting of the findings was presented.\nNutritional supplements for PCOS\nCalcium plus vitamin D\nTwo trials (78 women) compared calcium plus vitamin D with metformin for the number of women with regular menstrual cycles (21–35 days) [47, 50]. There was no evidence of an improved effect (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.23, p = 0.19, I2 0%). Adverse effects were not reported.\nSecondary outcomes\nRashidi and colleagues reported on the number ovarian cysts defined as immature follicles (diameter 5-9 mm) and pregnancy rates for calcium plus vitamin D against metformin [47]. No difference between groups was found. Tehrani and colleagues reported on BMI and hirsutism (defined as Ferriman Gallwey score over 8) [50]; no difference was found between groups.\nVitamin B complex\nOne study investigated B complex vitamins plus metformin compared with metformin alone, for 32 women [53]. Results were reported as ‘women taking Metformin’ and between group differences were not reported. No data were available for B complex vitamins on menstrual regularity. No difference for adverse events was found.\nSecondary outcomes\nFour secondary outcomes for vitamin B complex plus metformin were reported. No significant effects were found for pregnancy rates, waist to hip ratio or HOMA-IR.\nInositol (vitamin B8)\nNo trials reported on the primary outcome menstrual regularity for inositol (Table 2). Two trials (64 women) reported on adverse events for inositol [41, 45]. No adverse effects were found for inositol against placebo [41, 45].\nTable 2 Inositol for reproduction, hyperandrogenism, metabolism, anthropometry and risk factors\nFull size table\nSecondary outcomes\nSignificant benefits were found for inositol versus placebo and active controls (90 women) for the secondary outcomes of reproductive characteristics and hyperandrogenism (Fig. 3) and (Table 2).\nFig. 3\nMeta-analysis inositol versus placebo for total testosterone in women with PCOS\nFull size image\nThe number of ovulations was significantly higher for women taking inositol (two studies, 64 women, RR 3.13, 95% CI 1.68 to 5.83, p < 0.001). Two trials reported on a subgroup of women wanting to conceive (84 women) [37, 38] and a third trial included women preparing to undergo medically assisted fertility treatment (50 women) [31]. Meta analyses of these three studies (134 women) demonstrated pregnancy rates were significantly higher for women taking inositol compared to controls (RR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 6.5, p = 0.02).\nSignificant benefits were found for the secondary outcomes of total testosterone, (five studies, 192 women, MD 0.99 nmol/l, 95% CI -1.54 to −0.44, p < 0.001) [34, 36, 41, 45, 54] (Fig. 3) and androstenidione (four studies, 132 women, MD 3.59 nmol/l, 95% CI -4.6 to −2.6, p < 0.001) [34, 36, 41, 45] and SHBG (two studies, 122 women, MD 40.67 nmol/l, 25.8 to 55.5, p < 0.01) [41, 45]. No significant benefit was found for free testosterone following treatment with inositol [34, 36, 41, 45] or for clinical hyperandrogenism (Ferriman Gallwey score) for inositol compared with metformin [54].\nSignificant benefits were found for fasting glucose (four trials, 132 participants, MD-1.17, 95% CI -1.72 to −0.63, p < 0.01), [34, 36, 41, 45]; fasting insulin (four trials, 132 participants, MD −2.7 μU/ml, 95% CI -3.9 to −1.5, p < 0.01) [34, 36, 41, 45] and reduced insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (two trials, 76 participants, MD -1.3, 95% CI -1.6 to −1.0, p < 0.01) [31, 36] (Table 2). Significant heterogeneity was found for the two trials investigating inositol for HOMA-IR (I2 = 91%, p < 0.001) and effects were adjusted using a random effects model. Study heterogeneity was likely due to different characteristics of participants at baseline (normal weight [36] and overweight [31]), different doses of inositol and types of controls (1200 g per day versus placebo [36] and 2 g plus folic acid versus folic acid alone [31]).\nSignificant benefits were found for the secondary outcome waist to hip ratio (two studies, 64 women, MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.03 to −0.01, p = 0.01) [41, 45]. Mixed results were found for inositol with BMI in five trials [31, 36, 41, 45, 54] (Table 2). One trial showed significant improvements in BMI [36], whilst three others found no significant difference between groups [31, 45, 54]. A fifth trial found significantly increased BMI for women taking inositol compared to placebo controls however this study included lean participants and mean BMI at endpoint remained within normal BMI range (22.3 ± 0.3) [41]. Significant heterogeneity of trials prevented meta-analysis (I2 = 89%, p < 0.00001). The high heterogeneity may be explained clinically with variable baseline BMI categories of participants ranging from normal [36, 41, 54], overweight [31, 54] and obese [45]. Dose variation of inositol may have also contributed to study heterogeneity with daily doses of 600 mg [41], 1200 mg [36, 45] and 2 g [31] [36]) and durations of treatment for six [41, 45] and twelve weeks [31, 36, 54]) [54]. Significant benefits were found for total cholesterol (two trials, 64 women, MD 0.56 mmol/l, 95% CI -1.07 to −0.04, p = 0.04) [41, 45] and triglycerides (two trials, 64 women, MD 31.6 mg.dl, 95% CI -61.1 to −2.0, p = 0.04) [41, 45] following treatment with inositol compared to placebo controls. Reduced inflammation (c-reactive protein (CRP)) was found for inositol compared to metformin in one study (MD -2.2, 95% CI -3.57 to −0.83, p < 0.01) [54].\nChromium supplements\nOne small study reported on chromium compared to placebo in ten women with PCOS [43]. The study did not report on menstrual regulation. No adverse events were reported for either chromium or placebo. Five secondary outcomes free testosterone, total testosterone, ovulation, FSH and LH were reported. No significant treatment effects were found for any outcomes.\nVitamin D\nTwo RCTs examined vitamin D supplements compared with a placebo in 78 women with PCOS [32, 46]. Heterogeneity of studies was not significant (I2 = 0%) and data were pooled for analyses. The effects of vitamin D on menstrual regulation were not reported. No adverse effects were found in one study [46].\nSecondary outcomes\nNo significant treatment effect was found for vitamin D compared with placebo for metabolic hormones including fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance or insulin sensitivity [32, 46]. One study including 28 women found no evidence of improvements for vitamin D compared to placebo for free and total testosterone, cholesterol and high and low density lipoproteins triglycerides and inflammation (CRP) [46].\nOmega three fish oils\nTwo studies investigated omega 3 supplements against placebo in 95 women [44, 51]. Neither study reported on menstrual regulation or adverse effects.\nSecondary outcomes\nA significant effect was found for the risk marker total cholesterol in women receiving omega 3 fish oils compared to placebo controls (two trials, 95 women, −0.49 mmol, 95% CI -0.62 to −0.35, p < 0.001) [44, 51] (Fig. 4).\nFig. 4\nMeta-analysis omega three fish oils for cholesterol in women with PCOS\nFull size image\nNo evidence of an effect was found for free testosterone or SHBG [51], waist to hip ratio [44] or for inflammation (CRP) [44]. Findings were mixed for some secondary outcomes including triglycerides, HDL and LDL [44, 51], BMI [44, 51], fasting glucose and insulin resistance [44, 51]. Clinical heterogeneity was likely due to the dose of omega three. One trial received treatment of 3.5 g (EPA 258 mg and DHA 242 mg) for six weeks [51], which was less than the other trial where women received 4 g (EPA 720 mg and DHA 480 mg) over eight weeks and additionally due to wide variation in mean BMI at baseline. Both trials included women with a BMI that ranged between 25 and 40–45 however the mean BMI for women in one trial was in the overweight category (BMI 28) [51] compared to morbidly obese (BMI 36) in the other [44]. Significant effects were found for morbidly obese women taking the higher dose of fish oils [44] for fasting glucose (−0.33 mmol/l, 95% CI -0.26 to −0.40, p < 0.001), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (−1.23, 95% CI -1.6 to −0.86, p < 0.001) and reduced LDLs (−0.88, 95% CI -1.04 to −0.72, p < 0.01) [44].\nSelenium\nTwo studies investigated selenium supplements against placebo in 109 women [40, 48]. One investigated added metformin in both study groups [48]. Neither menstrual regulation nor adverse effects were investigated in either study.\nSecondary outcomes\nA significant effect was found in one study for selenium against placebo in 53 women for fasting glucose (MD 4.66 mg/dl, 95%CI 3.23 to 6.09, p < 0.00001), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (MD 0.24 95%CI 0.06 to 0.42, p = 0.008), total testosterone (MD 0.18 ng/ml, 95%CI 0.09 to 0.27, p < 0.0001), SHBG (MD 12.80 nmol/l, 95% CI 6.22 to 19.38, p < 0.0001) and FAI (MD 3.93, 95% CI 3.54 to 4.32, p < 0.00001) [40]. No effect was found for fasting insulin. Ravazi and colleagues [48] examined selenium in addition to pharmaceutical management (metformin) against metformin plus placebo in 64 women. No evidence of an additive effect was found for free testosterone, inflammation or pregnancy rates.\nHerbal medicines for PCOS\nOne trial reported on Camellia sinensis (green tea) capsules compared with placebo for menstrual regularity [33]. Chan and colleagues (2006) investigated the proportion of amenorrheic women over a three month period (34 women) [33]. No difference was found between groups. Adverse effects were not investigated.\nSecondary outcomes\nChan and colleagues (2006) reported on secondary outcomes however data were presented as median differences and the interquartile range and analysed for changes over time. Consequently data were not suitable for inclusion in analyses in this review [33]. No significant differences in median values over time were found for women taking Camellia sinensis or placebo for testosterone, SHBG, FAI, androstenidione, FSH, LH, BMI, waist to hip ratio, insulin, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides HDL or LDL.\nCimicifuga Racemosa\nOne study examined the combination of Cimicifuga racemosa and the pharmaceutical agent Clomiphene citrate (clomiphene) against clomiphene alone in 194 women [49]. Menstrual regulation or adverse effects were not reported.\nSecondary outcomes\nA significant treatment effect was found for the combination group for reduced days to ovulation (MD −3 days, 95% CI -3.51 to −2.49, p < 0.01), pregnancy rates (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.19 to 3.31, p < 0.01), FSHmIU/l (MD 0.40, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.58, p < 0.01), LH mIU/l (MD -2.3, 95% CI -2.55 to −2.05, p < 0.01), and reduced miscarriage (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.74, p = 0.36).\nCinnamomum sp.\nNo evidence of a menstrual regulation effect was found in one study investigating Cinnamomum sp. compared with placebo in 17 women [42]. Four non-serious adverse events were reported for Cinnamomum sp. [42]. These included headache, heartburn, menstrual cramps, nausea and diarrhoea. No adverse events were reported in the second study by Wang and colleagues [52]. Use of a variable dose may explain the different findings for adverse effects; one investigated 1500 mg of Cinnamomum sp. per day over six months [42] and the other 1000 mg per day over eight weeks [52].\nSecondary outcomes\nTwo studies reported on metabolic hormones following treatment with Cinnamomum sp. compared to placebo [42, 52]. Primary data were not reported by Wang and colleagues and between groups could not be examined [52]. No evidence of a treatment effect for Cinnamomum sp. was found for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) or insulin sensitivity (QUICKI) [42].\nMentha Spicata\nNo data on primary outcomes were reported.\nSecondary outcomes\nA significant treatment effect was found for Mentha spicata compared to Matricaria recutita (chamomile) tea for reduction in total testosterone in 41 women (MD 0.18 nmol/l, 95% CI -0.34 to −0.02, p = 0.03) [39]. No significant treatment effects were found for free testosterone, hirsutism or the dermatology index quality of life assessment.\nDiscussion\nThis systematic review included 24 randomised controlled trials of 1406 women with PCOS. Seven nutritional supplements and four herbal medicines were investigated and meta-analyses were reported for calcium plus vitamin D, Cinnamomum sp., inositol (vitamin B8), omega three fish oils and vitamin D. Menstrual regularity, a defining feature of critical interest to women with PCOS [25], was examined in only four studies and no significant treatment effect compared to controls was found. However secondary outcomes of time to ovulation, ovulation rates, hyperandrogenism, reproductive and metabolic hormones, waist to hip ratio, cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly improved by inositol and total cholesterol was significantly lowered by omega three fish oils compared to controls. Adverse effects were reported in seven studies for four nutritional supplements and one herbal medicine. Mild adverse effects were found for Cinnamomum sp. There were no long term investigations of safety.\nFindings for the primary outcome, menstrual regulation\nThis review found no single nutritional supplement or herbal medicine significantly improved the primary outcome, menstrual regulation. The oral contraceptive pill (OCP) is first line pharmaceutical treatment for menstrual regularity in women with PCOS [9], however it is contraindicated in women with increased cardiovascular risks [12, 15] and women with PCOS have reported preferences for effective alternatives [15]. Metformin is an effective alternative however women with PCOS have reported high rates of unpleasant side effects [13].\nThere is low quality evidence from RCTs for menstrual regulation included in this review. Trials were characterized by a high risk of selection, performance and detection biases and an unclear risk of reporting bias. Evidence from methodologically sound RCTs is needed to examine the reliability of findings for calcium plus vitamin D compared with metformin for menstrual regulation.\nChan (2006) and colleagues found a treatment effect on the primary outcome in a sub-analysis investigating Camellia sinensis with a lower proportion of amenorrheic women at twelve weeks for women taking Camellia sinensis compared to placebo controls, however differences between groups were not significant [33]. Findings were limited by the small sub-group sample size (only 14 women), the study was underpowered for the number of amenorrheic women and was assessed as low quality due to not reporting baseline characteristics of subgroups and for reporting on medians rather than means.\nThe findings of this review contribute to the evidence for Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) for oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea in women with PCOS [23]. Traditional Chinese herbal formulations are another form of ingestible complementary medicine of interest to women with PCOS [16]. In that systematic review which included Chinese and English language papers, only one small, low quality study investigated menstrual cyclicity outcomes for CHM and found an improved menstrual regulation response from the oral contraceptive pill (Diane 35) when combined with CHM compared to Diane 35 alone (RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.06 to 6.39, p = 0.04). We have some low grade evidence to add to women’s treatment decisions for menstrual regularity; calcium plus vitamin D, compared to metformin does not appear to provide any further benefits on this outcome. We agree that the evidence for ingestible CMs for menstrual regulation is poor quality and inconclusive due to the absence of findings from methodologically sound clinical studies.\nFindings for the nutritional supplement inositol\nThis review provides some support for a therapeutic role of inositol. As an essential structural component of cell membranes, inositol is needed for cell membrane signalling functions including those involving neurological signalling in the brain, second messenger systems and insulin signal transduction. Impaired insulin signalling in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue has a pathogenic role in conditions of insulin resistance [56, 57]. It has been proposed that ovarian theca cells of women with PCOS remain sensitive to insulin despite insulin resistance, and theca cell androgen production continues through an alternative insulin signal transduction system [58]. Evidence for a range of doses of inositol suggests therapeutic supplementation may improve metabolic profile in women with PCOS in addition to reduced biochemical hyperandrogenism and improved ovulation and pregnancy rates. However, only one small study included in this review examined live birth rates and no significant improvements were found compared to controls. As healthy, live birth outcomes are the primary goal of all interventions for women with PCOS seeking treatment for infertility there is a need for more high quality randomised controlled trials to report on this outcome. Adverse effects of inositol were examined in only two studies. Despite the likely low risks [59] this systematic review found no long term investigations assessing safety, and the evidence of safety is not established in women with PCOS.\nThe findings of this review differ with the systematic review of hypoglycaemic interventions for women with PCOS [14]. Tang and colleagues found no evidence for inositol compared with placebo in two studies for improved ovulation in 327 women (Odds Ratio 5.38, 95% CI 0.70 to 41.31, I2 81%) [38, 45], or for lowered androgens, metabolic markers or blood lipids in 44 women [45]. Differences in our findings may be explained by the variable study inclusion criteria and the number of studies included in analyses. Tang and colleagues included studies only investigating the d-chiro isomer form of inositol against placebo or no treatment [14]. This present review included studies investigating any isometric form of inositol and active controls.\nWell-being and quality of life outcomes\nWomen are likely to use nutritional supplements and herbal medicines in addition to conventional pharmaceutical management possibly to improve well-being and quality of life [16, 60]. No studies investigated well-being or quality of life (QoL) outcomes and few studies examined safety for the use of nutritional and herbal supplements in conjunction with pharmaceutical treatment. Further evidence is needed to inform women’s treatment decisions and to assess the clinical usefulness of nutritional supplements and herbal medicine for improved well-being and quality of life in women with PCOS.\nLimitations\nThe inclusion of an English language excluded non-English language research and indexations. Herbal medicine has a high prevalence of use amongst non-English speaking cultures and this review was limited by its omission of non-English language research and databases.\nOther limitations of this review include the poor quality of evidence, the small number of nutritional supplements and herbal medicine interventions, the absence of QoL and well-being outcomes and lack of long term investigations of safety. Key words did not include individual nutrient and herbal possibilities or complex herbal formulations and evidence may have been missed. In addition, methodological weaknesses lead to the exclusion of many studies and the authors did not seek further information from researchers of studies where the median rather than the mean was reported. Further research using rigorous RCT design is needed to inform findings of this systematic review.\nA narrow inclusion criteria of only RCTs that examined the three diagnostic features of PCOS were specified for this review. Further literature reviews with inclusion criteria of other clinical outcomes such as fertility, anthropometric or psychological outcomes may strengthen the findings found here and better inform clinicians and women’s treatment decisions.\nConclusion\nThere is no high quality evidence to support the effectiveness of nutritional supplements and herbal medicine for PCOS symptoms and evidence of safety and is lacking. However for two nutritional supplements, there was some low quality evidence that suggests women with PCOS may benefit from inositol and omega three fish oil supplements. Further research is needed.\nAbbreviations\nBMI:\nBody mass index\nCHM:\nChinese herbal medicine\nCI:\nConfidence interval\nCM:\nComplementary medicine\nCRP:\nC reactive protein\nD3:\nCholecalciferol\nDHA:\nDocosahexaenoic Acid\nEPA:\nEicosapentaenoic acid\nFAI:\nFree androgen index\nFSH:\nFollicle stimulating hormone\nHDL:\nHigh density lipoprotein\nHOMA-IR:\nHomoeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance\nIU:\nInternational units\nLDL:\nLow density lipoprotein\nLH:\nLuteinizing hormone\nMD:\nMean difference\nNIH:\nNational Institute of Health\nOCP:\nOral contraceptive pill\nPCOS:\nPolycystic ovary syndrome\nPRISMA:\nPreferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses\nPRL:\nProlactin\nQUICKI:\nQuantitative insulin sensitivity check index\nRCT:\nRandomized control trial\nRR:\nRelative risk\nSHBG:\nSex hormone binding globulin\nsp.:\nSpecies\nReferences\nESHRE.

Mortality-related default risk is a key factor in this result, and the age effect is larger for subgroups with higher mortality risks, such as older individuals, men and individuals who live in low-life-expectancy countries; these results hold when age and the interest rate spread are compared. The author concludes that older individuals systematically face higher barriers to credit access because mortality risk is priced in credit markets.\nThe Procyclicality of FDIC Deposit Insurance Premiums | Jennifer Rhee, FDIC\n(Rhee co-authored the paper with Ryan Hess, Stanford University)\nPoster | Video\nThe authors assess the procyclical effects of FDIC insurance premiums using changes in premium rate schedules that regulators set during the financial crisis. They are able to examine the effect of changes in deposit insurance premiums that are plausibly exogenous to the performance of an individual bank through use of\ninternal FDIC data that allow them to remove the effect driven by endogenous factors. They document empirically a procyclical effect of deposit insurance premiums on bank lending during the financial crisis and show that community banks are disproportionately affected by this mechanism.\nThe presentations of the authors who presented their papers on site at the conference will be recorded and will be posted shortly to the conference website.\nConference Conclusions | ASPE\nConference Report: Increasing Organ Donation and Transplantation: The Challenge of Evaluation. Conference Conclusions\nADRD Summit 2016 Report to the National Advisory Neurological Disorders and Stroke Council Evaluation of HHS Delivery System Reform Efforts and Affordable Care Act Provisions: Consolidated Evaluation Design Recommendations Meeting the Challenge of Serving People With Disabilities: A Resource Guide for Assessing the Performance of Managed Care Organizations Evaluating Privatized Child Welfare Programs: A Guide for Program Managers National Research Summit on Care, Services and Supports for Persons with Dementia and Their Caregivers: Final Summit Report\nThe conference offered a diverse range of organ donation activities and evaluations with performance indicators of varying proximity to organ donation rates. Conference deliberations recognized the practical challenges of evaluating programs in a wide variety of health care and social environments, including the resources needed to implement rigorous evaluations. Organizers of the conference sought to aid program managers and researchers to understand what might be needed to improve evaluations of their programs and better demonstrate what does and does not yield greater organ donation.\nPresentations on the first day focused primarily on pre-event activities, i.e., public awareness and educational activities, and the challenges of evaluating such programs relative to measures of organ donation. Presentations on the second day focused on post-event activities that tend to be more proximal to the \"bull's-eye\" of performance indicators (Exhibit 3), but still face significant methodological challenges. Although the specific evaluation methodologies may be different for pre- and post-event activities, each type of activity shares similar challenges of evaluation. A distillation of the conclusions made by conference participants regarding program evaluation is as follows.\nEvaluations of the impacts of program interventions need to be more rigorously designed in order to determine the causal links between the interventions and the appropriate performance indicators. More rigorous evaluation design will rule out factors that may confound causal effects, e.g., differences in geographical or socioeconomic attributes that may affect performance indicators rather than the interventions themselves. Among the design attributes that contribute to establishing causality are:\ncareful identification of populations or target groups (including stratification into subgroups as appropriate)\ncontemporaneous and otherwise well-matched control groups\nrandom assignment of interventions\nsample sizes of adequate size to detect any true causal relationships between interventions and changes in performance indicators.\nResearchers must demonstrate an impact on the intended target population and a change in the associated performance indicators. The performance indicator(s) chosen to measure the impact of a program intervention should be as proximal as possible to organ donation rate. Clearly, making the causal connection to organ donation rates is difficult or impractical for many programs, particularly those involving pre-event interventions. To the extent that causal links between less proximal pre-event measures such as measures of public awareness or number of people registered as organ donors, or post-event measures such as referral rates or request rates, and organ donation rate can be demonstrated, pre-event measures would be more useful.\nThe target groups of evaluation and the timeframes of evaluation need to be commensurate with the chain of events or other stages of progress from initial program intervention through organ donation and follow-up. For example, programs intended to change the behavior of younger people may have to be evaluated over longer periods of time and include their family members to determine if the intervention affected donation-related behaviors.\nPotentially useful evaluative paradigms such as the transtheoretical model of behavior change, and tools such as survey instruments that have been developed or applied in other fields should be validated in organ donation settings, e.g., post-event in hospitals, and in representative populations, e.g., with donor and non-donor families.\nTo improve their \"generalizability\" or external validity, program evaluations should be conducted in multiple geographic regions and socioeconomic groups.\nOrgan donation researchers could benefit from increased collaboration with researchers in other fields including evaluation design experts, statisticians, health services researchers, health economists, and other academic researchers. For example, statisticians can provide assistance with regard to \"power calculations\" to determine adequate sample sizes and identify appropriate statistical tests, e.g., using non-parametric statistics and multivariate analysis. Economists can provide assistance with identifying and quantifying the direct and indirect costs of programs and conducting cost analyses. Engaging such experts in these efforts will strengthen the longer-term evaluation capacity in the organ donation community.\nGiven considerable tradeoffs in the costs and outcomes of programs for improving organ donation, cost-benefit analysis and related economic analyses should be used to compare programs to improve organ donation and to demonstrate their value relative to other types of health care programs.\nProgram evaluations should not overlook what one presenter called \"formative evaluation.\" That is, programs should specify implementation milestones and provide the means to measure progress against these.\nOrgan donation programs should increase collaboration in evaluation. Researchers should become more familiar with other programs in similar areas and evaluations, including those reported in the literature and other sources. Organizations involved in efforts to improve organ donation should engage in larger-scale collaborative efforts to plan and implement programs, e.g., through multicenter evaluations, registries, and related data collection and sharing efforts. More efforts need to be undertaken to refine pre- and post-event measures, and to further establish causal links between these measures and organ donation rates. Some of these efforts can be coordinated at a national level, e.g., through organizations like UNOS, and other nationally active organizations.\nEvaluation findings should be used to improve the programs that were evaluated and disseminated more widely for incorporation into other efforts to improve or ensure the quality of organ donation programs.\nVertex Pharmaceuticals | Responsibility | Grants and Giving\nResponsibility Grants and Giving\nVertex and the Vertex Foundation fund a variety of programs in the countries in which we operate to educate health care professionals, strengthen scientific research, encourage innovation and fulfill unmet needs in the community.\nVertex grants and funding opportunities\nVertex is committed to supporting programs and initiatives that advance the knowledge and care for people around the world with cystic fibrosis and other serious diseases where we focus our research.

Worse, half that number are unaware of how compromised their health really is.\nWhat this reveals, researchers assert, is that acetic acid can \"turn on\" trigger genes that initiate the enzymes ability to break down fat, which prevents weight gain. It also helps you feel full.\nSeveral test tube studies show that vinegar can kill cancer cells. Authority Nutrition cites several studies; one in particular in Japan used several types of fermented vinegars to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in leukemia cells.\nA total of 2552 hospitalized, unrelated study patients along with 1894 controls with written informed consent were selected and obtained through various hospitals including Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, Bengaluru, India. In addition, a total of 98 registered unrelated patients and their family members were obtained as we previously described (5, 41). The institutional review boards of the study centers approved the study protocols.\nA standard international protocol was followed in diagnosing the cases, as we described previously (5), and the details of the baseline characteristics of the patients are given in table S1 (A and D). Briefly, individuals were diagnosed with HCM based on the following conventional criteria proposed by American Society of Echocardiography:\n1) LV hypertrophy of ≥15 mm on two-dimensional echocardiography in the absence of another disease that could account for the hypertrophy.\n2) LV septal to posterior wall thickness ratio of more than 1.3 in the absence of hypertension that could account for hypertrophy.\n3) Nonobstructive HCM was defined as a pressure gradient of ≤30 mmHg at rest and after provocation. Patients with a pressure gradient of >30 mmHg at rest or after provocation were classified as obstructive HCM.\n4) Any electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities along with the above echo-positive individuals: LV hypertrophy (Romhilt-Estes score, ≥4), Q-waves (a duration of >0.04 s and/or a depth of >1/4 of ensuring R wave in at least two leads), and marked repolarization abnormalities (T-wave inversion in at least two leads). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was defined as three or more ventricular extra systoles at a rate of ≥120 beats/min, lasting less than﻿﻿ 30 s.\n5) Family history was considered positive if anyone first degree relative had a clinical diagnosis of HCM.\n6) For selective patients, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed with the standard protocols including Cine, steady-state free precession (SSFP), T1-weighted, and T2-weighted imaging, followed by gadolinium administration and postgadolinium for late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) sequences using 1.5-T clinical system (Ingenia, Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands). For LGE imaging, the patient were administered with an intravenous injection of 0.2 mmol/kg of body weight gadolinium-based contrast reagent at 1 to 2 ml/s. Ten minutes after injection time, LGE images were acquired in the continuous short-axis view using an inversion-recovery gradient-recalled echo sequence using a manually selected optimal inversion time to null the signal from normal myocardium.\nThese days, it is common to find regular cannabis users looking for new cannabidiol products online.

Advanced research is underway to establish the sound benefits of CBD oil and other CBD products on epilepsy cases.\nConclusion\nInsomnia, anxiety, and stress are among the fastest increasing mental health conditions in 2021. Fortunately, research reports have established the efficacy of CBD vape oils in treating them. You may want to discover the relaxing and sleep-inducing effects of CBD products and oils for yourself. Log into Miami Rave to check out its extensive catalog of hemp flower CBD products and their benefits.\nDICE and AVD are used in concert to automatically segment lesion areas: DICE overlaps predicted and actual lesions, while AVD identifies the differences in volume between them. The results are consistent with doctors’ manual sketching.\nThe screening system is then able to automatically identify and digitally segment lung lesions and measure lesion volume. This allows the rapid diagnosis of symptomatic patients carrying the COVID-19 virus – up to three days faster than other testing methodologies.\nAccording to Huawei CLOUD Healthcare Manager Mr Zhang Shaowei, “The components of the EIHealth platform use different AI techniques, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Knowledge Graph Learning to power a screening system which can autonomously and holistically integrate the lessons learned by our medical professionals.”\nThis process also boasts an impressively high accuracy rate, correctly identifying carriers 98% of the time. Using this technique, doctors can delegate the task of reading CT scans to the AI and focus instead on the important work of treating patients.\nFurthermore, for confirmed cases in hospitals, the AI-Assisted Patient Screening system can quickly perform registration and quantitative analysis on the data acquired over multiple rechecks of the CT scans, thereby helping doctors evaluate patients’ conditions and the impact of targeted drug treatments.\nAs Mr Zhang notes, “The system does not fully replace the work that doctors do, but enhances their capabilities by adding an additional line of defense in the diagnostic process.”\nHuawei CLOUD has already deployed the AI-Assisted Patient Screening system in 60 hospitals across the globe, including Malaysia, Thailand, Italy, and Ecuador.\nIn Malaysia, Huawei is working with the Ministry of Health to deploy the system in the Sungai Buloh Hospital (state of Selangor). Dr Yun Sii Ing, Head of Department for Clinical Radiology at the hospital, recently stated that, “[…] This equipment (…) will help save lives by greatly reducing the risk of infection and enabling medical personnel to perform their duties better and faster.”\nIn Ecuador, the General Hospital of South Quito was connected to Huawei’s AI system, enabling diagnoses just 14 hours after its launch. Otto Sonnenholzner, Vice President of Ecuador, took to social media to thank Huawei for making Ecuador the first Latin America territory with AI-powered diagnostics.\nMedical Blogs May Threaten Patient Privacy - Consumer Health News | HealthDay\nMedical Blogs May Threaten Patient Privacy\nMore than half revealed data for easy IDs, lacked basic ethical standards, study finds\nTHURSDAY, Aug. 7, 2008 (HealthDay News) -- Blogs written by medical professionals may pose a threat to patient privacy, because the authors of the blogs may inadvertently reveal patient information, says a U.S. study that's the first to examine the issue.\nThe researchers analyzed the contents of 271 medical blogs and found that 56.8 percent contained enough information to reveal the author's identity.\nAlthough obvious violations of patient privacy are rare, supposedly anonymous medical bloggers who provide information about their location, subspecialty or other personal details may reveal their identity to blog readers, noted Dr. Tara Lagu, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholar, and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania.\nIn some cases, patients described in medical blogs may be able to identify themselves, the researchers said. For example, three of the blogs in the study had recognizable photos of patients, including one with an extensive description of the patient and links to photos.\nThe researchers also found that some of the medical blogs allowed advertisements, and some promoted health -care products within the blog text. None of the bloggers who described products within the text adhered to medical ethics standards of providing information on conflicts of interest, or whether payment was received for promotion of the products.\nThe study was published online in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.\n\"While many medical blogs provide valuable information to the public, are respectful in tone and are written anonymously, others pose a threat to patient privacy and have the potential to threaten the integrity of the medical profession,\" Lagu said in a journal news release.\n\"Unfortunately, no professional organization has taken the initiative to provide guidance on this issue. As the number of medical blogs grows, professional organizations, medical educators, and the blogging community must address the challenge of this new medium by setting guidelines and standards for what is appropriate,\" Lagu said.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has more about patient privacy.\nSOURCE: Journal of General Internal Medicinenews release, July 23, 2008\nConsumer News Products Language English News types News Topics Computers / Internet: Misc.

It is an enzyme, which means it speeds up chemical changes when the body converts sugar to energy.\nThe G6PD enzyme is found in all the body's cells, but is especially important in red blood cells. These are the cells that contain hemoglobin and carry oxygen throughout the body. The G6PD enzyme protects the red blood cells from harmful chemicals or toxins, which can accumulate in your body during certain illnesses or after taking some medicines.\nPeople with G6PD deficiency do not have enough G6PD enzyme to neutralize some chemicals or toxins. Normally, there are only tiny amounts of toxins in the body, and it is usually not a problem for the G6PD enzyme to make them harmless.\nIf strong chemical products are not neutralized, they can damage the hemoglobin inside red blood cells. A build-up of toxins or chemicals can cause the red blood cells to break apart and be destroyed. This makes the person anemic (reduced levels of hemoglobin and red blood cells). Sometimes the anemia can happen very quickly, as if the person suddenly lost a lot of blood after an accident.\nWhen people with G6PD deficiency take these medications, the toxic products that form in the body can damage and destroy their red blood cells.\nThe process of the red blood cells with hemoglobin being destroyed is called hemolysis. This may lead to severe anemia and can cause jaundice from the build-up of hemoglobin breakdown products in the blood. Sometimes infants who experience jaundice have G6PD deficiency.\nPeople with G6PD deficiency will receive from their healthcare provider a detailed list of medicines and substances that are known to cause problems with hemolysis. Once the cause of hemolysis is removed, the hemolysis usually stops within a short period.\nCause of G6PD Deficiency\nG6PD is a genetic condition that is caused by an alteration (mutation) in the G6PD gene. This mutation prevents the normal production of the enzyme. The gene is passed on in families in an X-linked recessive pattern. This means that the gene that codes for the G6PD enzyme is located on the X-chromosome; males have one X chromosome and females have two. When a male inherits a gene for G6PD that is not functioning properly, he will have G6PD deficiency. When a female inherits a gene for G6PD deficiency she is referred to as a carrier because she has a second copy of the gene that often can compensate for the altered gene. Female carriers may or may not experience symptoms of G6PD deficiency. Carriers of G6PD deficiency have a 50% chance of passing the gene on to each of their children. Each son of a carrier has a 50% chance of having G6PD deficiency and each daughter has a 50% chance of being a carrier. Men with G6PD deficiency do not pass the gene on to any of their sons; however, all (100%) of their daughters are carriers. Often a mother has no symptoms and has no way of knowing that she is a carrier of G6PD deficiency. Carrier testing in families who are known to have G6PD deficiency is available if desired.\nG6PD deficiency can occur in a person from any ethnic group. In the United States it most commonly occurs in people of African American, Mediterranean (Italian, Greek), Southeast Asian, or Middle Eastern descent.\nThe only way to know if a person has G6PD deficiency is with a special blood test. Remember, G6PD deficiency is not usually a chronic problem except in rare circumstances (see section below under \"chronic hemolysis\"). Many people go through life without any symptoms. It becomes a problem if the person is exposed to certain chemical compounds or toxins or experiences certain infections that can cause hemolysis and lead to severe anemia.\nPeople with G6PD deficiency have an increased risk of hemolysis and severe anemia if they have certain infections such as Fifth's disease (parvovirus), infectious hepatitis, infectious mononucleosis (mono), pneumonia, or a blood infection.\nThe body produces blood cells in the bone marrow. This is the red, soft, spongy part inside the bones. Usually a person with chronic hemolysis makes more than the average amount of red blood cells (hemoglobin) to make up for the ones being constantly destroyed. This increased rate of red blood cell production can be measured by a blood test called a reticulocyte (or \"retic\") count. The retic count is usually elevated in a person with chronic hemolysis. This means the body is keeping up with the demands for red blood cells and hemoglobin.\nIn some people with G6PD deficiency, a small amount of red blood cell destruction occurs all of the time. This form of G6PD is called \"chronic hemolysis\".\nFor persons with the form of G6PD deficiency that is associated with chronic hemolysis, their doctor may prescribe a medication called folic acid. This vitamin supplement helps the bone marrow keep up with increased production demands. The symptoms of hemolysis and the resulting anemia may include tiredness, paleness, headache, yellow tint to the whites of the eyes or skin (jaundice or icterus), fast heart beat, shortness of breath, and dark urine (tea or coke colored). Individuals with these symptoms should inform their doctor or nurse promptly.\nSpecial Considerations: What to Avoid\nYou cannot prevent G6PD deficiency, but fortunately, if you can avoid exposure to certain medicines and foods, you can prevent the more serious symptoms.\nMedications: What to Take, What to Avoid\nAny time persons with G6PD take any medication, whether prescribed by a doctor or over-the-counter, they should tell their doctor or pharmacist that they have G6PD deficiency to be sure that it is safe to take the medication.\nThe common over-the-counter treatments for fever, pain, nasal congestion and cough — acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil), pseudoephedrine (Sudafed), and guaifenesin, (Robitussin) — are usually safe at normal therapeutic doses for children with G6PD deficiency. People with G6PD deficiency should avoid medicines that contain aspirin (salicylic acid)."

        "description": "[December 14, 2016; Kennett Square, PA] – Renowned for his research on equine laminitis, Dr. Andrew van Eps joined the faculty of Penn Vet's New Bolton Center in December as Associate Professor of Equine Musculoskeletal Research. Van Eps has spent the majority of his career at The University of Queensland in Australia, most recently as Director of the Equine Hospital and Associate Professor of Equine Medicine. The University is also his alma mater; he graduated with his veterinary degree (BVSc) in 1999 and his PhD in 2008. The move marks a return to New Bolton Center, where he completed his residency in large animal internal medicine in 2008 and spent another year as a lecturer and clinician. \"We are fortunate to have attracted Dr. van Eps to Penn Vet,\" said Dr. Gary Althouse, Chairman of the Department of Clinical Studies at New Bolton Center. \"He comes to us both as a seasoned clinician and an equine researcher of international caliber.\"\nThe focus of van Eps' research is improving the understanding, prevention, and treatment of equine laminitis and other musculoskeletal diseases. Laminitis, the number-two killer of horses after colic, is a painful, debilitating condition with no known cure. \"The position at New Bolton Center is definitely a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me,\" van Eps said. \"Although I have always had a strong interest in research, it has taken a back seat to clinics, teaching, and administrative work in recent years,\" he continued. \"This position at New Bolton Center allows me to prioritize research, which for me is very exciting.\"\nNew Bolton Center was the choice for his residency because he considered it to be \"the best place in the world to train in large animal internal medicine,\" he said. \"I couldn't have hoped for a better residency program,\" van Eps said. \"I was very lucky to train under some of the most highly regarded and skilled clinicians in the world, and I am very grateful.\" A prolific researcher, van Eps has co-authored nearly 50 peer-reviewed publications along with 15 additional publications. He's given more than 60 presentations, primarily on topics related to laminitis, in places from Hong Kong to Palm Beach. He's been a co-investigator on 15 research grants. \"Andrew will bring an added dimension and depth to our existing expertise at New Bolton Center, which will perpetuate our mission of being an international leader in the field of equine musculoskeletal research and, in particular, in our goal of finding a cure for laminitis,\" Althouse said. Van Eps said he believes his work in the development and scientific validation of foot cooling (digital hypothermia/cryotherapy) as a preventative and also a treatment for acute laminitis is the most significant contribution of his work thus far. \"Laminitis used to be a common and fatal complication of systemic illness. Now, with the widespread use of digital hypothermia, this is much less common,\" he said. Van Eps' research also focuses on solving supporting-limb laminitis, the type that led to the death of 2006 Kentucky Derby winner, Barbaro, who was treated at New Bolton Center for a catastrophic leg fracture during the Preakness Stakes that year.\n\"We have made some significant inroads with regards to the cause of supporting-limb laminitis and potential preventatives,\" he said. \"I hope to continue this work and develop some practical solutions at New Bolton Center.\" About Penn Vet\nGenomic characterization of tumor heterogeneity in recurrent small cell lung cancer through research autopsy\nVirus-host interactions that regulate translation in cells infected with HSV-1\nAcute lung injury is reported to be one of the most common forms of organ dysfunction in critically injured individuals. Findings from a number of studies suggest that priming occurs at several cellular levels, in the lung and circulating neutrophils, and appears to play significant roles in mediating the increased inflammation associated with this injury. Utilizing a variety of experimental approaches (neutrophil/ macrophage depletion, adoptive transfer of neutrophils, gene specific knock-out/over-expression, in vivo antibody neutralization/ peptide antagonism/ siRNA) in a dual insult (non-pulmonary) model of hemorrhagic shock (Hem) followed by polymicrobial septic challenge (CLP), we have found evidence of `priming both in circulating neutrophils and pulmonary epithelial cells for enhanced pro-inflammatory responsiveness. However, in neutrophils, this has been associated with suppressed apoptosis, while in epithelial cells; a potentiation of apoptosis has been observed. Further, it would appear that epithelial cell `priming' after Hem for localized cytokine/ chemokine expression in the lung is antecedent/ required for macrophage activation and the eventual recruitment of `primed' neutrophils to the lungs of animals subsequently challenge by CLP. The contributions of the endothelia and other localized tissue immune cells, e.g., dendritic cells and/or lymphocytes in this activation process have not been defined. Finally, studies utilizing organ specific delivery of siRNA against extrinsic death receptor protein, Fas, indicate not only that anti-apoptotic approaches appear efficacious but that these approaches also serve to suppress aspects of the local pro-inflammatory response. However, the nature of this protection at cellular levels as well a molecular level is not clear. With this in, mind we propose the following hypothesis, which the mechanisms by which localized delivery of Fas siRNA mediates its' effects are through both inhibition of apoptosis and pro-inflammatory activation of epithelial cells `primed' by shock/Hem. To test this hypothesis, we have designed the following objectives (Aims):\nAIM 1 : We will determine the nature of Fas/FasL mediated signaling/activation of pulmonary epithelial cells, endothelial cells, neutrophils and/or alveolar macrophages to a `priming' insult such as Hem.\nAIM 4 : We will establish if endothelial cell activation and/or injury are pre- or post- to the activation/'priming'/injury of epithelial cells following shock.PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute lung injury is reported to be the most common form of organ dysfunction encountered in critically ill patients in trauma/ surgical/ medical intensive care units. This study is designed to determine what the contribution of immune (i.e., neutrophil, macrophage, dendritic cell, etc.) and non-immune cell's (i.e., epithelial and endothelial cell) natural cell suicide (apoptotic) program and/or inflammatory response are to the development of lung injury resulting from the combined insult of shock (due to blood loss) followed by septic challenge in the mouse. The contribution of these cells's apoptotic/ inflammatory processes will be examined in this setting using genetically altered mice as well as drug interventions directed at genes or mediators thought to be involved in the regulation of these processes. It is our firm belief that the results of these studies will provide information that not only should allow us to better understand the pathobiology of acute lung injury but also its attenuation. ? ?

How you react to pressure and unfavorable conditions depends mainly upon the power of your brain and your\nability to take charge of your internal activities.\nSo, can a condition that relies heavily upon one's individual mental abilities be genetic?\nActually yes, it seems the Bible was true in this regard and the sins of the father can end up plaguing\nthe children and here science does seem to give this theory the green signal.\nStudies revealed that the brain of children who had a specific genetic mutation did not produce a good amount of a chemical known as Neuropeptide Y.\nA lack of the required amount of Neuropeptide Y or NPY triggers the brain to react strongly to negative\nemotions and feelings. In a way, the impact of the negative factor is amplified and the brain's response to physiological pain is not like it should have been\nin the absence of that particular genetic mutation.\nSince stress is also a reaction of the brain towards unfavorable factors, the result of the genetic\nmutation does not leave the brain equipped enough to handle the cause from an optimistic point of view.\nApart from stress, people bearing a low level of Neuropeptide Y, were also twice more likely to go into\ndepression, the reason here is the same. Instead of looking for ways to tackle the cause, the brain's response to the factor causing depression increases the\nactivity in prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain responsible for reactions to negative emotions.\nThe prefrontal cortex is thinner and does not inhibit the negative feelings, thus regulating the brain's response in a negative light.\nAnother theory states that a person's characteristics and traits are largely acquired from their parents.\nThe genetic makeup does decide the temperament and outlook of a person, albeit not on a complete scale.\nGiven the individual characteristic and their response to adverse situations based on their genes,\nit can be said that one reason for people being stressed out can be genetic.\nSomeone who engages in self-loathing is more likely to experience anxiety and be depressed when faced with an adverse situation, as compared to someone who likes to take charge and is solution-oriented.\nHowever, such research findings still have certain grey areas and are not entirely conclusive.\nPsychologically speaking, a person's temperament does influence how they behave under pressure but more importantly the pressure induced is mostly based on external factors. There are work-related pressure, pressure brought about due to personal reasons, because of bad health, etc.\nThe level of NPY or people's frame of mind is always the response to the pressure rather than being the\ncause of stress. Like Newton's third law, the cause being the external action while the consequence of genetic mutation is the opposite and equal reaction,\nwhich eventually leads to people feeling stressed and/or depressed.\n16b678d99788da21a4a706ca3ae79f88\nThis entry was posted in Is stress Genetic and tagged is stress genetic, neuropeptide Y, prefrontal cortex, stress and anxiety on November 1, 2012 by mulkurnia.\nHave you or a loved one received a terminal or other serious diagnosis?

The device is indicated for the palliative treatment of biliary strictures resulting from malignant neoplasms.\nJanet Burpee, CEO of FSS, told Medical Device Daily that the company has no immediate plans for putting the device on the market yet. She said FSS is figuring out its launch strategy in the U.S. as well as in Europe.\n\"We're currently really focusing on development, getting product ready across the board,\" Burpee said.\nFSS says its nearly fully connected stent has coupled technology with clinical needs by providing a \"highly durable stent with superior radial stiffness and low chronic outward force.\" The key to the FSS stent technology is the integration of helically wound struts with helical flexible coils, the company said. The key to the delivery technology is simplicity, ease of use and placement, FSS noted.\n\"We are very excited about receiving 510(k) marketing clearance and were thrilled to participate in the FDA's STED review process,\" Burpee said. \"We believe our unique platform technology will continue to provide needed clinical solutions in the interventional radiology, gastroenterology, neurovascular and cardiology device marketplace.\"\nBurpee said that the FlexStent biliary self-expanding stent is \"very, very conformable,\" which she says is what sets it apart from other biliary stents on the market.\nThe company has also received CE mark authorization for the Biliary and Femoropopliteal FlexStent systems.\nEarlier this year FSS reported receiving CE-mark approval for the FlexStent biliary self-expanding stent system (Medical Device Daily, March 9, 2009).\nThe privately held company raised $6 million in a venture financing round with GBP Capital in January 2008.\nLast month FSS signed an exclusive agreement with Micrus Endovascular (San Jose, California) to jointly develop a flow diversion technology for neurovascular indications using both Micrus and FSS technology development capabilities and intellectual property. According to Micrus, flow diversion is a relatively new approach for treating large and giant aneurysms which represent roughly 20% to 25% of treated intracranial aneurysms. Unlike microcoils that are placed in the aneurysm, flow diverters are stent-like devices placed in the parent vessel. They serve to divert blood flow away from the aneurysm, thus facilitating healing, Micrus said.\nMicrus said it would be responsible for overseeing the regulatory and clinical process and will manufacture neurovascular products developed based on the agreement. Micrus said it has made an upfront payment to FSS and will make additional payments upon achieving certain development and regulatory milestones. Micrus will also pay a royalty on net sales of products incorporating the FSS platform.\nAmbetter is an insurance company that provides health insurance to over 2 million people in the United States.

Let’s get started.\nWhat is MHS Indiana (Ambetter)?\nMHS Indiana (Ambetter) insurance is coverage offered by Ambetter through the Health Insurance Marketplace in Indiana.2, first section There are 3 levels of coverage—Bronze, Silver, and Gold.2, second section\nThe bronze coverage is Ambetter Essential Care and has lower monthly premiums but higher out-of-pocket costs.2, second section The silver plan, Ambetter Balanced Care, has medium monthly premiums and medium out-of-pocket costs.2, second section Finally, the gold plan has higher monthly premiums but lower out-of-pocket costs.2, second section\nAmbetter insurance plans offer a variety of attractive benefits, including telehealth options, healthcare management programs, a 24/7 nurse advice line, and more.3, About Ambetter With 2 million members in 26 states, Ambetter has a lot of experience providing high-quality care to its members.3, experienced healthcare\nMost importantly, Ambetter plans meet the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) requirements that all long-term health plans cover 10 essential benefits, one of which is mental health and substance use treatment.4, fifth bullet That means you can rely on MHS Indiana (Ambetter) plans to help you with some or all of the cost of rehab.\nWhat Substance Addiction Does MHS Indiana (Ambetter) Cover?\nPeople struggle with a wide variety of substances. Common addictions include prescription drugs, opioids, meth, marijuana, alcohol, cocaine, and heroin.5, bulleted list\nIf you struggle with any of these substances, there are treatment programs that can help. Many treatment programs can address a wide variety of different substances, while others may specialize in treating misuse of one specific substance.\nBecause misusing drugs can cause a wide range of legal and health issues, getting the help you need as soon as possible is important. That’s why we’re available 24/7 to verify your insurance and answer any questions you have about rehab.\nWhat does MHS Indiana (Ambetter) Insurance cover in addiction treatment?\nThere is a wide variety of treatment programs that use high-quality evidence-based approaches. Finding the treatment that’s right for you will require you to work closely with your doctor. Your doctor will ask questions about what substances you use, for how long, and how often. There will also be questions about your habits, triggers, social circle, and home environment.\nUsing that information, your doctor will put together a treatment plan to set you on the path to a substance-free life. Some of the most common treatment options include:6,7\nInpatient Rehab. Inpatient rehab invites you to live at a treatment facility full-time for the duration of the program, which may be several weeks or months. During this time you’ll break out of old habits and learn new ways to approach your emotions and choices.\nOutpatient Rehab. When you participate in outpatient rehab, you live at home and attend a few hours of treatment per week. This can be an excellent way to transition from an inpatient program into daily life, and allows you to work or attend school during treatment.\nIntensive Outpatient Programs (IOP). An intensive outpatient program gives you outpatient care (you live at home) that’s more focused and intensive than usual outpatient treatment. You’ll attend treatment several days a week for a few hours at a time. This allows you more time to work on new habits and mindsets.\nPartial Hospitalization Programs (PHP). PHPs provide full-time treatment but you still spend evenings at home. This can give you a focused full-time therapy schedule while still allowing you to save money over traditional inpatient programs.\nOf course, the best rehab program is a finished one. Attending your program all the way through graduation is the best way to set yourself up for success, so be sure to commit to your program so you can truly break free from substance use.\nDoes MHS Indiana (Ambetter) Cover Mental Health & Co-Occurring Disorder Treatment?\nIt’s quite common for those who struggle with substance use to also have mental health concerns. In fact, 50% of those who misuse substances also have a mental health diagnosis, which is known as having a co-occurring disorder.8, second paragraph\nIf you struggle with mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or any other diagnosis, it’s important to treat your mental health and substance use simultaneously. Studies show that those who get integrated treatment have far better results than people who treat only one or the other.9, first paragraph Finding a treatment program that addresses co-occurring disorders is essential if you struggle with your mental health.\nThe ACA includes both mental health treatment and substance use treatment in the list of essential health benefits, so you can rest easy knowing your MHS Indiana (Ambetter) insurance plans benefits will help you pay for both.4, fifth bullet\nHow Long Does MHS Indiana (Ambetter) Cover Inpatient Alcohol and Drug Rehab programs?\nOne common question we hear is, “How long will rehab be?” The answer to that question depends on your specific needs, which will be reflected in the treatment plan your doctor creates for you.\nEvery insurance plan is different, so you’ll want to review your MHS Indiana (Ambetter) insurance coverage for treatment before you commit to a program. However, research shows that most people need at least 90 days to make a significant change in their substance use habits.10, fifth bullet\nTo learn more about your insurance plan’s coverage, you can call the phone number on the back of your insurance card or you can contact American Addiction Centers (AAC) by phone or online. We can review your coverage and verify your insurance in just a few minutes, and we’re available for you 24/7.\nWhat if my MHS Indiana (Ambetter) policy does not cover an Inpatient drug rehab program?\nOnce you learn more about your MHS Indiana (Ambetter) rehab coverage, you might discover that it only covers part of the cost of rehab or that the inpatient treatment center you’re interested in isn’t covered by your insurance.\nDon’t let that stop you from getting the help you need. Instead, take a look at different ways to pay for rehab. For example, you might be able to get a loan or borrow money from family and friends. Or, you can find a treatment center that offers scholarships.\nSome rehabs also offer payment plans or have a sliding scale of fees based on your income. The key is to get the treatment you need as soon as possible. Substance use has long-term legal and health consequences that you want to avoid, so get the help you need today.\nMHS Indiana (Ambetter) In Network vs. Out of Network Inpatient Drug Rehab Centers\nWhy would one rehab center be covered by your MHS Indiana (Ambetter) mental health coverage while another is not?\nThe answer is that all insurance plans have a specific provider network. These provider networks are doctors and specialists that agree to treat plan members for a lower cost.11, p. 1 What’s a Provider Network When you use in-network providers, you pay less out of pocket.11, p. 2, Why do some plans…\nHowever, if you use providers that aren’t part of the insurance plan’s network, you’ll pay far more out-of-pocket.11, p. 2, Why do some plans… In fact, some insurance plans don’t pay anything for out-of-network treatment, which means that you pay the full cost yourself.11, p. 2, Why do some plans…\nFortunately, there are a lot of MHS Indiana (Ambetter) rehab facilities to choose from. Focusing on these allows you to maximize your insurance coverage and keep your personal costs low.\nIf you decide you want to attend an out-of-network treatment center, you may have to get creative with how you pay for rehab, such as looking for a payment plan or loans.\nWhat Rehab Centers Take Ambetter Insurance?\nAmerican Addiction Centers (AAC) has various rehab facilities around the country that provide drug and alcohol addiction treatment.

The annual JCR release helps the research community to evaluate the world’s high-quality academic journals using a range of indicators, descriptive data and visualisations. The reports are used by academic publishers across the globe to understand the scholarly impact of their journals relative to their field and promote them to the research community. \nThe JCR is based on 2021 data compiled from the Web of Science Core Collection, a collection of journals, books and conference proceedings in the world's largest publisher-neutral global citation database. Publications are evaluated by  a global team of  in-house editors at Clarivate. The data  from selected content are  then curated to ensure  accuracy in the JCR metrics, together with a wide body of descriptive data. These insights enable researchers, publishers, editors, librarians and funders to explore the key drivers of a journal's value for diverse audiences.\nThe report shows that Covid-19 continues to influence every aspect of scholarly publishing, just as it has affected every aspect of society .\nNandita Quaderi, editor-in-chief and vice president editorial, Web of Science at Clarivate, said: 'Through the carefully selected and curated data within the Journal Citation Reports, we can fully appreciate and understand the enormous impact of the academic community’s rapid response to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n'As researchers explored the origins, spread and ramifications of the virus, working at speed to create new therapies and vaccines, we see this reflected in the trusted insights contained in the annual JCR. The effects of this pandemic will continue to be seen in the literature and citation impact for decades, particularly under the lens of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal 3 on Health and Wellbeing. We are proud to support the research community and the UN SDGs with expertly curated data that informs decisions and helps them accelerate the pace of innovation.'\nThis year’s release sees continued notable increases in citation impact for journals in the fields of general medicine, critical care, public health, infectious diseases, immunology and basic biomedical sciences:\nThis year The Lancet's Journal Impact Factor (JIF) of 202.731 has moved it to the #1 position in the general & internal medicine category, overtaking the New England Journal of Medicine, which has been the top-ranked title in that category since the first release of the JCR 45 years ago. Of the 10 articles with the highest citation count in 2021, three appeared in The Lancet. All three are directly related to the characterisation and treatment of Covid-19;\nThis year Nature earns the distinction of being the first ever journal to accumulate more than one million total citations in one year. Nature published 16 items with more than 500 JIF citations – of which 12 items were Covid-19 related; and\nSeven journals had JIFs of more than 100 for the first time, all of which published high quantities of Covid-19 related research. These are the Journal of the American Medical Association, The Lancet, Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, Nature Reviews Immunology, Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology and the New England Journal of Medicine.\nUpholding research integrity and a new type of citation distortion\nTo support objectivity in journal selection and the integrity of the reports, Clarivate has suppressed three journals from the JCR (without presumption or accusation of wrong doing), representing 0.01% of the journals listed. Clarivate monitors and excludes journals that demonstrate anomalous citation behavior including where there is evidence of excessive journal self-citation and/or citation stacking. The methodology and parameters for the effect of journal self-citation on JCR metrics were updated in 2020 to better account for discipline norms. The suppression of a journal from the JCR does not equate to a de-listing from the Web of Science Core Collection.  \nIn addition, this year the editorial integrity team at Clarivate identified a new type of anomalous citation behaviour: self stacking. This is where the journal contains one or more documents with citations that are highly concentrated to the JIF numerator of the title itself.  This is the first year the company have formally defined the criteria for self-stacking suppression, and as such made the decision to issue a warning to six journals rather than suppress the journal’s JIF. Going forward, continued journal self-stacking will result in suppression of JIF, Clarivate says.  \nThe Journal Citation Reports contains more than 21,000 journals, from 254 research categories and 114 countries. This includes:\n12,800 science journals;\n6,600 social science journals;\n3,000 arts and humanities journals;\nAlmost 13,000 journals have at least one gold open access publication;\nMore than 5,300 journals publish all of their content via open access; and\n192 journals received a Journal Impact Factor for the first time.\nEach journal profile in the JCR provides a rich array of journal intelligence metrics and allows users to filter by category and rank. These include:  \nThe Journal Citation Indicator, which represents the average category-normalised citation impact for papers published in the prior three-year period. All journals in the JCR are eligible to receive this metric as of 2021;  \nThe Immediacy Index, which measures how frequently the journal’s content is cited within the same year as publication;  \nThe journal’s rank in category, determined by Journal Impact Factor, expressed as a percentile;  \nCited half-life, which is the median age, in years, of items in the journal that were cited during the JCR year; and \nThe Journal Impact Factor, which is given to journals in SCIE and SSCI, and which scales the citations received to recent content by a measure of the size of the journal’s scholarly output.\nIn addition the Journal Citation Reports include descriptive data such as open access content, top contributing institutions and regions.\nVisit the  Journal Citation Reports  website  to explore all available data, metrics and analysis. You can find more information including the Clarivate suppression policy in the Journal Citation Reports Reference Guide.\nBACKGROUND READING: Nandita Quaderi,editor-in-chief and vice president of Web of Science Editorial, explains how Covid-19 continues to affect the citation network, and introduces a new kind of citation distortion\nJournal Citation Reports website\nLibrary news\nPublishing news\nIndustry trends\nClarivate\nWeb of Science\nJournals\nCitation\nCovid-19\nLatest issue\nResearch Information Autumn 2022\nThe critical range of publishing platforms\nPublishing platforms are digital solutions that are principally designed to help publishers and authors to evaluate and disseminate content\nThe possibilities of open science\nResearch Information spoke to four experts in the field about the ongoing move to open science, and the challenges that have emerged in an increasingly complex open-science ecosystem\nBridging the gap with video\nSiân Harris considers the use of video in scholarly communications today and the challenges and opportunities for the future\nSupport for early-career researchers\nSix university presses join forces to support early-career researchers from 2022 to 2025 with the OpenUP initiative\n‘We’re prioritising the in-person event to the highest degree’\nLeah Hinds, executive director, Charleston Hub, gives us the details of the new and improved conference taking place in November, including session and speaker information, as well as insights into what’s new this year\nPhoto credit: Olwenn Ní Dhubhghaill\nDebunking digital myths\nSabine Louët uncovers three myths about digital research dissemination and shares lessons she has learned\nFive industry leaders on the future of publishing platforms\nAs the move towards open science and FAIR data progresses, platform providers are facing new challenges.

The surface hardness is 40~80% higher than that of hardened bearings steel. The friction coefficient is similar to PTFE or MoS2. Has self-lubricating properties. , It has good bonding with the substrate and does not peel off. The life and wear resistance of SKF bearings are greatly improved, and they can still work normally under the condition of cutting oil. They are called \"wear-free bearings\";\nThe second is to use PSC to spray a layer of aluminum oxide with a thickness of 100μm on the outer circumference of the SKF bearing outer ring, so that the insulation capacity of the bearing can reach more than 1000V, and the bearing has a higher insulation capacity by increasing the thickness of the aluminum oxide . The coated alumina is firmly bonded to the substrate and can also improve the corrosion resistance of SKF bearings. Electroplated bearings can be installed like ordinary bearings.\nLow temperature ion vulcanization is a surface modification technology that emerged in the late 1980s.\nThe basic principle is similar to ion nitriding. Under a certain degree of vacuum, high-voltage direct current ionizes sulfur-containing gas. The generated sulfide ions bombard the surface of the workpiece and react with the iron on the surface of the workpiece to form a sulfide with a thickness of about 10 μm, which is mainly composed of FeS. Physical layer. Sulfide is a good solid lubricant that can effectively reduce the friction coefficient of the steel contact surface, and with the increase of the load, the friction coefficient is further reduced, so it can greatly improve the wear resistance of the bearing under heavy load and prolong its use The number of bearing seats of SKF bearings can be increased by about 3 times.\nThe quality of heat treatment is directly related to the quality of subsequent treatment, which will ultimately affect the performance and life of the parts. At the same time, heat treatment is also a major energy consumer and major polluter in the machinery industry.\nIn recent years, with the progress of science and technology and its application in heat treatment, the development of heat treatment technology is mainly reflected in the following aspects:\nWastewater, waste gas, waste salt, dust, noise and electromagnetic radiation produced by heat treatment will pollute the environment. In order to solve the environmental pollution problem of heat treatment, the implementation of clean heat treatment (or green environment heat treatment) is one of the development directions of heat treatment technology in developed countries. In order to reduce the emissions of SO 2, CO, CO 2, dust and coal slag, the use of coal as fuel has been basically eliminated, and the use of heavy oil has become less and less. Most light oil is used. Natural gas is still the most ideal fuel. The waste heat utilization rate of the burner has reached a very high level. The optimization of the burner structure and the strict control of the air-fuel ratio ensure that NOx and CO are minimized under the premise of reasonable combustion. Gas carburizing and carbonitriding technology is adopted, and vacuum heat treatment technology is used to replace salt bath treatment to reduce the pollution of wastewater and CN toxic substances to water sources; water-soluble synthetic quenching oil is used to replace part of quenching oil, and biodegradable vegetable oil is used to replace part of it Mineral oil to reduce oil pollution.\nPrecision heat treatment has two meanings: On the one hand, it uses physical metallurgical knowledge and advanced computer simulation and testing technology to optimize process parameters according to the requirements of parts, materials and structure dimensions to achieve the required performance or maximize the use of materials. On the one hand, it is sufficient to ensure the stability of the optimization process, achieve small (or zero) product quality dispersion and zero heat treatment distortion.\nScientific production and energy management are the most potential factors for the effective use of energy. It is the choice of scientific management to establish a professional heat treatment plant to ensure full production and give full play to the equipment capabilities. In terms of heat treatment energy structure, primary energy is preferable. Make full use of waste heat and waste heat; low energy consumption, short cycle technology is used to replace long cycle, high energy consumption technology.\n4. Less non-oxidizing heat treatment\nFrom heating with a protective atmosphere instead of heating with an oxidizing atmosphere to heating with a controlled atmosphere that precisely controls the carbon and nitrogen potentials, the performance of the parts after heat treatment is improved, the heat treatment defects such as decarburization and cracking are greatly reduced, and the heat treatment The amount of finish processing improves the material utilization rate and processing efficiency. Vacuum heating gas quenching, vacuum or low-pressure carburizing, nitriding, nitrocarburizing and boronizing can significantly improve quality, reduce deformation and extend service life.\nThe heat treatment quality control of bearing parts is the most stringent in the entire machinery industry. SKF bearing heat treatment has made considerable progress in the past 20 years, mainly in the following aspects: basic theoretical research on heat treatment; research on heat treatment technology and application technology; development of new heat treatment equipment and related technologies.\nLogic Behind Why Marijuana is known as a different Amount of Remedies8555 – Viet My Visa\nLogic Behind Why Marijuana is known as a different Amount of Remedies8555\nThe medical experts make it obvious that cannabis can be used probably the most and trusted method of dealing with HIV, Tools, Glaucoma and Parkinson's disease people. Person who is suffering from several life threatening illnesses have the only expect of receiving speedy and profitable remedy as opposed to the classic and regular method of getting therapy. The medical expert and scientific study has placed lot of stress around the status authorities to legalize medical weed. Immediately after studying all of the point federal government has legalized this cannabis for the treatment inside the status using the state that she or he must have the health care weed permit for the utilization of this botanical herb. At first of legalization, there were clearly a lot of controversies about the health-related cannabis but the truth is that it must be just one greatest method of managing clients. Consequently, if you are searching for the health cannabis dispensary then you definately must buy a cannabis therapy unit card granted on your part community well being office. Here are a few crucial ideas and information with regards to the cannabis treatment method that will help in receiving medical care greeting card.\nFor anybody who end up enthusiastic about the healthcare industry but do not have the confident.\nThe medical experts are making it crystal clear that weed can be used as just about the most.\nPrior to signing up for any system or study course for a health helper, allow.\nCommonly, this has been recognized there are many individuals who don't stick to the.\nFor everyone who end up thinking about the health care field but do not have the comfortable as a doctor or even a doctor, but are eager to support other individuals and do not get the anxiety for the view of blood flow, then a health asst . might be the vocation which is well suited for you.\nHealth care field but do not\nPrior to signing up for your plan or study course to get a medical assistant, let us visit a few of the essential advantages as being a medical associate.\nThe main and most crucial thing in obtaining medical therapy cards is to locate a genuine healthcare professional in your state having the permit of delivering MMJ Unit card. As soon as you use the appointment using these medical professionals, they can do an examination to actually really need treatment. After getting the health care exam report and dependant on the fitness of individual they can examine that medical attention is necessary or otherwise. When the skilled is happy about the fitness of affected individual and health record they will provide you suggestion for your medical therapy inside your particular express. After having the advice for medical therapy then you must view your health and wellbeing division where one can make application for medical marijuana permit on the health care form in addition to the fretting hand created prescribed. Following verifying every one of your documents they may problem the unit card which you can use for your healthcare cannabis treatment method as part of your particular condition.\nThe fitness of affected individual\nNormally, it has been observed that there are many people who don't keep to the regulations and rules produced by government entities and puts on their own in danger. To acheive this procedure cards they speak to the card service provider corporations thru phone and will get capture easily on the companies who give fake unit card. Thus, it usually is easier to ask about the recommendation and recognition about the unit card provider organizations from your location applying for the advice. If anyone fails by doing this sometimes by deliberately or for some other good reasons they might be penalized or sometime receives jailed. While, strategy for getting healthcare weed permit is agony staking procedure but to be able to avoid the future difficulties you need to stick to the technique of finding this treatment unit card. This would definitely help out with the utilization of marijuana together with getting a powerful health cannabis treatment method.\nCompare DNA Testing Kits | Find the right DNA testing kit for you.\nWhat DNA test are you looking for?\nSome people want to connect and discover relatives, or past relatives connected to them.

According to a major study on depression in 2013, it is estimated that 1 in 10 people over the age of 18 have a form of depression, totaling over 15 million people in the U.S. It is estimated that 17% of the population will experience a major depressive episode during the course of their life. Put in perspective, that is close to 1 and 5 people will experience a depressive episode during their life.\nThere are three common types of depression including major depression, persistent depressive disorder (PDD), and bipolar disorder. The effects of depression vary person-to-person and disorder-to-disorder. It is important to understand the difference between the different types of depression in order to appropriately treat the particular disorder.\nMajor depressive is classified as being sad and unhappy for two weeks or longer and feelings of hopeless, helpless, and worthless. In addition to an extended period of sadness, a two-week people experiencing depression also have a hard time finding enjoyment in things that once brought them joy and happiness in everyday life. Differentiating between short-lived moments of sadness and depression can be challenging since everyone experiences hard times throughout their lives. Speaking with a medical professional can be helpful for many people to determine whether they are depressed or they are going through a temporary hard time.\nPersistent Depressive Disorder (PDD) is a form of depression that last for at least 2 years. In children and adolescents, one year or longer of depressive symptoms can be diagnosed as Persistent Depressive Disorder. PDD is usually not as severe than major depression, but the symptoms are very similar to major depression.\nBipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is a form of depression and it is classified as experiencing severe mood swings. A person who is diagnosed with bipolar disorder usually is extremely happy one day and then shows symptoms of depression such as severe sadness the next day. People with Bipolar disorder usually have many more lows than highs. While research continues on bipolar disorder, there continues to be no one factor that leads to the mental illness.\nWhile there are many resemblances among people affected by depression, there are some notable differences between men and women when it comes to depression. Female specific depression conditions include premenstrual problems, pregnancy and infertility, postpartum depression, and menopause.\nTo complicate diagnoses, women often experience what is called atypical depression. This means that instead of eating less, women eat more, and instead sleeping less, women sleep more.\nMen are usually less willing to seek help for depression or admitting to being depressed. If a man seeks help for depression, it can be seen as a weakness leading them to seek help less than women. When evaluating symptoms of depression in men, it is important to know that not all signs and symptoms are the same as common depression symptoms. For instance, instead of feeling sad for an extended period of time, men often get angry and irritable for an extended duration. Instead of using friends and food for support, men often turn to alcohol, TV, and sports to self medicate.\nWhen adults move into their golden years, there are many changes older adults and seniors experience in which they are not prepared for. Through these changes, it’s not uncommon for a senior to experience a major depressive episode. Common changes among older adults that can lead to depression include medical problems, retirement, loss of loved ones and friends, and isolation. Some of the standard signs and symptoms of depression in seniors include; social withdrawal, sadness, fatigue, weight loss or loss of appetite, loss of self worth, sleep issues, and suicidal thoughts or attempts. Often time’s, seniors are more likely to get angry versus sad as they go through depression.\nDuring the teenage years, there are a dozens, if not hundreds of changes that teens must cope with and adapt to. These changes can include; puberty, social pressures, and trying to find out who they are and where they fit into society. When looking at signs of depression in teens and adolescents, it’s important to understand they also have a unique set of signs and symptoms compared to adults.\nWhile sadness is common among many adults who are depressed, teens are more likely to show anger, aggression, and hostility. Teens who are depressed sometimes deal with these pressures by using alcohol and drugs, running away, participating in reckless behavior, and sometimes can resort to violence.\nThe causes of depression are not fully understood yet in the medical field, but it’s generally a combination of environmental, biological, genetic, and psychological factors. While there may one event that triggers a depressive episode, there are usually a number of underlying factors that need to be addressed as well.\nMajor depressive episodes can be caused by situational events such as a loss of a loved one or friend, relationship problems, divorce, loss of a job, financial trouble, personal accident or trauma, social pressures, and other instances that can affect a person’s overall well being.\nWhile depressive condition is usually genetic, it can also happen to those who have no family history of depression.\nAfter being diagnosed with depression, a combination of psychological sessions / treatments and medication is common when treating people for depression. Unlike illnesses that can be treated with prescribed medication or surgery, changes in choices that led to the depressive episode and therapy are both instrumental in treatment and recovery.\nAt Peak Behavioral Health Services in El Paso, TX, patients go through a free evaluation and if a form of depression is diagnosed, we then work with the patient and involved parties to come up with a personalized treatment plan for recovery.\nCombined with the PSL PSL 611-15-1 bearing in Tokelau Is. , PSL PSL 611-15-1 bearing in Tokelau Is. has the most complete product outline in rolling bearing industry .PSL PSL 611-15-1 bearing in Tokelau Is. provide customers with a series of comprehensive and perfect service and technical support.

Call our office or request an appointment online today.\nThese symptoms are related to chemical changes within your body driven by the unrelenting fear you’re experiencing. They are part of your brain’s natural fight-or-flight response to danger.\nWhat are the different types of anxiety disorders?\nThere are several types of anxiety disorder that can affect women, the most common of which include:\nObsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)\nObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) features a pattern of unwanted thoughts and fears (obsessions) that lead you to do repetitive behaviors (compulsions). These obsessions and compulsions interfere with daily activities and cause significant distress.\nGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD)\nGAD causes a sometimes seemingly constant flow of worry over various issues such as work or home life, relationships, or your health. Individuals with GAD often note their thoughts simply move from one worrisome topic to another throughout their day.\nPanic disorder\nPanic disorder is characterized by sudden and very intense feelings of panic that may be best described as terror. These attacks can occur without warning for no apparent reason or when you’re facing a situation you dread, such as a public speaking obligation or project presentation at work.\nPanic attacks cause symptoms that can mimic a heart attack and often make you feel as if you’re dying.\nPhobias\nPhobias are intense fears of certain social situations, objects, or animals that you may try to avoid. Individuals with agoraphobia may eventually isolate themselves at home rather than risk a public panic attack.\nHealth Anxiety\nHealth anxiety is very common. Individuals with health anxiety have a preoccupation with the belief that they have or will soon develop a serious illness. Those with health anxiety will often misinterpret normal bodily sensations, such as a headache, to mean that there is something seriously wrong. Similarly, they may hear about someone falling ill and then begin to scan their bodies for signs of similar illness, which often results in their finding some evidence to make them believe they will be getting sick soon.\nHow do you treat anxiety disorders?\nTreatment plans offered at WCWCW are tailored to each patient and their unique situation. Plans include a full diagnostic evaluation followed by evidence-based therapies that offer relief from the devastating effects of anxiety.\nOur specialists at WCWCW in Bethesda, Maryland, offer the supportive care you need to overcome the challenges of bipolar disorder.

If you eat a lot of sweet foods, or a lot of fatty foods, both can cause elevated sugar levels, according to the NIH.

Severe allergic reactions always require emergency medical care.\nTreating allergic reactions\nMany mild to moderate allergic reactions can be treated at home or with OTC medications. The following treatments are commonly used to reduce the symptoms of an allergic reaction:\nAntihistamines\nAntihistamines can help to treat most minor allergic reactions regardless of the cause. These drugs reduce the body’s production of histamine, which reduces all symptoms, including sneezing, watering eyes, and skin reactions.\nSecond-generation antihistamines, including Claritin (loratadine) and Zyrtec (cetirizine), are less likely to cause drowsiness than first-generation antihistamines, such as Benadryl.\nAntihistamines come in several forms, usually to help deliver the medication closer to the source of the reaction or make it easier to consume, such as:\noral pills\ndissolvable tablets\nnasal sprays\nliquids\neye drops\nAntihistamines in these forms are available from pharmacies, to buy online, or on prescription from a doctor.\nAntihistamines can also be taken to prevent allergies. Many people with seasonal or pet allergies will begin taking antihistamines when they know they are going to be exposed to an allergen.\nA person who is pregnant or has a liver disorder should consult their doctor before taking antihistamines.\nNasal decongestants\nNasal decongestant pills, liquids, and sprays can also help reduce stuffy, swollen sinuses and related symptoms, such as a sore throat or coughing.\nHowever, decongestant medications should not be taken continuously for more than 72 hours.\nNasal decongestants are available over the counter and online.\nAnti-inflammatory medication\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs) may also be used to help temporarily reduce pain, swelling, and cramping caused by allergies.\nAvoid the allergen\nThe best way to treat and prevent allergic reactions is to know what triggers the reaction and stay away from it, especially food allergens.\nWhen this is not possible or realistic, using antihistamines or decongestants when in contact with allergens can help to treat the symptoms.\nUse a saline sinus rinse :\nA saline sinus rinse may treat symptoms such as a runny or itchy nose.\nWhen allergies cause sinus problems, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) recommend a person rinse their sinuses with saline. This can remove allergens and clear the airways.\nThe AAAAI recommend the following saline recipe:\nmix 3 teaspoons of salt (without iodide) with 1 teaspoon of baking soda\nadd 1 teaspoon of this mixture to 8 ounces of boiled water\ndissolve the mixture in the water then use as a saline rinse\nSinus rinsing devices can be purchased online or from a pharmacy.\nTreating environmental allergies\nFor airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust, and mold spores, additional treatment options include:\nthroat lozenges with soothing ingredients, such as menthol, honey, or ginger\nshower and wash all clothing after being exposed to an allergen\nexercise for a few minutes to help reduce nasal congestion\nTreating allergies on the skin: For allergic reactions that cause skin symptoms, including those associated with allergens found in animal saliva, poisonous plants, drugs, chemicals and metals, additional treatment options include:\nTopical corticosteroid creams or tablets. Corticosteroids contain steroids that reduce inflammation and itching. Mild forms of these creams can be found online, and a doctor can prescribe stronger versions.\nMoisturizing creams. Emollient creams with soothing ingredients, such as calamine can treat skin reactions.\nBite or sting medication. Medication targeted to reduce allergic reactions to insect bites or stings have a similar effect to other allergy medications.\nIce pack. Applying an ice pack wrapped in cloth to the area for 10- to 15-minute intervals can reduce inflammation.\nTreating severe allergies: People should speak to a professional if they have or suspect that they have severe or chronic allergies.\nA doctor or allergy specialist can prescribe medications that contain much stronger doses of the compounds found in OTC products.\nTreatment options for chronic or severe allergies include:\nImmunotherapy, or allergy shots. Immunotherapy can be between 90 and 98 percent effective at reducing allergic reactions to insect stings, for instance.\nPrescription asthma medications, such as bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids.\nOral cromolyn can be taken for food allergies.\nDrug desensitization therapy is used for specific allergens.\nEverything you need to know about allergies\nAllergies happen when a person’s body reacts too strongly to an otherwise harmless substance. Learn more about the symptoms, causes, diagnosis, and treatment for allergies here.\nNatural remedies for allergic reactions\nMany traditional medicine systems use herbal supplements and extracts to both treat and prevent allergic reactions, especially seasonal allergies.\nThough there is little scientific evidence to support the use of most alternative or natural remedies, some people may find that some can provide relief from their symptoms.\nThe American Association of Naturopathic Physicians recommend the following natural treatments for allergies:\nDietary changes. A low-fat diet high in complex carbohydrates, such as beans, whole grains, and vegetables may reduce allergy reactions.\nBioflavonoids. These plant-based chemicals found in citrus fruits and blackcurrants may act as natural antihistamines. These can also be taken as supplements.\nSupplements. Flaxseed oil, zinc, and vitamins A, C, and E are suggested to improve allergy symptoms.\nAcupuncture. Acupuncture treatments may help some people to find relief from their symptoms.\nIdentifying and treating anaphylaxis\nAn EpiPen is designed to treat anaphylaxis, and should be used at the first sign of a severe allergc reaction.\nA very severe allergic reaction can lead to a condition called anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock.\nAnaphylaxis occurs when the body’s immune response to an allergen is so severe and sudden that the body goes into a state of shock.\nAnaphylaxis can impact multiple organs and if left untreated lead to coma, organ failure, and death.\nThe early symptoms of anaphylaxis can be fairly mild and similar to those of minor to moderate allergic reactions, but they often rapidly worsen.\nSymptoms unique to anaphylaxis include:\nunexplained anxiety\ntingling in the palms of the hand, soles of the feet, and lips\nswollen tongue, throat, mouth, and face\ndifficulty breathing\nrapid but weak pulse\nlow blood pressure\nsense of dread or doom\nvomiting or diarrhea\nconfusion or disorientation\nloss of consciousness\nvery pale or blue skin\na heart attack\nIf the person carries an EpiPen, which is a self-injectable dose of epinephrine that is designed to treat anaphylaxis, inject this into their thigh, as soon as possible.\nFirst aid for anaphylaxis includes:\ntry to keep the person calm\nthe person may vomit, so turn them on their side and keep their mouth clear\ntry to get the person to lay flat on their back with their feet raised about a foot above the ground\nmake sure the person’s clothing is loose or remove constricting clothing\ndo not give them anything to drink or eat, even if they ask for it\nif they are not breathing, practice CPR with around 100 firm chest compressions every minute until emergency services arrive\nIf a person does not have an EpiPen, a doctor or paramedic will give an injection of the hormone epinephrine, or adrenaline. This will immediately increase the output of the heart and blood flow throughout the body.\nA person should seek medical care each time anaphylaxis occurs. Even if they start to feel better or their symptoms go away, a second severe allergic reaction can occur up to 12 hours after the initial response.\nAllergy symptoms\nThe symptoms associated with an allergic response depend on the specific allergen, how severe the allergy is, and whether a person has touched, swallowed, or inhaled the allergen.\nNot everyone responds the same way to each allergen. But there are similar sets of symptoms most people experience when exposed to specific allergens.\nAllergic Reactions to skin Allergy Reactions allergy symptoms dust allergy Insect Allergies Skin Allergy\nFacebookTwitterLinkedIn\nsigns and symptoms of anaphylaxis : Know more about it\nPrevious\nThe Modern Rules Of Symptoms Of Anaphylactic Reactions\nNext\nsoftarch\nRecommended Posts\nThe Modern Rules Of Symptoms Of Anaphylactic Reactions\nsigns and symptoms of anaphylaxis : Know more about it\nTackle your dust allergy reactions effectively\nRecent Posts\nThe Modern Rules Of Symptoms Of Anaphylactic Reactions\nTop 3 Natural Remedies For Allergic Reactions\nsigns and symptoms of anaphylaxis : Know more about it\n8 Most common causes of food allergic reactions\nTackle your dust allergy reactions effectively\nCategories\nAllergy\nDust Allergy\nFood allergies\nInsect Allergy\nSkin Allergy\nArchives\nJune 2020\nApril 2020\nFebruary 2020\nJanuary 2020\nAbout Allergyapp\nAlleapp `the first and only allergy app’ for allergic patients and emergency SOS function for severe allergic emergency.

The PHS Act was amended by the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA) of 2006External and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Reauthorization Act (PAHPRA) of 2013External.\nUnder the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance ActExternal, the President may declare an emergency at the request of the Governor of an affected State, or a Chief Executive of an affected Indian Tribe. The president can also declare an emergency without a Gubernatorial request if the primary responsibility for response rests with the Federal Government in order to provide expedited Federal assistance and support necessary.\nThe HHS Secretary may, under section 319 of the PHS ActExternal determine that a disease or disorder presents a public health emergency; or that a public health emergency, including significant outbreaks of infectious disease or bioterrorist attacks, otherwise exists. Following a section 319 declaration, the Secretary can take many actions during an influenza pandemic, including making grants; entering into contracts; and conducting and supporting investigations into the cause, treatment, or prevention of the disease or disorder, and waiving or modifying certain Medicare, Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) and Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act (HIPAA) requirements. These waivers or modifications are permitted under Section 1135 of the Social Security ActExternal to ensure sufficient health care items and services are available during a public health emergency.\nUnder the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act)External of the PHS Act, the HHS Secretary is also authorized to issue a PREP Act declaration that provides immunity from liability (except for willful misconduct) for claims of loss caused, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from administration or use of countermeasures to diseases, threats and conditions determined by the Secretary to constitute a present, or credible risk of a future public health emergency to entities and individuals involved in the development, manufacture, testing, distribution, administration, and use of such countermeasures. A PREP Act declaration is different from and not dependent on other emergency declarations.\nVisit the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) website for a comprehensive overview of the HHS legal authorities, policies and committeesExternal for responding to public health emergencies. Read the \"Public Health Emergency Declarations Q&AExternal\" and the \"PREP Act Frequently Asked Questions\"External for more information about the legal authorities of the HHS Secretary.\nThe Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act is the foundation for Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) authority and responsibility to protect and promote the public health by, among other things, ensuring the safety and effectiveness of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices; and ensuring the safety and security of our nation's food supply. Section 564 of the FD&C Act, authorizes the HHS Secretary to declare an emergency justifying the emergency use authorization (EUA)External of medical countermeasures (MCMs) during public health emergencies. When an EUA is declared, the FDA Commissioner can allow either (a) the use of an unapproved medical product (e.g., drug, vaccine, or diagnostic device) or (b) the unapproved use of an approved medical product during an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent a serious or life-threatening disease or condition caused by a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) agent. For example, during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, the FDA approved the emergency use of antivirals for certain patients and health care settingsExternal.\nAn EUA declaration can be made only when certain legal criteria are met and when scientific evidence is available to support the use during an emergency. For more information, please visit the following Food and Drug Administration web pages.\nFDA Medical Countermeasure (MCM) Legal, Regulatory and Policy FrameworkExternal\nFDA Emergency Use AuthoritiesExternal\nFDA PAPHRA Q&A for Public Health Preparedness and Response StakeholdersExternal\nFDA Emergency Use Authority of Medical Products and Related Authorities (April 2016)External\nFDA Emergency use of an Investigational Drug or BiologicExternal\nUnder section 361 of the PHS Act, the HHS Secretary is authorized to take measures to prevent the entry and spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the US and between states. The authority for carrying out these functions on a daily basis is delegated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. More information about legal authorities for isolation and quarantine is available on the CDC Quarantine and Isolation web page.Related Links\nCurriculum – UW Department of Psychiatry – UW–Madison\nUW Addiction Psychiatry Fellowship\nThe curriculum is designed to offer fellows a wide breath and depth of exposure to treating patients as an addiction psychiatrist.\nThe primary training sites include:\nWilliam S.

Imagine the buzz.\n​Pain, swelling, redness, immobility and heat -- these are all common signs of inflammation with injuries or an infection. Chronic inflammation also occurs inside our body and can present itself in other ways. When inflammation triggers sensory nerve endings, it can result in symptoms such as fatigue, rashes, and chest, abdominal and joint pain.\nWhat is Inflammation?\nInflammation is a natural function with a bad reputation. It’s a word most of us associate with pain, discomfort and poor health -- yet its ultimate purpose is actually to help us. Without inflammation, injuries could fester and infections could become deadly.\nWhen the body is injured, inflammation is a signal to the immune system to send white blood cells so the healing process may begin. Unfortunately, when inflammation continues on for too long, it can potentially trigger numerous other chronic health issues in the body including cancers, depression, food sensitivities and asthma. In fact, some say inflammation is the “new cholesterol” due to its direct link to heart disease.\nIn some cases, inflammation occurs when the immune systems revolts against us and attacks our own bodies. Autoimmune diseases include rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, IBD, among dozens of others. There are over 80 different autoimmune diseases.\nTop Tips to Reduce Inflammation\nFirst, let’s take a quick look at inflammatory foods that you definitely don’t want to put into your body. You probably already know all the usual suspects by name – sugar and artificial sweeteners, fried foods and saturated fats, processed meats and grains, dairy, caffeine and alcohol. These foods can disrupt gut bacteria, spike insulin levels, and bolster inflammation. Identifying and eliminating your food sensitivities via IgG Blood testing or an elimination diet can be a very helpful next step.\nWondering what those anti-inflammatory foods are? The good news is they are delicious.\n1. Eat Raw, Organic Fruits & Veggies\nOrganic foods are a great place to start when looking to adhere to a more anti-inflammatory diet. Grown in mineral-dense soil, organic foods tend to be more alkalizing and have a higher vitamin and mineral content.\nIn order to keep those vitamin and mineral levels high, it’s also helpful to eat raw fruits and veggies, which are also known as life-giving foods. Cooking can deplete minerals, which is why it’s important to take every opportunity you can to get eat fresh and raw so you get to enjoy the full nutritional benefits. For example, Vitamin K is found in dark leafy greens like broccoli and spinach, and is excellent for reducing inflammation.\n2. Add in lots of Alkaline foods\nIn addition to fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes are also alkaline foods that can help balance your pH and reduce acidity. While being mindful of your body’s pH, you might be wonder about the impact of acidic foods, like tomatoes or citrus, and how they affect inflammation. Surprisingly these foods don’t create acidity in the body. Instead they may actually help to restore your pH balance. Even apple cider vinegar is alkaline-forming (however, other vinegars are not).\n3. Fish & Plant Proteins\nBelieve it or not, most high protein foods, like meat, can actually be acid forming. In this case, plant proteins, such as almonds and beans, are great alternatives to reduce acidity and inflammation.\nNeed your meat? Then eat more fish. Fish oils, as well as other foods rich in healthy fats like omega 3, are proven to have a variety of health benefits, including significant anti-inflammatory effects.\nFish is also a great source of Vitamin D. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with a wide range of inflammatory conditions.\nGrass-fed meats are a good option if you prefer red meat, due to their higher concentration of conjugated linoleic acid and omega 3s.\n4. Antioxidant-Rich Foods\nThose susceptible to chronic inflammation may also benefit from supplementing their diets with food sources that contain bioactive molecules. For example, curcumin is the compound found in turmeric root that gives curry its bright yellow color. A powerful antioxidant, curcumin’s ability to reduce brain inflammation has been shown to be beneficial on both Alzheimer’s disease and major depression. Curcumin has been shown to not only prevent memory problems from worsening, but also to improve them.\nComplement your curry with a little watercress salad on the side, including pears, dill weed, onion and chives – all sources of the antioxidant known as isorhamnetin.\nAdd a little red wine and some berries for dessert, which are rich in resveratrol, and you’ve got yourself an anti-inflammatory party. Resveratrol is an antioxidant produced by certain plants in response to injury or when under attack by bacteria or fungi. This is what makes dark-coloured grapes and berries such excellent health boosters for your body.\nAnd of course, you can’t forget the dark chocolate! The flavonoids found in cacao are extremely potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents, which are great for your brain and your heart. New research also shows that consuming dark chocolate with a high concentration of cacao (minimum 70% with 30% organic cane sugar) has a positive effect on stress levels and inflammation, while also improving your memory, immunity and mood. You read that right – chocolate really is good for you (but make sure its good quality and that you are not over doing it).\n5. Going Beyond Diet- get your stress in check!\nWhile diet definitely plays a role, stress is also a major contributor to inflammation in the body. Stress can be triggered by lack of sleep, lifestyle changes, or any other number of factors. Getting a good night’s rest and making time to meditate or practice other stress-reducing activities, like yoga or Tai chi, are also very effective ways to promote good health and reduce inflammation.\nAll it takes is a few conscious decisions about your diet and lifestyle and you are on your way to a healthier you.\n​\nAre you dealing with chronic health issues triggered by inflammation?\nDo you still have more questions about how you can make greater changes towards a pain-free life?\nDo you want a customized approach to managing inflammation and preventing disease?\n​\nPlease feel free to contact our clinic and we can find your best solutions together.

The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) trial will provide eight online sessions to people in the comfort of their own home. At the moment, such supports are scarce and generally aimed at the self-management of specific chronic conditions, such as diabetes or chronic pain.\nResearch has shown that having multiple chronic conditions, also known as multimorbidity is associated with a number of negative outcomes, such as a decline in physical and mental functioning, a decreased quality of life and a greater risk of mortality. The ACT trial is based on emerging clinical science that demonstrates the usefulness of managing health conditions through mindfulness and psychological well-being.\nThe study is open to people all over Ireland and will take place over the coming months. GPs and other health professionals around the country are being encouraged to refer suitable people to the study.\nThe free online sessions in the ACT programme will focus on values and goals that are individual to each person in the trial. Participants will be provided with instructions on a range of activity-pacing techniques to encourage more consistent levels of activity from day-to-day.\nDr Brian Slattery, coordinator of the study at the Centre for Pain Research, NUI Galway, says: “We know that psychological therapies provided to people with chronic conditions are beneficial, but can be hard to access. In this trial, we will offer this online programme to people all over the country, with any combination of conditions, to try alongside any existing treatments they are already using.”\nPeople who take part in the ACT trial will not need to attend any clinic or the University at any stage. All materials are tailored for those wishing to learn effective ways of managing their health conditions. Participants can access physiotherapy and all medical services as usual while involved in the trial. Study supervisor Dr Brian McGuire, NUI Galway, said: “This is a promising new online pain management programme and we are hopeful it will be of benefit to people with multimorbidity.”\nFor further information, please contact the research team at the Centre for Pain Research, NUI Galway, email painresearch@nuigalway.ie, or phone 091 495832. GPs or physiotherapists who are interested in referring suitable patients to the trial can also use these contact details.\nDo you know or are you the parent of a teen (age 10 - 16) suffering from chronic pain?

        "description": "Patients' preferences for subcutaneous trastuzumab versus conventional intravenous infusion for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer: final analysis of 488 patients in the international, randomized, two-cohort PrefHer study : Sussex Research Online\nOfficial URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdu364\nBACKGROUND: Patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer (EBC) preferred subcutaneous (SC) trastuzumab, delivered via single-use injection device (SID), over the intravenous (IV) formulation (Cohort 1 of the PrefHer study: NCT01401166). Here we report patient preference, healthcare professional satisfaction, and safety data pooled from Cohort 1 and also Cohort 2, where SC trastuzumab was delivered via hand-held syringe.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive 4 adjuvant cycles of 600 mg fixed-dose SC trastuzumab followed by 4 cycles of standard IV trastuzumab, or vice versa. The primary endpoint was overall preference proportions for SC or IV, assessed by patient interviews in the evaluable ITT population. RESULTS: A total of 245 patients were randomized to receive SC followed by IV and 243 received IV followed by SC (evaluable ITT populations: 235 and 232 patients, respectively). SC was preferred by 415/467 (88.9%; 95% CI, 85.7-91.6; P<.0001; two-sided test against null hypothesis of 65% SC preference); 45/467 preferred IV (9.6%; 7-13); 7/467 indicated no preference (1.5%; 1-3). Clinician-reported adverse events occurred in 292/479 (61.0%) and 245/478 (51.3%) patients during the pooled SC and IV periods, respectively (P<.05; 2x2 chi2); 16 patients (3.3%) in each period experienced grade 3 events; none were grade 4/5.\nCONCLUSION: PrefHer revealed compelling and consistent patient preferences for SC over IV trastuzumab, regardless of SID or hand-held syringe delivery. SC was well tolerated and safety was consistent with previous reports, including the HannaH study (NCT00950300). No new safety signals were identified compared to the known IV profile in EBC. PrefHer and HannaH confirm that SC trastuzumab is a validated and preferred option over IV for improving patients' care in HER2-positive breast cancer.\nPharmacology | Fidelta\nFideltaServicesPharmacology\nIn Vitro Pharmacology In Vivo Pharmacology Toxicology Translational\nIn vivo experiments are performed in a state-of-the-art animal facility with continuous AAALAC-I accreditation status since 2008 and OLAW accreditation since 2018.

Immediately after completion of excision study (BC003, 2002-2003), one-arm prospective follow-up study to evaluate MRgFUS followed by adjunct radiation therapy (BC004) has been running wiht no local and systemic recurrences among 67 cases at Breastopia Namba Hospital in Japan. We report completion of excision study (BC006), the goal of which is, similar to BC003, prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, multiinternational study, and is to develop data to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Exablate 2000™ (InSightec, Israel) in the ablation of breast cancer by histopathological evaluation of MRI-guidance and the effect of FUS.\nTotal of 5 eligible patients agreed to join this study after IC, May, 2012 - Feb, 2014 at Hokuto Hospital, Obihiro, Japan, after IRB’s approval. All lesions were diagnosed as discrete invasive ductal carcinoma wiht a maximal size of <2cm by ultrasound-guided vacuum biopsy (Vacora™ 10 gauge, BARD, USA) and 3T MRI (Signa HDxt, 3T, 8 channel Breast Coil, GE, USA). All the patients underwent ablation with MRgFUS. The goal of MRgFUS ablation of breast cancer is to plan and ablate the entire tumor volume in a treatable and device accessible location (lesion planned for ablation that is a minimum distance from unintended structures: dermal under surface, nipple complex and/or ribs shouls be 1.0 cm as defined by procedure day MR contrast-enhanced imaging, and with margins of 5-10mm by MRgFUS. MR imaging with and without MR contrast was performed at 10-21 days post ablation in order to assess the effectiveness of MRI in identifying residual disease. Pathological analyses will be performed on all excised samples to assess the endpoints of this study.\nMedian age was 64 ± 13 (51 - 81). All were invasive ductal carcinoma and luminal A. MRgFUS was all tolerated with a minimum of adverse effects. On pathological examination, Median necrosis of the targeted breast tumors was 97.5% ± 2.5(95 - 100%) of tumor volume. The Median % area of carcinoma within the treatment field was 98 ± 2% (96% - 100%). Retrospective analysis in two patients with residual tumor showed treatment was not delivered to the full recommended area, reaffirming the need for precise localization and the value of contrast-enhanced images for treatment planning. Adverse effect were mild except one patient who complained of moderately uncomfortable feeling in the ablated area of the breast in one patient only during the treatment.\nWe sincerely appreciate all six patients and their families in the local area who sincerely volunteered to cooperate this study with profound understanding of the goal of this study despite in their anxious state immediately after diagnosis of breast cancer. We are grateful with Sharon Thomsen, MD for meticulous pathological work, Mr. Jair Bauer in supporting the entire treatment.

Currently, chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR-T) for lymphoproliferative diseases such as B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and B-cell lymphoma have yielded encouraging therapeutic effects. However, clinical study on the efficacy of CAR-T in multiple myeloma is just at beginning. B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) displays restricted expression on plasma cells and is regarded as a potential therapeutic target in myeloma patients. In this one arm trial approved by the IRBs of the participating hospitals, bi-epitope targeting CAR-T with specificity against BCMA (LCAR-B38M) was used to treat R/R multiple myeloma. As of 2017-7-31, 5 patients (RJ01-03, CZ01-02, including 2 females and 3 males; average age: 51 years) were enrolled in the study. Their Ig subtypes were: IgG lamda in 2 cases, IgG kappa in 2 cases and IgD lamda in one case. Relapse occurred in all patients after treatment with classical chemotherapy, immunomodulatory drugs and proteosome inhibitors, 3 of them had also received autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Plasma cells accounted for 3% in one case (RJ03) and 22 to 69% in 4 cases among BM cells. BCMA was positive on plasma cells in all cases. Plasma M-proteins were at abnormally high levels (11.52-64.53g/L) in all these cases, and free light chains were positive in 4 cases but negative in the case RJ03. Of note, two patients exhibited extramedullary lesions. One bore plasmacytoma on the forehead and the other presented extramedullary involvement in the lower jaw, chest skin and liver. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) detected high risk chromosome abnormalities in 3 cases, including one with 1q21 amplification, one with TP53 deletion, and one carried both of these two abnormalities. Split FISH signal of IGH was detected in 2 cases, though not juxtaposing to the common known high risk partner genes.\nPatients underwent leukopheresis to collect T-cells for the preparation of BCMA-specific CAR-T. Pre-CAR-T treatment was performed with fludarabine (25mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (250mg/m2) daily for 3 days (d-5~d-3). A dose of 0.17 or 1.05×106 (median=0.62) CAR-T cells per kilogram of body weight was intravenously infused on three days (d0, d2, and d6). At one month after CAR-T treatment, all 5 patients achieved an objective response, 1 achieving immunophenotypic complete remission, 1 reaching very good partial remission and 3 obtaining partial remission. Figure 1 shows the return to negativity of BM minimal residual disease and serum M protein in the case RJ01 at two months post CAR-T. Notably, large subcutaneous masses seen in two patients (RJ02, RJ03) were significantly reduced after treatment (Figure 2a and 2b). Peripheral blood CAR-Ts were consistently detected after infusion (Figure 3). The most common adverse effects were the high fever and hypotension attributable to cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and were manageable with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or tocilizumab. The fluid was supplemented to maintain the blood pressure in case of need. No dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related deaths were observed. Therefore, BCMA-specific CAR-T represents a promising safe therapeutic approach for R/R multiple myeloma, including cases with severe extramedullary invasions.\nFigure 1.

The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (generally considered to be the most reliable source of evidence) was searched in January 2010. Cochrane reviews with the term \"homeopathy\" in the title, abstract or keywords were considered. Protocols of reviews were excluded. Six articles met the inclusion criteria.\nEach of the six reviews was examined for specific subject matter; number of clinical trials reviewed; total number of patients involved; and authors' conclusions. The reviews covered the following conditions: cancer, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, asthma, dementia, influenza and induction of labour. The findings of the reviews were discussed narratively (the reviews' clinical and statistical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis).\nThe reviewer concluded: \"The findings of currently available Cochrane reviews of studies of homeopathy do not show that homeopathic medicines have effects beyond placebo.\"\nAn expected finding, although it would be preferable to see a study with more rigour making such a point.\nMJA 192(8):458-460, 19 April 2010 © The Medical Journal of Australia 2010\nHomeopathy: what does the \"best\" evidence tell us?

        "description": "Lipoma Removal Surgery - InfoBarrel\nLipoma is the medical term for the thin layers of fatty tissue that has been known to grow in various places on one's body. One person may have several areas that are subject to the growth of lipoma; in some cases the patient may only have one affected area. A sign of lipoma is generally an uncomfortable sensation when the deposit of fat is touched, or subject to some form of physical contact. Rare cases of lipoma have reported several severe symptoms that indicate a crucial need for lipoma removal by surgical means.\nLocation of Lipoma Removal Surgery\nRemoval of lipoma deposits may be performed at local hospitals, or specified facilities. The surgery is relatively easy and may be completed by nearly any qualified surgeon. Performed as an outpatient procedure, the patient is generally able to arrive for the procedure alone and leave the hospital in under two hours. Exceptions apply to severe cases and cases that consist of an affected patient with several lipoma deposits.\nAnesthesia is injected locally at the site of the lipoma deposit, unless the lipoma is located in an area that is complicated for the surgeon to reach. In the event of inconveniently located lipoma, an anesthetic is applied through general means to provide the patient with a near pain free surgery. In addition, the patient is awake during every minute of the procedure allowing for the patient to be released from the hospital sooner than patients are typically released after surgeries requiring the patients to be put into an anesthetic induced sleep.\nAfter administering the anesthetic to the patient, the surgeon begins removing the tissues the form the lipoma deposit. Removal of the tissue starts with a small incision in the affected area, followed by the extraction of fat tissues that make up the lipoma deposit. After the tissues are removed from the affected area, the surgeon proceeds to stitch up the incision with sutures. It is reported that the procedure usually takes no longer than twenty minutes, allowing for increased availability of scheduling for lipoma removal. In general, a patient may arrive for the surgery, receive the surgery and be released in approximately ninety minutes time.\nImportance of Removing Lipoma\nRemoving lipoma is deemed unnecessary by specialist, as well as insurance companies. An exception is made in cases where the patient is affected by severe symptoms, symptoms severe enough for the patient to desire medical attention. The severe cases of lipoma show physical symptoms that consist of; occurrence of sensitivity that sends waves of pain through the affected area when subject to physical contact, emission of any pus or liquids that emit an unpleasant scent or signs of the lipoma deposit becoming infected. For the cases with severe symptoms, lipoma removal is critical and will be covered by any insurance company due to the severity of the symptoms.\nTreatment and Special Instructions\nAfter the surgery, the patient is provided with treatment instructions and options for relieving any side effects caused by the surgery. Given that the surgery is small and requires less incisions and procedures, the pain or soreness that occurs around the affected area after surgery may easily be relieved by pain medications that are available without a prescription.\n3D PRINTING IN PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGY: A REVIEW | Semantic Scholar\nDOI:10.7897/2230-8407.100234\nCorpus ID: 116728597\n3D PRINTING IN PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGY: A REVIEW\n@article{Srinivas20193DPI,\ntitle={3D PRINTING IN PHARMACEUTICAL TECHNOLOGY: A REVIEW},\nauthor={Lakshmi Srinivas and M.

No Coding Technology makes Abbott Freestyle Lite Test Strip more accurate and less confusing than many other brands available today. The world's smallest sample size of just 0.3 microliters is all the meter needs to get accurate blood glucose readings.\nAbbott Freestyle Lite Test Strip support alternate site testing, so you can test from your fingertip, palm, forearm, upper arm, thigh, or calf. The meter's Coulometry system means that it is unaffected by many of the factors that can make testing problematic.\nFree Style Lite Test Strips Features\nNo Coding Required: This makes it easier and more convenient to begin testing. Coding meters is a time-consuming and frustrating process, as any diabetic knows; without having to code your meter, you're on your way to accurate testing much more quickly.\nYou can test using your fingers, forearm, upper arm, hand, thigh, calf and palm. When testing for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or if you have hypoglycemia unawareness, it is recommended that you use your finger only. Hypoglycemia unawareness is when a patient feels few or no symptoms of initial low blood-glucose levels. This is especially common in those who frequently have such episodes, as the repetition can dull sensitivity to the signs.\nA small sample size of just 0.3 microliters of blood is all that is required. Some other meters require samples of 1.0 or even 1.5 microliters—more than triple what the FreeStyle Lite requires.\nAccurate blood glucose results are available in merely 5 seconds. When you aren't sure what your blood-glucose levels are, time is frequently of the essence, and a few seconds faster can mean a much better outcome for an acute problem—whether hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic.\nTo make a significant contribution to humanity through medical research by expanding our understanding of the secrets of life, and by improving life’s quality through innovative approaches to the causes, treatment and prevention of diseases.\nThe Stowers Institute for Medical Research was established in 1994 through the extraordinary generosity of the late James “Jim” E. Stowers Jr., the founder of American Century Investments, and his wife Virginia G. Stowers, who dedicated their personal fortune to improving human health through basic research.\nSituated on the former campus of the Menorah Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri, the 600,000-square-foot research facility was thoughtfully designed to provide state-of-the-art laboratory space, equipment and technical support—but above all—to encourage collaboration between scientists.\nIn the year 2000, three years after breaking ground, the Stowers Institute opened its laboratory doors to welcome the first generation of Stowers scientists. In 2009, the Institute added a 280,000-square-foot complex in South Kansas City to accommodate additional support functions and storage facilities.\nThroughout the Institute’s history, from the earliest planning stages to the latest addition of new faculty members, an external Scientific Advisory Board, comprised of seven members of the National Academy of Sciences, has been providing independent advice and guidance on the scientific direction of the Institute.\nToday, the Institute houses more than 20 independent research programs and several technology development programs. Of the nearly 550 Institute members, about 370 are scientific staff: principal investigators, technology center directors, postdoctoral research associates and fellows, pre-doctoral research associates, and technical support staff.\nThe research programs at the Stowers Institute focus on basic biomedical research in genetic model organisms as a way to understand how cells function and to decipher what goes wrong when they malfunction. Stowers investigators analyze how genes and proteins control virtually all biological processes; from cell division to cell differentiation; from processing smells to storing fat; from generating memories to regenerating missing body parts.\nAs strong believers in endowment-based scientific research, the Stowers family endowed the Institute with gifts totaling close to $2 billion. Their ultimate goal was to free scientists from the pressures of securing their own funding, allowing them to solely focus their talent and energy on scientific research.\nIn addition to thriving research programs and continued growth, the Institute launched a graduate training program in the fall of 2011.\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are all effective for childhood anxiety, a new systematic review and meta-analysis suggests.\nIn light of these findings, study investigator Zhen Wang, PhD, of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, told Medscape Medical News the choice of treatment for pediatric anxiety should be based on \"values, preferences, availability of services, and adverse effect profile.\"\nThe study was published online August 31 in JAMA Pediatrics.\nChildhood anxiety disorders are the most common mental health diagnoses, with prevalence rates of 15% to 20%. They are associated with significant impairment, the researchers note.\n\"Rates of anxiety and depression seem to be increasing in youth, although we don't know this with certainty. But it has been hypothesized to be related to the challenges of modern society, especially fewer opportunities to connect with others,\" said Dr Wang.\nThe investigators note that although multiple treatment options are available, existing guidelines provide inconsistent advice on which to use.\nThe meta-analysis and systematic review included 115 randomized as well as nonrandomized comparative trials. The trials included a total of 7719 patients with a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder who received CBT, pharmacotherapy, or a combination of the two. The mean age of the patients was 9.2 years, and 4290 (55.6%) were female.\nAnxiety disorders included separation anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Other sources of childhood anxiety included panic disorder or a specific phobia.\nOutcomes of interest were primary anxiety symptoms, treatment response, and clinical remission.\nThe investigators found that compared with placebo, SSRIs were significantly more effective at reducing primary anxiety symptoms, with increased remission (relative risk [RR], 2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.37 - 3.04) and response (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.60 - 2.40).\nThey also found that SNRIs significantly reduced clinician-reported primary anxiety symptoms. In contrast, benzodiazepines and tricyclics had no significant effect on anxiety systems.\nCompared to wait-list/no treatment, CBT significantly improved primary anxiety symptoms, remission, and response. Combination treatment with sertraline (Zoloft, Pfizer) and CBT significantly reduced clinician-reported primary anxiety symptoms and response more than either treatment alone.\nIn addition, the investigators found that CBT reduced primary anxiety symptoms more than fluoxetine did and improved remission more than sertraline did.\nSSRIs and SNRIs were often associated with adverse events, but these events were generally not serious and typically did not lead to discontinuance of treatment. However, the investigators note that the studies were either too small or too short to allow assessment of suicidality that may have been associated with these medications.\nFew adverse events were reported for CBT, but Dr Wang noted that most CBT studies did not evaluate the study participants for the occurrence of adverse events.\n\"Head-to-head comparisons between various medications and comparing with CBT represent a need for research in the field,\" the investigators conclude.\nFull Remission Remains Elusive\nIn an accompanying editorial, Joan Rosenbaum Asarnow, PhD, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, and colleagues also note the high prevalence of anxiety in youth and the fact that these disorders can become more severe in adulthood.\n\"From a clinical perspective, the key issues are how many children will recover, how much recovery is expected, and how rapidly will recovery occur,\" the editorialists write.\nThe most rigorous of the randomized trials reviewed by Dr Wang and colleagues was the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study, which included patients aged 7 to 17 years who had been diagnosed with separation anxiety, generalized anxiety, or social phobia.\nAmong the cohort who received the combination of a SSRI and CBT, more than 80% showed \"much or very much\" clinical improvement at the end of 12 weeks of treatment, compared with 55% for those receiving an SSRI alone and 60% for those receiving CBT alone.\nPatients treated with the SSRI plus CBT, as well as those treated with an SSRI alone, also improved more quickly, with patients showing signs of symptom alleviation relative to placebo by 4 weeks.\n\"Therefore, current evidence indicates that treatment with demonstrated efficacy in the reviewed trials can yield substantial improvements in anxiety symptoms within a relatively brief period,\" the editorialists write.\nOn the other hand, they also note that it is \"equally and arguably more important\" to take into account the effect treatment has on school attendance and overall social performance.\nDr Asarnow and colleagues point out that relatively few of the studies that were included in the meta-analysis provide any indication of the durability of the effects of treatment on anxiety symptoms.\n\"This important limitation is underscored by the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study findings that approximately half of youth receiving gold-standard CBT, SSRI, or CBT plus SSRI treatments experienced diagnostic recurrence within 6 years of initial treatment,\" they write.\n\"[T]his means that full remission is not expected for many children, even with our best treatments,\" they conclude.\nThe study was funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The authors and editorialists have disclosed no relevant financial relationships.\nNovartis launches FocalView app for trial participation\nNovartis has launched the FocalView app, an ophthalmic digital research platform designed to allow researchers to track disease progression by collecting real-time data reported from consenting patients.\nBy adapting the design of clinical trials for patients' daily routines, the app may reduce barriers to study participation, the company said in a press release.\nThe app will help patients complete assessments and gain feedback on their visual function, including changes over time. It can also provide researchers with real-world, patient-reported data to create more flexible and accessible trial designs.\nThe app will be tested for efficacy and usability in assessing visual function, including visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, in a prospective, non-interventional study. Researchers will evaluate the app's ease of use, patient enrollment and ability to obtain documentation for future research, according to the release.\nFocalView is available for download in the United States. User consent to contribute to research data will be required before interaction with the tool is allowed.\nmens' health | DT - Your Daily Health News DT - Your Daily Health News > mens' health mens' health\nmens' health 0\nTips For Choosing The Right Gynecomastia Surgeon\nEven though Gynecomastia is not a life threatening situation, you still need to pay attention to it. Normally it will go away without needing any kind of treatment especially for men that are in their adolescence stage. But if you have had Gynecomastia for more than a year already, you might want to look at the possibility of undergoing the male breast reduction procedure. And just like any other procedures that you will go through, you need to make sure that you have the right professional to help you resolve it. You need to avail of the services of a surgeon that you can trust.\nWhat should you be looking for in a surgeon? Here are the qualities that you should look at in your surgeon in order for you to have confidence in him or her.\nVisit: gynecomastia.org for more information!\nBoard Certification. This is the best indicator of what particular surgical or medical specialty a surgeon has. People in the UK should look for a gynecomastia surgeon that has a certification with the General Medical Council (GMC).\nPlastic surgeons that have a good amount of experience have done different kinds of cosmetic surgeries. As a patient, you need to ask the surgeon what kind of experience he has on a particular procedure.\nFacility Accreditation. There are different places where cosmetic surgery can be successfully done. It can be done in hospitals, surgicenters and surgical centers that are based in the office. But you need to take note that a lot of office-based surgical facilities do not have accreditation.\nHospital Privileges. Check if the surgeon has the privilege to operate in the hospital where the procedure is going to be performed. Review committees of hospitals will evaluate the competency and training for particular procedures.\nReliable References. You can start by asking your general physician for recommendations. Your friends that have undergone the same procedure might also have recommendations. But what is important is you independently verify the board certification of the recommended doctor.\nIf you have any questions about your condition and the procedure then the best time to ask them would be during consultation. For a consultation o be thorough, your complete medical history should also be reviewed. Risks of the procedure should also be discussed along with the benefits. Customizing the operation based on these factors will ensure that the patient is getting what he needs.\nNo surgeon is right for every patient. Good patient-doctor relationships are developed when there is good communication between the two parties. So opt for a surgeon that you can talk to and discuss matters with you.\nFollow-up Care. The care that you should get from your surgeon does not end when the surgery is finished. Typically, surgeons will want to monitor how you are doing and take a look at the result. So you need to ask the surgeon regarding follow-up check-ups and policies regarding revision of surgeries should you require it.\n\"So an EKG that would tell you the rhythm, what the heart rate variability is, what the heart rate response to exercise and stress is; how quickly your heart rate and rhythm return to normal after exercise.\n\"A non-invasive way to measure cardiac output in real time and continuously would be highly valuable too, as would a measure of vascular health that's meaningful and actionable.\"\nAnd then there's stress, something that some wearable manufacturers are starting to look more carefully at. Being able to get an accurate measurement of physical and emotional stress over prolonged periods, along with accurate diet activity - another realm wearables are edging further into - would be beneficial also.\nIn order much of this data to start making sense for doctors a lot of things have to change, but whether it will come from tech companies or the industry itself is as yet untold.\nWhen You Should Go to Urgent Care for Flu - MedHelp\nFlu, also known as influenza, is a contagious virus that spreads through respiratory droplets. Two main types of flu - Flu A and Flu B - typically circulate in humans. Flu season in Alabama usually lasts from November to late May, and it peaks in the late winter months.\nThe prevalence of flu will change from season to season. The more cases of flu there are in your community, the more likely you are to be exposed to the flu. You can check the CDC Flu Tracker to monitor flu activity in your area.\nThere is an overlap of symptoms of flu with COVID-19 and other influenza-like illnesses. Symptoms of flu and influenza-like illnesses include:\nSymptoms of flu typically appear 1 to 4 days after you've been infected, and you usually feel better from the flu in 7 to 10 days. Flu also comes on rapidly, while a cold or COVID-19 will come on a little more slowly. Because so many symptoms overlap, it's impossible to tell the difference between flu and COVID-19 without a test.\nBefore the onset of COVID-19, it was advisable to take a wait-and-see approach with the flu. If you have not had a previous COVID infection, you should get tested for both COVID and the flu if you have any flu-like symptoms.\nGet tested as soon as you start to have symptoms. Knowing what has caused your illness will help you know how to mitigate spread and how best to treat your illness. You can get tested for both flu and COVID-19 at any MedHelp urgent care clinic.\nSome cases of flu will be more severe. If you have any of the following symptoms, you should go to the nearest ER:\nDifficulty breathing, especially when at rest\nWhat your urgent care doctor can do for the flu\nIf your flu is detected early (usually within two days of getting sick), your urgent care doctor may prescribe antiviral treatment such as Tamiflu. Antiviral treatment can shorten the duration of your illness and possibly reduce the severity of your flu symptoms, but it is not a cure. Antiviral treatment isn't for everyone, and antivirals aren't the same as antibiotics. Your flu will resolve without an antiviral prescription.\nDepending on your symptoms, your doctor may also recommend a steroid injection. When your immune system is weakened, you may develop secondary infections such as pneumonia, so your doctor may also recommend a chest x-ray.\nWhat you can do for the flu\nIf you do get the flu, avoid contact with others for 5 to 7 days from the onset of symptoms. You can still be contagious without a fever.\nWhile you're recovering from the flu, make sure to get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. You can also take over-the-counter medications such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen to reduce your fever and relieve aches and pains\nEveryone over the age of six months old should get vaccinated for the flu each year. The annual flu vaccine is designed to protect against the most common flu strains circulating in a given year. The flu shot is the best way to protect yourself against the flu each year.\nResearch also indicates that the flu shot can also offer some unique benefits in the context of COVID-19, making it less likely that you'll contract COVID or develop severe complications from COVID-19 if you are infected."

        "description": "JAX Assistant Professor Jennifer Trowbridge. Photo by Tiffany Laufer.\nAs we age, we grow more likely to develop cancer. Jennifer Trowbridge wants to know why, specifically, older people are more likely to get acute myeloid leukemia (AML).\n\"The link between cancer susceptibility and aging is very well established,\" Trowbridge says. \"And in the blood system we grow more susceptible to particular types of blood tumors. We're looking at changes in the stem cells that are responsible for building blood cells but develop cancer cells instead.\"\nThe average age of onset of AML is 67, with slightly more men than women getting the disease. Chemotherapy is effective in about two-thirds of patients, but older patients don't respond as well. As with all cancers, the earlier AML is detected, the better the prospective outcome, but today there is no screening test to find AML before symptoms occur, and the symptoms themselves — which include weight loss, fatigue, fever and night sweats — could point to any number of other conditions or diseases.\nWe're looking at changes in the stem cells that are responsible for building blood cells but develop cancer cells instead.\nThe Canadian-born Jackson Laboratory associate professor has figured out a way to profile blood tumor cells that offers a powerful new prognostic tool, and is now exploring strategies for targeting AML before it even starts.\nJoining JAX for her first faculty position in 2012, following her postdoc at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Children's Hospital in Boston, Trowbridge has already published research in top journals and has captured the attention of several prominent funding organizations. She has earned a New Scholar Award in Aging from The Lawrence Ellison Foundation, a National Cancer Institute Provocative Questions Initiative award, a Maine Cancer Foundation grant and a newly announced V Scholar award from The V Foundation for Cancer Research.\nTrowbridge's postdoc mentor was Stuart Orkin, M.D., David G. Nathan Distinguished Professor of Pediatrics and Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Harvard Medical School, who is also on the external advisory board of the JAX Cancer Center. \"Jen has the uncanny ability to focus on the critical issues and then design her experiments to address them clearly,\" Orkin says. \"Always upbeat and enthusiastic, Jen has always been a terrifically positive person. These traits make for a strong foundation, and have allowed her to transition to her independence smoothly and rapidly, becoming an important faculty member at JAX.\"\nDespite all of her precocious success, Trowbridge didn't start out planning to be a research scientist. Though she enjoyed math and science as a kid, by her senior year at the University of Western Ontario she was on a path to become a genetic counselor. But one lecture on signaling pathways in stem cell biology by a new faculty member sparked a passion for exploring genetic mechanisms.\n\"The thing I liked about genetic counseling,\" Trowbridge says, \"was the idea of interacting directly with people, and being able to feel like I was making a difference in their lives. But this professor was addressing genetic diseases directly, and showed me a different path to helping people.\"\nGenetics counseling in the genomic eraPatients and physicians rely on genetics counselors to understand the avalanche of new genetic tests and help them make smart medical decisions about what the tests reveal.\nFired up to go to graduate school in immunology and stem cell biology, but with only basic genetics and biochemistry courses under her belt, Trowbridge emailed the lecturing professor, Mick Bhatia, to ask whether he would take her on as a grad student. Bhatia declined but Trowbridge persisted, asking one of her professors to \"please talk to him and tell him that I'm smart and I have good hands in the lab and I'll work really hard, and that he should let me be in his lab.\"\nBhatia, who is now Canada Research Chair in human stem cell biology at McMaster University, agreed to be Trowbridge's mentor. \"Having had many graduate students before,\" Bhatia says, \"I suggested directions where techniques and preliminary data were available, so she could continue on a pre-developed track. This, however, was not a regular graduate student.\n\"A few months after her arrival, Jen would walk into my office and sit on the carpeted floor, where she insisted she was more comfortable. There would start discussions about the conceptual framework of experimentation, how controls for the variables could be designed and what interpretations from the experiments (that I later learned she was already doing) could be drawn out. These starting discussions were clearly the end of my contributions as a supervisor, and I quickly realized I had a stem cell biologist peer.\"\nBhatia adds, \"It's a delight to watch her achieve her goals, although I too often look at my empty carpet floor and miss Dr. Trowbridge.\"\nTrowbridge would, in fact, have made a first-rate genetic counselor. She has a serene, calm demeanor and listens thoughtfully, ignoring the frequent \"pink\" sounds of incoming emails on her computer. The people in her lab describe her as caring and supportive. She's also a family woman who — with her husband Mike Kiers, a nurse at the local hospital and, like Trowbridge, tall and athletic — has two young sons and is expecting a daughter in the spring.\nLike most principal investigators, Trowbridge has to spend most of her time at her computer, writing grant proposals and drafting research papers. This morning she has carved out time in her lab to meet with her small staff for a progress check on the quest to understand what goes wrong in AML.\nAll blood cells start from a common origin, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). HSCs in turn produce more specific progenitor cell types, each of which are responsible for producing various kinds of blood cells: red, white (including myeloid cells) and platelets.\nOver the years, the stem cell compartment in the bone marrow expands, but that's not good news: Some of the stem cells it cranks out don't function properly and instead produce more of the myeloid cell types, which increases the chance of these cells becoming cancerous.\nThis approach is kind of another dimension. It's an incredibly precise tool for looking at the big picture of a cancer.\nData from AML patients show that the stage of a progenitor cell when it becomes transformed to leukemia has an impact on its clinical progression, with earlier-stage cell of origin cancers being more aggressive. But how can you triage the different kinds of cells to determine the cells of origin?\nIn what could be described as a conceptual discovery, Trowbridge found a framework to sort out and evaluate tumor cells: their open chromatin profiles.\nChromatin is the material in the cell's nucleus that condenses to form chromosomes during cell division. Just as every species of tree produces leaves of a certain shape, every type of cell has a characteristic chromatin profile: a distinctive combination of closed (tightly wound and relatively inactive) and open (looser and more active) chromatin.\n\"We realized we could analyze open chromatin in bulk tumor cells,\" Trowbridge says, \"to determine what kind of cell the tumor had developed from. That cell-type specificity of chromatin structure provides a major clue for diagnosis and treatment.\"\nWorking with a mouse model of AML, the Trowbridge lab began with five distinct, normal cell types found in bone marrow: long-term HSCs, short-term HSCs, multipotent progenitors, common myeloid progenitors and granulocyte macrophage progenitors. The AML that developed from these different cells of origin had varying levels of aggressiveness when engrafted in mice, with the stem cell-derived lines being the most aggressive.\nTo profile the open chromatin in these distinct AML samples, and compare them to open chromatin patterns in normal cells, Trowbridge collaborated with Duygu Ucar, Ph.D., a JAX assistant professor who develops computational models to study gene regulation including chromatin structure. Together they identified open chromatin signatures and gene expression patterns in AML samples that enabled them to distinguish the more aggressive, stem-cell-derived AML.\n\"This approach is kind of another dimension,\" Trowbridge says. \"It's an incredibly precise tool for looking at the big picture of a cancer. It reveals what's happening in terms of how the cancer cells are behaving, where they've come from, what they've been exposed to and, potentially, what's going to be effective to treat them.\"\nUcar describes Trowbridge as \"a dream collaborator\" for a computational scientist. \"It's a great pleasure to work with her. She generates top-quality data and asks very smart research questions.\"\nBack in her office, Trowbridge reflects on the struggles inherent in being a principal investigator in today's complex research environment, which she describes as finding a balance between positivity and realism.\n\"I've learned that it's okay to have to lean on somebody else, to ask somebody for help, to collaborate with somebody because you can't get this particular technique to work and they're an expert in it. Working with Duygu is a perfect example of this.\"\nBy the same token, she says, \"The hardest lesson that I have had to learn is to know when to cut a project, because it's not going as well as you had hoped and you're just sinking a lot of resources and time into it. Ultimately it does better justice to the process and to science to be able to make those difficult decisions.\"\nExploring the science of agingJAX computational scientist Duygu Ucar bridges the worlds of biology and computer science to unlock the secrets of aging and age-related disease.\nThe treatment of non-malarial febrile illness in Papua New Guinea: findings from cross sectional and longitudinal studies of health worker practice | BMC Health Services Research | Full Text\nThe treatment of non-malarial febrile illness in Papua New Guinea: findings from cross sectional and longitudinal studies of health worker practice\nOlga P. M. Saweri1,\nIvo Mueller4,5,\nPeter M. Siba1 &\nJustin Pulford ORCID: orcid.org/0000-0003-4756-84801,6\nBMC Health Services Research volume 17, Article number: 10 (2017) Cite this article\nThe Papua New Guinea Department of Health recently shifted from a presumptive to a 'test and treat' malaria case management policy. This shift was supported by the widespread introduction of malaria rapid diagnostic tests in health facilities across the country. Health workers received training and job-aids detailing how to conduct and interpret a malaria rapid diagnostic test and how to treat test positive cases; however, little instruction on treating non-malaria febrile cases was provided. Accordingly, this study examined health worker case management of non-malarial febrile patients in the 12-month period immediately following the introduction of the revised malaria case management policy.\nData were collected from a country-wide cross-sectional survey of febrile case management at randomly selected health facilities and from longitudinal surveillance at sentinel health facilities. Analysis was restricted to febrile patients who tested negative for malaria infection by rapid diagnostic test (N=303 and 5705 outpatients, respectively).\n96.8% of non-malarial febrile patients received a diagnosis in the longitudinal sample, compared to 52.4% of the cross-sectional sample. Respiratory tract infections were the most commonly reported diagnoses. Over 90% of patients in both samples were prescribed one or more medications, most commonly an analgesic (71.3 & 72.9% of the longitudinal and cross-sectional samples, respectively), some form of antibiotic (72.7 & 73.4%, respectively) and/or an anthelminthic (17.9 & 16.5%, respectively). Prescribing behaviour was adherent with the recommendations in the standard treatment guidelines in fewer than 20% of cases (longitudinal sample only).\nMany non-malarial febrile patients are not provided with a diagnosis. When diagnoses are provided they are typically some form of respiratory tract infection. Antibiotics and analgesics are widely prescribed, although medications prescribed rarely adhere to the Papua New Guinea standard treatment guidelines. These findings indicate that Papua New Guinea health workers require support for non-malarial febrile illness case management.\nThe last 5 to 10 years has seen a substantial increase in the availability and use of malaria Rapid Diagnostic Tests (mRDTs) in many parts of the world [1]. Consistent with these global trends, Papua New Guinea (PNG) with support from a Round 8 Global Fund grant has procured over three million mRDTs since 2010 [2]. This supports a revised national malaria treatment policy (NMTP) stipulating that all fever or suspected malaria cases be tested for malaria infection by microscopy or mRDT [3]. Internationally, the scale-up of mRDT availability has often led to substantial reductions in antimalarial prescription as health workers shift from a presumptive to a 'test and treat' malaria case management approach [4–6]. There is some evidence to suggest a similar change in health worker practice is occurring in PNG. A recent study found that antimalarial prescriptions to febrile patients declined from 96.4% of cases before the introduction of the test and treat policy to 39.0% in the 12-month period immediately post-implementation [7]. The availability of mRDTs increased from 8.9% of surveyed facilities to 53.4% across the same time period.\nWhilst mRDTs can confirm or rule out malaria infection, they provide no support to health workers for diagnosing and treating non-malarial fevers. Fever is an unspecific syndrome and diagnostic tools to assist in the accurate identification of its aetiology in mRDT negative patients are scarce in resource-poor settings [8]. The historic practice of presumptive malaria diagnosis may further undermine the quality of non-malarial febrile case management as the health workforce has little acquired experience in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of non-malarial febrile patients [9]. Many febrile patients attending PNG health facilities test negative for malaria infection and the malaria burden is declining in the general population [10, 11]. Thus, the health workforce is increasingly, and quite suddenly, required to respond to febrile illnesses shown to be non-malarial in origin via mRDT.\nA health worker training program was carried out in PNG pre-implementation of the new NMTP. This program provided detailed instruction on mRDT use and strongly emphasised the importance of restricting antimalarial prescription to test-confirmed cases [12]. Nevertheless, the training program provided relatively little detail on non-malarial febrile case management beyond reference to an Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) flowchart. No instruction on the management of non-malarial febrile illness in adolescent or adult patients was provided. The PNG National Department of Health and the Paediatric Society of PNG issues standard treatment guidelines which outline recommended management of a range of common illnesses, including non-malarial febrile illness [13, 14]. Apart from these reference manuals, no other training, resources or support have been specifically provided to assist the PNG healthcare workforce manage the increasing number of non-malarial febrile illness cases identified in the context of the new NMTP. Accurate diagnosis of non-malarial febrile illness is further comprised by the absence of on-site laboratory support at most primary health care facilities in PNG [15]. The general lack of curative treatments for most viral febrile illnesses may be an additional obstacle to implementing accurate evidence-based treatment.\nThis paper examines how the PNG primary healthcare workforce diagnosed and treated non-malarial febrile patients in the period immediately following the widespread introduction of mRDTs. The primary research questions included: what percentage of non-malarial febrile patients are provided a recorded diagnosis? What diagnoses are being recorded? What medications are being prescribed? And to what extent do the medications prescribed adhere with national standard treatment guidelines?\nThis paper presents selected data from a multifacted evaluation of the PNG National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), 2009–2014. A full description of the NMCP evaluation is available elsewhere [16]. Reported data were obtained from longitudinal, outpatient surveillance in seven sentinel health facilities and a cross sectional survey completed in 36 randomly selected health facilities across the country. The longitudinal dataset provided a large number of febrile cases, although the respective case management of these patients was provided by a relatively small number of health workers working within a quasi-research environment. The cross sectional dataset provided fewer clinical cases, but these cases were clinically managed by a greater number of health workers from across a greater number of health facilities in a routine clinical environment. The datasets are considered complementary as, together, they provide clinical case management records pertaining to non-malaria febrile illness for over 6000 patients from 43 health facilities.\nOutpatient surveillance was variously initiated in seven sentinel primary health care facilities across PNG between January 2010 and July 2011. The primary aim of the surveillance was to assess trends in malaria morbidity. The seven facilities were purposively selected from a sampling frame of operational public-sector health centres provided by the PNG Department of Health according to their accessibility, their functionality, their geographical spread and the local malaria epidemiology and were located in Balimo (Western province), East Cape (Milne Bay province), Karimui (Chimbu province), Sausi (Madang province), Dreikikir (East Sepik province), Lemakot (New Ireland province) and Arawa (Autonomous Region of Bougainville). For the purpose of this paper, focus is placed on data collected in the calendar year 2012 as the revised NMTP was implemented in November, 2011.\nDaily surveillance was carried out at each health facility during regular opening hours (Monday to Friday, 7.45 am-4.06 pm). Outpatients presenting with fever or a history of fever, in the past 3 days, were referred to a study nurse who then completed an mRDT, prepared a thick and thin blood smear on a microscopy slide and measured haemoglobin (Hb) level using a Hemocue Hb 201+ analyser (HemoCue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden). Demographic details of the patient were recorded in a one-page case report form alongside clinical signs and symptoms, previous health facility attendance and drug intake, axillary temperature, weight and results of the mRDT and Hb measurement. The patient was then transferred to a member of the respective facility's health work force for further examination, diagnosis and treatment following routine procedures. The resulting diagnosis and any prescription by the health worker were recorded on the case report form. Oral informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to participation.\nThe sample consisted of primary health care facilities randomly selected as part of a countrywide cross sectional health facility survey in which at least one instance of febrile case management has been observed by a member of the research team. The sampling frame consisted of all primary health care facilities operational at the time of the survey. Health facilities were stratified by province and selected using a simple random sampling procedure. Sample size was determined by logistical considerations.\nThe survey was carried out between June and November 2012. Research officers spent between 1 to 5 days at each participating health facility (depending on size). Up to four different survey instruments were completed at each health facility, although this paper only reports data obtained from the non-participant observation of febrile case management (described below). Oral informed consent was sought from the officer in charge at all participating health facilities and from all participating clinicians and patients prior to clinical observation. More details of the general survey methodology have been published elsewhere [7].\nA structured checklist was designed to record observed features of the clinical case management of patients presenting with fever or a recent history of fever. The instrument was divided into discrete sections including consultation and diagnosis, prescription and treatment counseling. The content of each section was informed with input from experienced medical- and medical research- professionals. The instrument was completed by a trained research officer who would passively observe the management of fever patients from the point of initial contact with a health professional until service exit or admission onto a treatment ward. During the course of this observation, the research officer recorded on the structured clinical observation instrument whether specified actions did or did not occur and recorded the content of specific actions (e.g., whether an mRDT was conducted and, if yes, the outcome). Eligible patients were identified upon first contact with a health worker or, if circumstances allowed, by screening in the waiting area prior to first contact with a health worker.\nAll data were double entered into DMSys version 5.1 (Sigma Soft International). Stata versions 11/IC and 12/SE were used for descriptive data analysis and to assess health worker adherence to prescription guidelines. The analysis of health worker adherence to prescription guidelines was limited to the ten most frequently recorded diagnoses and to patients with a single recorded diagnosis. Patients with multiple diagnoses were not included as it was not possible to determine which medications were prescribed for which diagnosis. To be rated 'adherent' the medications prescribed were required to be consistent with those listed against the specified diagnosis in either the Papua New Guinea Standard Treatment Guidelines for Adults [14] or Children [13], as listed in Table 1. A rating of 'partially adherent' was given when at least one (but not all) of the listed medications for the specified diagnosis were prescribed or the same class of medication was prescribed, but not the recommended drug. A rating of 'non-adherent' was given when the medication/s prescribed was/were neither the recommended drug nor the same class of medication as stated in the aforementioned manuals. The analysis of health worker adherence to prescription guidelines did not account for drug dosages and was not applied to the CS sample due to the large number of cases without a recorded diagnosis. Between-group differences in the mean number of medications prescribed and type of prescription were examined by two-tailed t-tests and chi-square, respectively, in the CS sample.\nTable 1 Recommended medications for specified diagnoses according to the Papua New Guinea Standard Treatment Guidelines for Adults and Children\nA total of 5705 patients with fever or recent experience of fever tested negative for malaria by mRDT across the seven sentinel sites in 2012. Of these patients, 50.9% were female, 42.3% were <5 years of age, 18.7% were between 5 and 15 years of age and 39.0% were 16 years of age or older.\nA diagnosis was recorded for 96.8% (5521/5705) of the outpatient surveillance (OS) sample. Of outpatients with a recorded diagnosis, 88.9% (4906/5521) had one recorded diagnosis and 11.1% (615/5521) had two or more. Overall, a total of 6152 diagnoses were recorded of which 87.6% (5391/6152) appear in the Papua New Guinea Standard Treatment Guidelines for Adults [14] or Children [13]. A full list of the recorded diagnoses is available in Additional file 1. The ten most frequently recorded diagnoses, accounting for 72.6% (4469/6152) of all diagnoses, included: Pneumonia (n = 824), Cough (n = 790), Respiratory Tract Infection (n = 613), Malaria (n = 510), Anaemia (n = 452), Fever of Unknown Origin (n = 399), Otitis Media (n = 286), Diarrhoea (n = 274), Flu (n = 233) and Worms (n = 88).\nAll participants included in the OS sample were tested for malaria and anaemia using diagnostic tests. These were the only two diagnostic test results routinely recorded that allow the accuracy of the respective diagnosis to be assessed. By definition, all participants included in the OS sample tested negative for malaria infection by mRDT; however, 8.9% (510/5705) were given a recorded diagnosis of malaria all of which would be considered incorrect according to mRDT result assuming absence of signs of severe malarial disease (7/510 malaria diagnose were recorded as 'severe malaria'). Anaemia was defined, by the Papua New Guinea Standard Treatment Guidelines, as any patient presenting with Hb less than 10 g/dL. A Hb level lower than 5 g/dL indicates severe anaemia. Overall, 27.4% (1561/5705) of the OS sample tested positive for either moderate (n = 1481) or severe anaemia (n = 80). Of these 1561 patients, 24.9% were formally diagnosed with anaemia.\nNinety-six point five percent (5508/5705) of the OS sample were prescribed one or more medications, the number, percentage and type of which are depicted in Table 2. The mean number of medications prescribed (analysis restricted to patients prescribed at least one medicine) was 1.8 (Median 1; IQR 1–2). Overall, antibiotics were the most commonly prescribed medication (72.7%), followed by analgesics (71.3%) and anthelminthics (17.9%). One or more antimalarial medications were prescribed to 13.2% (753/5705) of the OS sample, the most common of which were sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (SP) (8.1%), chloroquine (4.2%) and amodiaquine (3.6%). 58.6% (441/753) of these patients received some form of antimalarial combination, the most common of which were SP plus chloroquine (21.1%), and SP plus amodiaquine (19.1%). Artemether monotherapies were prescribed in 2.9% (22/753) of cases.\nTable 2 Number, percent and type of prescribed medications by survey type\nHealth worker adherence to prescription guidelines\nAs shown in Table 3, a total of 3249 patients met the inclusion criteria for this analysis of whom 16.6% received a prescription in adherence with the standard treatment guidelines for their respective diagnosis. The majority of prescriptions (56.3%) were rated 'partially adherent', 21.8% 'non-adherent' and a rating was unable to be made in 5.4% of cases.\nTable 3 Health worker adherence to prescription guidelines relative to recorded diagnosis\nTable 4, drawing on the same sample as presented in Table 3 and further limited to those patients for whom it was possible to provide an 'adherence' rating (n = 3075), presents the percentage of participants for whom: according to the respective prescription protocols in the PNG standard treatment guidelines, (1) should have been prescribed an antibiotic and were not (under prescription); and (2) should not have been provided an antibiotic and were (over prescription). As shown, 18.7% of patients in the five diagnostic categories in which an antibiotic should have been prescribed did not receive an antibiotic. Conversely, 41.0% of patients in the five diagnostic categories in which an antibiotic should not have been prescribed did receive an antibiotic.\nTable 4 Antibiotic prescription relative to diagnosis, according to Papua New Guinea Standard Treatment Guidelines\nA total of 303 febrile patients tested negative for malaria by mRDT or microscopy. Of these patients, 50.8% were female, 47.9% were <5 years of age, 19.5% were between 5 and 15 years of age and 32.7% were 16 years of age or older. These patients were collectively observed across 36 health facilities in 17 provinces.\nA diagnosis was only sought for mRDT negative patients not prescribed an antimalarial (n = 246) as those prescribed antimalarials (n = 57) were assumed to have been diagnosed with malaria despite the mRDT result. Of these 246 patients, a diagnosis was recorded in 52.4% of cases. The specified diagnoses indicated some form of respiratory tract infection (n = 80), general body aches or headache (n = 28), fever (n = 11), diarrhoea (n = 9), ear infection (n = 7), shortness of breath (n = 7), sore mouth/throat (n = 5), influenza (n = 4), viral infection (n = 3), malaise (n = 3), vomiting (n = 2), food poisoning (n = 2) and one each of measles, tuberculosis, anaemia, gastroenteritis, swelling, bleeding eye, pregnancy and hypertension.\nOf the 117 mRDT negative patients without a recorded diagnosis (or prescribed antimalarials), 94.0% (110/117) were prescribed some form of medication suggesting the health worker formed a clinical opinion as to the cause of the febrile illness even if this opinion was not formally recorded or reported to the patient.\n97.0% (294/303) of the CS sample were prescribed one or more medications, the number, percentage and type of which are listed in Table 2. The mean number of medications prescribed (analysis restricted to patients prescribed at least one medicine) was 2.1 (Median 2; IQR 2–3). Overall, antibiotics were the most commonly prescribed medication (73.4%) followed by analgesics (72.9%). One or more antimalarial medications were prescribed to 18.8% (57/303) of the CS sample despite the negative mRDT result. The most commonly prescribed antimalarials were SP (13.9%), amodiaquine (6.9%) and chloroquine (6.6%). The recommended first line medication for uncomplicated malaria, artemether-lumefantrine, was prescribed in 1.0% (3/303) of cases. 13.9% (42/303) of these patients received some form of antimalarial combination, the most common of which were chloroquine plus SP (6.6%), amodiaquine plus SP (5.0%) and artemether/artesunate plus SP (1.7%). Artemether monotherapies were prescribed in less than 1.0% (2/303) of cases.\nExcluding patients prescribed an antimalarial (for whom diagnostic information was not sought), there was no statistically significant difference in the mean number of medications prescribed to mRDT negative patients with a recorded diagnosis as compared to those without a recorded diagnosis (2.0 vs. 1.9; t = −0.3, p = 0.76). Furthermore, mRDT negative patients not provided a diagnosis were as likely to receive an antibiotic (75.9% vs. 73.1%; χ 2 = 0.7, p = 0.42) or analgesic (71.6% vs. 76.2%; χ 2 = 0.7, p = 0.41) as those with a recorded diagnosis suggesting prescribing behaviour was similar irrespective of whether a formal diagnosis was recorded or not.\nThis paper presents data pertaining to the clinical case management of non-malarial febrile patients in the 12-month period immediately following the discontinuation of a treatment protocol in which most febrile patients were presumptively treated with antimalarials. Data were derived from longitudinal surveillance in seven outpatient sentinel health facilities and from a cross sectional survey in 36 health centres across 17 provinces in PNG.\nFindings from the OS sample indicate that the vast majority of non-malarial febrile patients had a formal diagnosis recorded, in the CS sample this was little more than 50%. As the latter comprised a greater number of health workers, and as these health workers were not prompted to provide a diagnosis (as was the case in the OS sample), then the CS percentage may be the more accurate reflection of standard practice. Respiratory tract infections, often pneumonia, were the most common diagnosis provided across both datasets. Diagnoses of diarrhoea and general body aches were also prominent across samples, although at a substantially lower frequency. Respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea have historically been reported at a high frequency on the PNG National Health Information System [17] and are ranked highly in PNG burden of disease estimates [18]. Thus, the specified diagnoses of non-malarial febrile illness are largely consistent with existing data sources.\nIt was not possible to determine whether the recorded diagnoses were accurate or not in the context of this study, with the exception of malaria and anaemia. However, the small number of studies that have examined the aetiology of non-malarial febrile illness in PNG have identified dengue as a cause in approximately 10% of cases [19, 20] and a chikungunya virus outbreak was detected in PNG at the time the reported data were collected [21, 22]. A recent review of non-malarial febrile illness in the neighbouring South East Asia region further identified dengue, typhus and Leptospira spp. as the most commonly reported pathogens across 146 studies meeting the inclusion criteria [23]. As neither dengue, chikungunya, typhus or leptospira spp. were diagnosed in a single case in either sample, as malaria was diagnosed in between 8.9 to 18.8% of mRDT-negative cases and as anaemia was substantially underdiagnosed despite the availability of a Hb-measurement in the OS sample, there is reason to question the accuracy of recorded diagnoses. The limited diagnostic/laboratory support available in primary health care facilities in PNG restricts the degree to which health workers can investigate the causes of febrile illnesses and may consequently influence the accuracy of diagnoses provided. The threat of misdiagnosis may, therefore, be considered a result of limitations in the broader healthcare system rather than health worker ability per se.\nPrescription patterns were consistent across datasets. Over 90% of patients in both the OS and CS sample were prescribed one or more medications, most commonly some form of antibiotic, analgesic and/or anthelminthic. Antimalarials were provided in 18.8 and 13.2% of OS and CS cases, respectively, despite the negative mRDT result. This rate of antimalarial prescription to mRDT negative patients is lower than that reported in other settings [24–26] and represents a substantial reduction in the rate of antimalarial prescription to febrile patients compared to the practice observed prior to the change in treatment protocol [27]. Thus, while not fully compliant with the revised protocol, PNG health workers have seemingly made radical and appropriate adjustments to their antimalarial prescription practices in a relatively brief time frame and perhaps at a faster rate than their international peers in similar circumstances.\nThe adherence analysis indicated that the prescription provided was consistent with that recommended in the respective PNG standard treatment manual for the specified diagnosis in fewer than 20% of cases (OS sample only). The majority of prescriptions (56.3%) were rated 'partially adherent', indicating that at least one, but not all, of the recommended medications was provided or the correct class of medication was provided, but not the recommended drug. It was not possible to determine what influence the availability of the respective medications played in this outcome. This result, therefore, most likely reflects limitations in both medication availability and health worker practice, yet it remains the case that the medications provided were rarely in full accordance with those recommended for the diagnoses given. A previous study, not restricted to mRDT negative cases, reported 'appropriate' prescription rates (based on diagnosis) of between 62.1–69.6% in two secondary care settings and an outpatient facility in PNG [28]. Thus, the relatively poor adherence to prescription guidelines reported in this study suggests that PNG health workers may be less likely to provide a recommended prescription when treating non-malarial febrile illness patients. However, in the absence of an expert reference diagnosis in the context of this study, the extent and consequences of any potential misdiagnosis and non-recommended prescription cannot be judged.\nPrevious studies have reported similar rates of antibiotic prescription to mRDT negative patients as reported here, from 61.4% in Uganda [29] to 78% in Tanzania [30]. Accordingly, the rates may be considered somewhat normative in a low income country setting in which a shift from presumptive to parasitological confirmed malaria diagnosis has recently taken place. Nevertheless, the rate of antibiotic prescription is high and raises the possibility that primary health care workers in PNG may be substituting antimalarial medication with antibiotic medication in response to the revised NMTP, as has been previously suggested [6, 9]. The potential over-prescription of antibiotics cannot be reliably established in the absence of an expert reference diagnosis including, in some instances, additional diagnostic testing; nevertheless, a recent study reported unnecessary antibiotic prescription in 29% of 6969 observed illness episodes in outpatient health services in PNG [31] which is somewhat consistent with the rate of antibiotic over prescription (41%) reported herein. Furthermore, an analysis of medication prescription to malaria mRDT positive patients in the CS survey [7] found that out of 54 mRDT positive patients, 98.2% were prescribed an antimalarial, yet only 14.8% were prescribed an antibiotic. This would indicate that health workers are selectively (and often unnecessarily) prescribing antibiotics to mRDT negative cases as opposed to routinely providing them to all febrile patients.\nThis study was not without limitation. Firstly, the fact that (to a large extent) the accuracy of the reported diagnoses was not able to be assessed in either the OS or CS sample remains an important knowledge gap. Whilst assessing the accuracy of non-malarial febrile illness was not an aim of the study, without this essential information it is difficult to reliably assess the quality of health worker practice. A further limitation is that the study did not take into consideration medication supplies at the respective health facilities in either survey. The supply of anti-malarial drugs or other medications could have an implied effect on the prescribing behaviour of health workers [32]. In addition, health workers in the OS sample were required to complete a diagnosis and medication section on a research-specific case report form which is not reflective of normal practice and health workers in the CS sample were actively observed during their respective febrile case consultations by a member of a research team. This, too, may have influenced health worker practice. The health workers in both surveys were predominantly nurses and community health workers. Therefore, the conclusions drawn concerning health worker behaviour are not a complete depiction of all health worker cadres in PNG.\nThe respective datasets also had their inherent weaknesses. The OS analyses were based on a large number of patient cases, yet they had been collectively treated by a relatively small number of health workers. Conversely, the CS analyses were based on a smaller number of patients, yet they had been treated by a larger number of health workers from a more diverse array of health facilities. Triangulating findings from the two datasets, as was done here, overcomes their respective limitations in part. Despite these limitations, the collective sample size of both patients and health workers, the relatively robust sampling and study protocols, the geographical spread of participating health centres and the general agreement between the two datasets with respect to reported diagnosis and prescription practice suggests the reported findings could reasonably be generalised to health centres across PNG.\nThe findings indicate health workers predominantly adhere to mRDT negative results, determine alternative diagnoses in most cases and provide medications other than antimalarials. However, the findings further suggest that a large proportion of non-malarial febrile patients are not being provided a diagnosis, the diagnoses that are given may not necessarily be accurate, the medications prescribed rarely fully adhere to those recommended for the specified diagnosis and that antibiotics are likely to be overprescribed. All of these factors strongly indicate a need for intensive and continuing health worker support in the diagnosis and management of non-malarial fevers and for thorough scientific investigation and reporting on the aetiology of non-malarial fevers across the various regions of PNG.\nInterventions based on training and/or the provision of rapid diagnostic tests have demonstrably improved non-malarial febrile case management [33], and interventions proven successful in improving malaria case management, such as text message reminders [34], would seemingly be easily transferable. General health systems strengthening in low income country contexts such as PNG is equally essential to sustained improvement in health worker performance [35]. As multiple support and supervisory mechanism are typically required to improve health worker practice [36], strengthening non-malarial febrile case management in primary health care contexts in PNG will likely require a package of health worker and health system strengthening interventions, variously focusing on: further reducing antimalarial prescription to malaria mRDT negative patients; encouraging formal diagnosis and the use of clinical and available laboratory resources to inform diagnosis; rational use of antibiotics; and adherence to recommended treatment guidelines when a diagnosis is made.\nNMTP:\nNational Malaria Treatment Protocol\nOutpatient longitudinal surveillance\nZhao J, Lama M, Korenromp E, Aylward P, Shargie E, Filler S, et al.

METHODS: We selected two hospitals each from four of Kenya's eight provinces with the aim of representing the diversity of this part of the health system in Kenya. We created a checklist of 53 indicator items necessary for providing essential basic care to newborns and assessed their availability at each of the eight hospitals by direct observation, and then compared our observations with the opinions of health workers providing care to newborns on recent availability for some items, using a self-administered structured questionnaire. RESULTS: The hospitals surveyed were often unable to maintain a safe hygienic environment for patients and health care workers; staffing was insufficient and sometimes poorly organised to support the provision of care; some key equipment, laboratory tests, drugs and consumables were not available while patient management guidelines were missing in all sites. CONCLUSION: Hospitals appear relatively poorly prepared to fill their proposed role in ensuring newborn survival. More effective interventions are needed to improve them to meet the special needs of this at-risk group.\nAttitude of Health Personnel, Clinical Competence, Female, Health Facility Environment, Humans, Infant, Newborn, Kenya, Male, Maternal-Child Health Centers, Needs Assessment, Practice Guidelines as Topic, Practice Patterns, Physicians', Pregnancy, Quality of Health Care, Referral and Consultation, Surveys and Questionnaires\nPPT - Doubletree Hotel Seattle Airport Seattle, Washington June 21, 2008 PowerPoint Presentation - ID:190039\nDoubletree Hotel Seattle Airport Seattle, Washington June 21, 2008 PowerPoint Presentation\nDoubletree Hotel Seattle Airport Seattle, Washington June 21, 2008\n<iframe src=\"https://www.slideserve.com/embed/190039\" width=\"600\" height=\"497\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px;margin-bottom:5px;max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe>\nmoriuchi k\nParts 1 and 2 - . faculty/presenter disclosure. disclosure of commercial support. this program has received financial\nDoubletree Hotel Seattle Airport Seattle, Washington June 21, 2008 2008 Symposia Series 2\nStrategies for Preventing Herpes Zoster and Postherpetic Neuralgia: Are Your Patients Adequately Protected?

The performance of PD patients (n = 40) was contrasted with healthy controls (n = 42) across two separate visits (on and off dopaminergic medications) on computerized tasks of perception and aiming to a target at variable stimulus lengths (4, 8, 12 cm). Novel visuoperceptual tasks of length equivalence and width interval estimations without motor demands were compared with tasks estimating spatial deviation in movement termination. The findings support the presence of spatial deficits in early PD, more pronounced with increased discrimination difficulty, and with shorter stimulus lengths of 4 cm for both visuoperceptual and perceptumotor functions. Dopaminergic medication had an adverse impact on visuoperceptual accuracy in particular for length equivalence estimations, in contrast with dopaminergic modulation of perceptuomotor functions that reduced angular displacements toward the target. The differential outcomes for spatial accuracy in perception versus movement termination in PD are consistent with involvement of the direct pathway and models of progressive loss of dopamine through corticostriatal loops. Future research should develop validated and sensitive standardized tests of perception and explore dopaminergic selective deficits in PD to optimize medication titration for motor and cognitive symptoms of the disease.\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/10713/17085\nDifferential effects of dopaminergic medication on basic motor performance and executive functions in Parkinson's disease.\nAuthors: Michely J, Barbe MT, Hoffstaedter F, Timmermann L, Eickhoff SB, Fink GR, Grefkes C\nDifferent effects of dopaminergic medication on perceptual decision-making in Parkinson's disease as a function of task difficulty and speed-accuracy instructions.\nAuthors: Huang YT, Georgiev D, Foltynie T, Limousin P, Speekenbrink M, Jahanshahi M\nDopaminergic contributions to distance estimation in Parkinson's disease: a sensory-perceptual deficit?\nAuthors: Ehgoetz Martens KA, Ellard CG, Almeida QJ\nDissociable effects of dopaminergic therapy on spatial versus non-spatial working memory in Parkinson's disease."

Get Vaccinated.”\nThe North Carolina Department of Health and Humans Services has expanded the list of higher-risk people who are eligible to receive the monkeypox vaccine to help prevent spread in the state.\nRaleigh\nJul 25, 2022\nThe North Carolina Department of Health and Humans Services has expanded the list of higher-risk people who are eligible to receive the monkeypox vaccine to help prevent spread in the state.\nVaccinations to protect against monkeypox are now available for:\nAnyone who had close contact in the past two weeks with someone who has been diagnosed with monkeypox, and\nGay or bisexual men or transgender individuals who report any of the following in the last 90 days:\nHaving multiple sex partners or anonymous sex\nBeing diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection\nReceiving medications to prevent HIV infection (PrEP)\nWhile monkeypox can affect anyone through close skin to skin contact, our data show that currently almost all cases in North Carolina and across the country have been in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men,” said NCDHHS Secretary Kody H. Kinsley. “Everyone in our health system across the state should be working quickly to increase use of testing and vaccinating those most at risk so we can contain this outbreak.”\nTo date, 533 doses have been administered across the state. The federal government has allocated 4,548 doses of vaccine to North Carolina enough to fully vaccinate approximately 2,300 individuals with the recommended two-dose vaccination series. These doses have been distributed to nine local health departments (contact information below) that are offering vaccine and working with other health departments and clinics to ensure availability of vaccine throughout the state. More vaccine is expected in the coming weeks. Vaccine is free and available for individuals meeting the criteria above.\nVaccination after recent exposure may reduce the chance of getting monkeypox and can reduce symptom severity if you do get monkeypox. Those interested in receiving the vaccine should contact their local health department to find out whether they are eligible and to schedule an appointment.\nData shared by NCDHHS indicates more than 60% of monkeypox cases reported so far in North Carolina have been in Black/African American men.\n“It’s very concerning to see disparities emerging in our monkeypox cases,” said State Epidemiologist Zack Moore, M.D., MPH. “We are working with our partners to raise awareness of monkeypox in LBGTQ+ communities of color and to making sure vaccines and other resources are reaching this community so they can take steps to decrease their chances of getting monkeypox.”\nEarlier this month, NCDHHS released the 2022 Monkeypox Outbreak Response Plan (Spanish) encouraging people to get checked, get tested and get vaccinated.\nFirst, get checked. If you’ve had skin-to-skin contact — including sex — with someone with monkeypox, see a health care provider. If you have bumps, sores or a rash that looks like blisters or pimples, see a health care provider. Call your local health department if you don’t have a provider.\nSecond, get tested. Testing is widely available and encouraged if you have symptoms of monkeypox. Samples must be collected by a health care professional. NCDHHS recommends providers be vigilant and test any patient with a suspicious lesion or sore.\nThird, get vaccinated. Vaccines are available for those who meet the criteria above. These criteria will be reassessed and likely expanded as more vaccines become available over the coming weeks. Most people with monkey pox infection get better on their own. Therapies are available and may be recommended for people with a high risk of severe illness.\n\"Health care providers are the key link in getting checked, getting tested and getting protected,\" said Elizabeth Cuervo Tilson, M.D., MPH, State Health Director and NCDHHS Chief Medical Officer. \"We want to emphasize that testing is widely available, and anyone with symptoms should be tested.\"\nMore information on testing, vaccines, treatment and where to find additional resources and contact information for local health departments is below.\nTesting\nThere is plenty of testing capacity. The NC State Laboratory of Public Health, many commercial labs and some health systems have testing capability, and more labs will have testing capability soon. Health care providers can send tests to the State Laboratory of Public Health or a commercial lab. Every healthcare provider should have a plan for getting their patients tested for monkeypox when they need it.\nVaccines\nVaccine, known as Jynneos, has been allocated by the federal government and distributed to nine local health departments. The locations are sharing vaccine with other health departments and various clinics within North Carolina to ensure availability of vaccine throughout the state. Vaccine is free and available for individuals meeting the criteria above. Vaccination after recent exposure may reduce the chance of getting monkeypox and can reduce symptom severity if you do get monkeypox. People interested in receiving the vaccine can schedule an appointment through their local health department or one of the nine LHDs listed below. Currently, pharmacies are not able to administer the vaccine.\nTreatment\nMost infections last two to four weeks, and most people with monkeypox get better on their own without treatment. Antiviral therapies are available for those who are more likely to be severely ill, including people with lesions in the mouth, eye area, genitalia or rectum, and people with weakened immune systems. Monkeypox is rarely fatal, and no deaths have been reported related to this outbreak worldwide. The North Carolina interim therapeutic guidance for physicians can be found here. North Carolina physicians who wish to order tecovirimat can do so here.\nFor more information on symptoms and transmission of monkeypox, visit the NCDHHS Division of Public Health PH website here.\nAdditional Resources\nNCDHHS is maintaining additional resources on its monkeypox web page. A count of North Carolina cases is now displayed at the top of the page. A communications toolkit is available, as well as guidance for providers and local health departments.\nAccountant at IU Health credits doctors for saving his life in high school - TheIndyChannel.com Indianapolis, IN\nAccountant at IU Health credits doctors for saving his life in high school\n10:49 PM, Nov 13, 2017\nA man who credit's doctors at IU Health with saving his life in high school now works for the hospital. Doctors found kidney stones and said he contracted Staph infection.\nINDIANAPOLIS – A recent Ball State graduate found his first job out of college at the place where doctors were credited with saving his life years ago.\nDrew Heydon, an accountant for IU Health, said he's thrilled to work for the hospital.\n\"IU Health helped take care of me and I got my education,\" said Heydon. \"I was able to go through all of that and then come back around and work for them now. I'm really happy with how it all ended up.\"\nDuring his high school football days, Heydon missed his first football game after he felt a mysterious pain in his back.\nDoctors said Heydon had kidney stones and Staph Infection. Heydon said he doesn't remember the moment he contracted the infection, but it could've been a month earlier when he busted his lip while on the field.\n\"It tends to cause a very severe disease,\" said Dr. Cole Beeler. \"It's resistant to a lot of antibiotics that we normally treat bacteria with. If Staph has made its way into the blood stream, you need to have IV therapy for a long time.\"\nHeydon said he is lucky doctors caught the infection early enough and he was able to get back on the football field.\nBeeler said parents who have children playing sports should be aware that:\nStaph Infections can be hard to treat because the bacteria likes to stick itself to parts of the body like the heart or bones\nThe bacteria develops toxins that harm the body\nSigns of infection include weakness, fever, fatigue and redness similar to a spider bite\nThe best way to prevent the infection is to wash your hands, wipe down equipment, and avoid sharing razors, towels and uniforms\nAberrant interactions of cortical networks in chronic migraine: A resting-state fMRI study. - PubMed - NCBI\n1 selected item: 31053665\nCoppola G1, Di Renzo A1, Petolicchio B1, Tinelli E1, Di Lorenzo C1, Parisi V2, Serrao M1, Calistri V1, Tardioli S1, Cartocci G1, Schoenen J1, Caramia F1, Di Piero V1, Pierelli F1.\nFrom the Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies (G.

We used MRI to collect RS data in 3 selected networks, identified using group ICA: the default mode network (DMN), the executive control network (ECN), and the dorsal attention system (DAS).\nCompared to HC, CM patients had significantly reduced functional connectivity between the DMN and the ECN. Moreover, in patients, the DAS showed significantly stronger FC with the DMN and weaker FC with the ECN. The higher the severity of headache, the increased the strength of DAS connectivity, and the lower the strength of ECN connectivity.\nThese results provide evidence for large-scale reorganization of functional cortical networks in chronic migraine. They suggest that the severity of headache is associated with opposite connectivity patterns in frontal executive and dorsal attentional networks.\nComplications Post Liver Transplant - Liver Disorders - MedHelp\nCommunities>Liver Disorders>Complications Post Liver Transplant\nMyMomsTransplant_LivingDonor\nMy mom had a living donor liver transplant back in January 2010 in China. in 2013 she started her HCV treatment and since they she has been un-detected for HCV (HCV free). She did pretty good after the transplant for about ~3 years. In December 2013, we took her to a reputable hospital in NC (liver transplant center) and they diagnosed her with liver rejection and found ascites in her abdomen.\nIn the events/months that followed they did several liver biopsies (Biopsy show Stage 2 Fibrosis) and have found two strictures in the Portal Veins (which they opened by stents) a stricture in the bile duct (also opened by a stent). Despite all this her ascites kept coming back and her overall health worsened. In the start her ascites was red but then changed to white but recently has changed to red again.\nIn July 2014 she went through a Abdomen Laproscopy to find out the cause of the ascites but the team found nothing. She came out with SBP post surgery which they treated with antibiotics.\nSeveral MRI, CT Scans, Ultrasounds and Cancer Screening Markers tests were conducted but nothing was found.\nHer ascites contained high levels of lymph and therefore the doctors suggested we do a Lymph angiogram. The lymph angiogram found a blockage in her lymph vessels. They put her on a fat free diet. Within 2 weeks of the fat free diet her Biliruben started to shoot up. They did an ERCP and found a stenosis in the bile duct and put a stent in there. At this point her ascites had started turning red from white again.\nRecently the hematologists have asked for another biopsy and another venogram which was conducted last Friday. The vengoram showed high portal pressure but the biopsy showed Stage 2 Fibrosis and an early evidence of bridging fibrosis.\nShe has been HCV free for about 18 months. She has had no history of acute rejection.\nQuestions to the doctors on this forum is (especially Dr Sachiano) what do you think is going on here? Here AST is 60, ALT 30, Biliruben two month ago was 1 but now is ~19.\nThe hepatologist has maintained her Tac levels at 3 to 4 (0.5 mg ONCE a day).\nHi I am so sorry to hear your Mom is having problems.\nI wish there was a doctor here.\nWhat did your Mom treat her HCV with?\nI am asking because you mentioned her bilirubin was high.\nIf you can let me know I will try to search for some answers for you.\nHi I found this, not sure it will help. I wish we had doctors here, we have not had any since the summer.\nMedhelp is working on it.\nhttp://www.medhelp.org/posts/Liver-Transplant/bilirubin/show/1586564\nShe got treated with interferon and riboflavin for 6 months. She has had multiple HCV test that all came back negative.\nVery difficult issues for both her and you. Did they measure her HVPG before and after the resolution with her portal vein strictures? And do they think that surgery had anything to do with those strictures?\nClearly things are inconsistent with stage-2 from the liver biopsy but with chronic ascites present. Keep in mind her liver damage may likely be patchy so the biopsy sample may have simply missed the more troubled zones. If it's not an obvious portal vein thrombosis or anything downstream obstructing the hepatic vein, then her liver is suspect. Just wondering if the previous stricturing has caused some liver patchy liver damage. That should be visible though in an dynamic contrast enhanced MRI.\nWishing good luck and keep us informed.\nHi I am glad to hear that your Mom was able to kill the virus, that is very good news.\nThere is another forum where people help each other, it is called the cirrhosis forum, there are a lot more people there. Some have had transplants and they are very knowledgeable.\nNew study aimed at diminishing phantom pain suffered by amputees\nVerdell Dukes, one of the first patients to complete the cryoablation therapy at Emory Saint Joseph's, describes her experience with phantom limb pain and the results of the new treatment.\nA new clinical trial conducted by Emory Saint Joseph's Hospital interventional radiologist J. David Prologo, MD is studying a minimally invasive investigational treatment known as cryoablation therapy, hoped to help relieve symptoms in amputees with residual and phantom limb pain.\nAs the principal investigator of the study, Prologo is using CT imaging guidance to place a probe near the nerve responsible for the residual phantom pain.\nOnce the probe is precisely placed, the temperature is dropped for 25 minutes to create an ablation zone, and the signals the nerve was previously carrying are shut down. The outpatient procedure takes approximately one hour, and some patients have reported significantly decreased pain and improved function.\nNorma Jean Robinson, one of the first patients to complete the cryoablation therapy at Emory Saint Joseph's, has seen her pain drop to a minimum after the amputation of her leg six months ago.\n\"On a scale of one to 10, my pain had reached the highest level — a 10,\" she says. \"Having this procedure has dramatically changed the quality of my life.\"\nFor more information about this study, contact the Emory University School of Medicine, Division of Interventional Radiology and Image Guided Medicine at 404-509-9132, 404-520-3233 or john.david.prologo@emory.edu.\nConstant Focus Review | Brain Support Supplement | Constant Focus and Memory\nConstant Focus Product Review\nYour brain is working around the clock to ensure your body carries out its necessary functions.

There is no unison agreement that these programs ensure customer loyalty however, as the literature review in this paper will show.\nOct 19, 2017 · 13 Customer Loyalty Program Ideas to Keep Customers Happy By Anna Dizon on October 19, 2017 With so many options available in physical stores and online, keeping customers loyal to your brand is no easy task.\nSUMMIT, N.J., May 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Engage Therapeutics, Inc., today announced dosing of the first patient in its multi-center, double-blind, randomized Phase 2b StATES (Seizures) trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of Staccato alprazolam in subjects with epilepsy that have a predictable seizure pattern.\nThe StATES trial (NCT03478982) will enroll 108 patients across 40 U.S.-based clinical sites. The primary endpoint is the cessation of seizure activity. Seizure episode severity, as well as the incidence of adverse events, will also be evaluated. Topline data is expected in the second half of 2019. Staccato alprazolam, a single use, investigational epileptic seizure rescue therapy, combines the Staccato delivery technology, which is currently used in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved product, with alprazolam, an FDA-approved benzodiazepine. Together, this combination is novel for an epilepsy application in a patient population in need of innovative rescue options.\nA concurrent mental illness and substance use problem means that someone experiences a mental illness and, at the same time, use substances like alcohol or other drugs in ways that could cause harm. Substance use is a problem when it negatively affects a person’s life or the lives of others. Addiction or dependence (needing to use alcohol or other drugs to stop withdrawal) is one kind of substance use problem, but you don’t need to experience an addiction to experience harm to relationships, finances, or health from alcohol or other drug use. It’s helpful to think of alcohol and drug use as a spectrum—if helpful use is at one end and harmful use is at the other end, there are varying levels of both in the middle.\nWHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP?\nPeople who experience mental illness are more likely than others to also experience a substance use problem. Similarly, people who experience problems with alcohol or drug use are more likely to be diagnosed with a mental illness. How strong is the connection? One major study that looked at people over their lifetime suggests that about half of people with one type of problem have the other type of problem, too.\nThere are three main ways that these concurrent problems interact. It’s important to keep in mind that each mental illness is different and alcohol and other drugs have different effects, so individual people will have unique experiences.\nMental illnesses can add to substance use problems\nPeople who experience mental illness might use substances like alcohol and other drugs in risky ways. One theory is that alcohol or other drugs help people cope with different symptoms of mental illnesses. For example, people who experience some anxiety disorders might use a short-term anti-anxiety medication in ways that it wasn’t prescribed, which can increase the risk of dependence. Some people may also use a substance to help manage the side effects of psychiatric medication. Researchers think this may be one of the reasons behind the high rate of smoking in people diagnosed with schizophrenia, for example.\nSubstance use problems can add to mental illnesses\nAlcohol and other drugs may add to the symptoms of mental illnesses. For example, psychosis is the group of symptoms that includes hallucinations (sensations that aren’t real) and delusions (beliefs that can’t be real). It’s found in schizophrenia and other health problems. Several drugs can cause short-term symptoms of psychosis and may lead to long-lasting symptoms in some people. For people who already experience psychosis, using alcohol and other drugs can make symptoms worse and harder to treat.\nThe same factors can increase the risk of both mental illnesses and substance use problems\nFactors like genes or changes in the brain may make some people more likely to experience both a mental illness and a substance use problem. External factors can also have an impact on mental health and substance use. Experiences of trauma, pain, poor housing, low income, loneliness, discrimination, poor access to services, easy access to substances, and other concerns that affect our community impact every individual’s health and well-being. These factors increase the risk of both mental illnesses and substance use problems.\nWHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT?\nIf you’re concerned about a concurrent mental illness and substance use problem, it’s important to ask for help. Some people are concerned that talking about using illegal drugs might have negative consequences. In most cases, anything you tell your health care provider is private. Using illegal drugs won’t stop you from being able to receive help.\nA real problem in Canada is that mental health and substance use systems are often separate. This means that many people have to receive treatment and support for their illnesses separately, or they are denied access to care for one problem because of the other problems they have. Fortunately, more service providers are now developing more integrated treatment options for concurrent problems.\nIt’s important to note that the goal of treatment for substance use problems may not be stopping all substance use. A more realistic goal for some people might be using substances in less risky or harmful ways (also known as harm reduction).\nHere are some options for treating concurrent problems:\nPsychotherapy—Psychotherapy or counselling is a common approach for both mental illnesses and substance use problems. There are many different types of psychotherapies, depending on the problems you’d like to address and your goals in treatment. Many psychotherapy and counselling approaches work on building skills so you can cope with problems or challenges in healthier ways.\nMedications—Medications may be used to treat mental illnesses, and they may be helpful in the treatment of some substance use problems. The type of medication depends on the illness or symptoms. Some medications interact with alcohol and other drugs, so it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have any concerns.\nSocial services and supports—People who experience concurrent disorders may face extra challenges in finding a healthy home, earning enough to live well, and other important aspects of living with dignity. Extra supports can help people succeed in treatment, achieve their goals, and find a supportive community.\nDO YOU NEED MORE HELP?\nContact a community organization like the Canadian Mental Health Association to learn more about support and resources in your area.

They are treating more patients who delayed care during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nUniversity of New Mexico Hospital is at 125% capacity, but only about 3% are patients with COVID-19.\n\"Now we are trying to catch up and get all of those people who delayed care, getting them the surgeries and other care that they need,\" said Dr. Steve McLaughlin, chair of UNM Hospital's Health Emergency Medicine Department.\nMcLaughlin said many patients delayed care because their doctors told them to, but he said others were worried about the risk of contracting COVID-19.\nHowever, he is seeing a change in behavior.\n\"As people are getting vaccinated, and the state is doing a wonderful job with that, people are now coming into the doctor, and coming into the hospital, with the things that they, maybe, ignored during the pandemic,\" he said.\nIn response, UNM Hospital is creating extra hospital capacity, and opening up clinic spots.\n\"Every single day, looking at really each patient in the hospital and how we can get them through the hospital as safely and quickly as possible, so we can get that next person in,\" Mclaughlin said.\nMclaughlin believes hospital capacity issues hit New Mexico harder than other states because of the rural and underserved areas.\nHowever, while hospitalizations remain an area of concern, Presbyterian and Lovelace report their systems are running below capacity.\nWestern Carolina University - Emory Prescott\nAssistant Adjunct Professor & Clinical Supervisor\nPhone: 828-227-2425\nEmail: eeprescott@wcu.edu\nOffice: CHHS, Room 163\nB.S.

I feel so much gratitude when I work with adult clients and students, because we have the chance to improve lives, to assist in human recovery & wellness, and to elevate that individual's quality of life every day. I see us as \"change agents,\" healers who impact the human condition. My Speech Pathology career has primarily focused on acute care and outpatient clinical settings, and I've also worked in long term care and private practice. I treat adult conditions such as dysphagia, apraxia, dysarthria, aphasia and voice disorders, and enjoy working closely with the area medical community.\nThe focus of my doctoral studies is on the complementary addition of botanicals to standard Speech Pathology care as it assists in positive treatment outcomes. I believe the movement toward individualized approaches to wellness is driving a revival of more natural patient care and prevention.\nI love hiking in the mountains with my dog, yoga, reading, and traveling, and I also enjoy having a nice glass of red wine while looking out over the amazing mountain view of my backyard. I am a NC native, an avid organic gardener, and I love classical music. As I continue my studies in the area of Integrative Medicine as it relates to Speech Pathology, I am reminded of the holistic process and connectivity of every living being.

(2017) Preventative Science. 18(4) 481-489\nPeer victimization is associated with several mental health and behavioral problems during childhood and adolescence. Identifying prospective associations between victimization and factors known to protect against these problems may ultimately contribute to more precise developmental models for victimization's role in behavioral and mental health.\nThis study tested prospective associations between peer victimization and dispositional mindfulness, defined by non-judgmental and accepting awareness of the constant stream of lived experience, during early adolescence.\nAs hypothesized, baseline victimization predicted significantly lower levels of mindfulness at 4-month posttest. Baseline mindfulness did not predict victimization. Results may reflect victimized youths' mindful awareness being recurrently diverted away from the present moment due to thoughts of prior and/or impending victimization. Study implications may include implementing mindful awareness practices as an intervention strategy for victimized youth to enhance and/or restore this promotive factor.\nMay 3, 2017 ~ TRFT Library & Knowledge Service\t~ Leave a comment\nThe House of Commons Education and Health Committees have jointly published Children and young people's mental health: the role of education.\nThe Committees found that financial pressures are restricting the provision of mental health services in schools and colleges. It calls on the Government to commit sufficient resource to ensure effective services are established in all parts of the country. It also calls for strong partnerships between the education sector and mental health services.\nRead the full report: Children and young people's mental health – The role of education\nSalk, R. et al. Psychological Bulletin | Published online: 27 April 2017\nIn 2 meta-analyses on gender differences in depression in nationally representative samples, we advance previous work by including studies of depression diagnoses and symptoms to\n(a) estimate the magnitude of the gender difference in depression across a wide array of nations and ages;\n(b) use a developmental perspective to elucidate patterns of gender differences across the life span; and\n(c) incorporate additional theory-driven moderators (e.g., gender equity).\nThe gender difference for diagnoses emerged earlier than previously thought, with OR = 2.37 at age 12. For both meta-analyses, the gender difference peaked in adolescence (OR = 3.02 for ages 13–15, and d = 0.47 for age 16) but then declined and remained stable in adulthood. Cross-national analyses indicated that larger gender differences were found in nations with greater gender equity, for major depression, but not depression symptoms. The gender difference in depression represents a health disparity, especially in adolescence, yet the magnitude of the difference indicates that depression in men should not be overlooked\nHausenblas, H.A. (2017) BMJ. 357:j1745\nPutting patients at the centre of their care is something that has featured in just about every annual report and health strategy document I've read in the last few years | Andre Tomlin for The Mental Elf Blog\nJust like 'evidence-based' and 'shared-decision making', it's a phrase that we read all the time, but is there any evidence that we're actually doing it? Previous research suggests not (Wolpert et al, 2015), which means we run the risk of losing patients who may rightly feel alienated, but there is evidence that including young people in the decision making around their mental health care leads to better involvement and engagement (e.g. Simmons et al, 2011).\nStudies - HICOR - Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center\nPrincipal Investigator: Scott Ramsey, M.D., Ph.D.\nBankruptcy may represent a unique and heretofore unstudied potential source of health disparity. In this study, we formed a novel partnership with the Federal Bankruptcy Court and the National Cancer Institute's SEER cancer registry to link bankruptcy records for cancer patients and a matched control population without cancer.\nOur findings indicated that cancer patients experience excess rates of bankruptcy compared to persons without cancer, results that have potentially important implications for those researching the causes of cancer disparity, and for policymakers seeking to mitigate the economic as well as clinical burden of persons with cancer.\nFunding Source: NIH Heart, Lung and Blood Institute\nA Multi-Center, Phase III, Randomized Trial of Reduced Intensity Conditioning (RIC) and Transplantation of Double Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood (dUCB) versus HLA-Haploidentical Related Bone Marrow (haplo-BM) for Patients with Hematologic Malignancies\nThe BMT CTN 1101 parent trial is a Phase III, randomized, open label, multicenter, prospective, comparative trial of double unrelated umbilical cord blood (dUCB) versus HLA-Haploidentical related bone marrow (haplo-BM) transplantation after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) in patients with hematologic malignancies. This clinical trial is being led by Dr. Paul O'Donnell at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. In conjunction with this clinical trial, Dr. Scott Ramsey is spearheading a parallel cost-effectiveness analysis substudy to determine the incremental cost per quality adjusted life years (QALYs), of double unrelated umbilical cord blood (dUCB) versus HLA-Haploidentical related bone marrow (haplo-BM).\nThe purpose of this ancillary cost-effectiveness analysis substudy is to compare patient outcomes to determine which transplantation source improves quality-adjusted survival and whether the more effective transplant type also provides a cost savings to the health care payer. BMT CTN 1101 is one of the first trials to study the total cost of transplantation by collecting out-of-pocket costs from patients and caregivers. The results of this cost-effectiveness substudy will have the potential to fundamentally change treatment decision-making for patients by maximizing health outcomes for patients and helping patients and health insurers to manage high transplantation costs.\nFunding Source: GE Healthcare via Center for Sustainable Health\nThis collaboration between GE Healthcare, Arizona State University's Center for Sustainable Health, and Fred Hutch uses multi-stakeholder engagement, and early cycle health economic evaluation to identify, prioritize and evaluate the diagnostic technologies early in the research and development process. The aim of this collaborative project is use a systems-based, stakeholder-guided approach to develop cost-effective, evidence-based diagnostics that improve human health and are well-positioned for clinical implementation.\nAdvancing Innovative Comparative Effectiveness in Cancer Diagnostics (ADVICE)\nPrincipal Investigators: Larry Kessler, Sc.D.; Scott Ramsey, M.D., Ph.D.; Sean Sullivan, Ph.D.; Diana Buist, Ph.D.\nAdvancing Innovative Comparative Effectiveness research-cancer diagnostics (ADVICE) is a collaboration between researchers at Fred Hutch (FHCRC), Group Health Research Institute (GHRI), the University of Washington (UW), and the Veterans Administration (VA) of Puget Sound.\nThe ADVICE project, performed with active involvement of local stakeholders, developed a data infrastructure for comparative effectiveness research studies that linked private and public insurance claims data with the SEER Cancer Registry. Initial analyses focused on MRI, PET/PET-CT and CT compared to mammography for women with local, regional and advanced stage breast cancer as well as the use of PET/PET-CT for staging of newly diagnosed NSCLC patients. The resulting dataset consists of more than 85% of patients in the public and private insurance market (excluding the self-insured) in Western Washington. The size and inclusiveness of this database allows for results to be generalized to other regions and nationally.\nImpact of Bevacizumab Use on Overall Survival in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients Treated in the Community\nPrincipal Investigator: Veena Shankaran, M.D., M.S.\nThis research initiative aims to understand the impact of bevacizumab use in overall survival for patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer using SEER-Medicare claims data. In collaboration with Genentech, Inc., this retrospective database study is led by Dr. Shankaran, gastrointestinal oncologist at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and clinical investigator at the Fred Hutch. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody drug marketed by Genentech, Inc. that has become an essential component of colorectal cancer therapy in the last several years. Although the use of bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been shown to improve overall survival in large clinical trials, the impact of bevacizumab on patient survival in community practices in the United States is not known.\nPrincipal Investigator: Bernardo Goulart, M.D., M.S.\nFunding Source: The Gregory Fund for Early Cancer Detection Research\nTo address the uncertainties associated with low-dose CT (LDCT) screening for lung cancer, Dr. Goulart and collaborators at the Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research (HICOR) have developed a pilot registry of patients undergoing LDCT screening at the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA). This single center pilot study conducts chart reviews and patient surveys using the EQ-5-D and SF-12 quality of life questionnaires to collect prospective data on LDCT test performance (true and false positive rates), health-related quality of life at baseline, 3, and 6 months after screening, healthcare resource utilization, medical complications, adherence to guidelines for patient selection, and smoking cessation rates. This pilot project has been critical for establishing the research infrastructure for data collection in a single academic medical center and will generate insightful preliminary data about the characteristics of the initial patients screened in practice and the clinical and economic outcomes of LDCT screening after the release of the NLST results."

The Third International NanoBio Conference will take place at ETH Zurich, August 24-27, 2010. For this 4-day conference, we will have at least 43 invited, internationally renowned speakers for plenary and two parallel sessions, as well as poster sessions and an industrial exhibition. We expect around 500 participants, 250 - 300 posters and about 15-20 exhibitors. The conference will take place in the Main Building of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich) providing ample space for sessions and exhibition, and located very close to Zurich City Center (in walking distance to conference hotels and center).\nNanobiotechnology is the discipline of the future that is taking over the role of being the motor of economic growth from information technology. Biology is inherently nano. Just think of a cell, which is a warehouse of structures and functional units that are finely harmonized on the nanometer scale. The new tools of nanotechnology allow us to address biological and medical problems with unprecedented accuracy and sensitivity because now it has become possible to interact with the bio-world at the length scale at which it operates. New intelligent drug delivery vehicles, novel nanobiosensors, nanomedical imaging tools and other nanobio-devices, and new nanostructured biomaterials are expected to speed up quantitative biological and medical research, boost our diagnostic capabilities, and increase the length and quality of our lives. At the same time nanostructures inspired by nature or created using biological processes are expected to reduce the production costs of new nanodevices making them accessible for the public.\nSuch unique possibilities also come along with large, often unrealistic expectations and fears in the society. This meeting gathers the leaders of this progressive field from all over the world helping scientists to get an update on the most recent achievements in the different topics of nanobiotechnology, to discuss, to network, to exchange stimulating new ideas, and to take responsibility in forming public opinion about nanobiotechnology.\nAny data that you submit using this web form will be held by our firm as Data Controller and will be held securely for 6 months before being securely and confidentially destroyed.

Hormones travel the blood stream sending messages to organs and tissues that tell the body how to operate.\nHormone imbalances can occur due to a variety of factors such as:\nPeople who suffer from hormonal imbalances can experience a wide range of symptoms from minor fatigue to fibromyalgia. A common misconception is that hormonal fluctuations occur only during menopause. Hormonal imbalances can occur to women at any age and should be checked by a health care provider.\nFatigue can be caused by the adrenal gland not releasing enough hormones such as epinephrine. People who suffer from constant fatigue should be checked for hormonal imbalance by their physician.\nSome women experience acne as a result of increasing testosterone that causes the body to produce extra oil. All women have testosterone in their body about 1/10 the amount of adult males. Many women report breakouts about a week before their period. It is not completely known why this occurs but is apparent that changes in hormone levels play a role.\nIncreased hormones in the body such as cortisol contribute to a variety of health problems including weight gain. Cortisol is known as the \"stress hormone\" because it is released by the body during times of stress. It has positive effects on the body such as heightened senses, increased energy, and a lower sensitivity to pain.\nPeople who are exposed to high stress levels get too much cortisol in their bloodstream which results in insulin resistance and slower metabolism making it difficult to lose weight.\nWhen endocrine glands such as the thyroid stop working properly they can cause hormonal imbalances that lead to depression. It is not fully understood why thyroid malfunction causes depression but has been linked in several medical studies. Doctors can perform a series of blood tests to determine if the thyroid is not working properly.\nHormones such as estrogen and testosterone can be thrown off by birth control pills, smoking, drinking, poor diet and lack of exercise. Low levels of testosterone are a main cause for a decrease in sexual desire or a low libido.\nSPORT CAFE is the perfect setting to enjoy the best sporting events in the world on a giant screen.

The inevitable health problems can include heart problems, organ damage, stomach problems, brain damage, cancer, reproductive problems, liver cirrhosis, memory problems and mental health problems.\nAlcohol Dependency, abuse, or addiction affects not just the person doing the drinking. Beloved family members and everyone else close to the alcoholic inevitably gets dragged into the walking disaster as well. Partners and children of the problem drinker are more likely to suffer psychological problems, physical abuse, violence, neglect and increased risk of injury or death in alcohol related accidents and assaults.\nWhat Is Stem Cell Knee Treatment Like? | Info Dir Web\nWhat Is Stem Cell Knee Treatment Like?\nadmin October, 2017 Medical Center No Comments\nYou struggle to stand and move. You deal with managing pain medication most of the day. Even worse, you find yourself unable to enjoy a high quality of life. You don't want surgery. Instead, you think you have to just deal with it. You don't. Stem cell knee treatment is an option, and it can prove to be one of the most effective ways for you to overcome the pain you feel without all of the complications of other treatments. Take a look at how easy this treatment can be.\nStem cell knee treatment starts with an assessment to determine the underlying cause of your injury. From there, doctors will work to determine the proper type of stem cell treatment including where to inject them. Once the injection occurs, the stem cells go to work. They reduce the inflammation there, reproduce healthy cells, and help to reprogram your body's healing system to overcome the disability. Many people begin to see healthy improvement within a few weeks, but maximum results take about 12 weeks.\nIt is likely that patients who use this treatment will see an improvement to the way their body works.

Crandall, M.D., works to prevent diabetes and its complications.\nThe DPP followed patients at risk for diabetes for an average of only three years and so couldn't answer some key questions, such as: Can people ward off diabetes indefinitely if they stick with their medications and a healthy lifestyle? Will at-risk people who change their behaviors but still develop diabetes experience less frequent or less severe complications? Such questions are being addressed in the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study, or DPPOS, which is following the original DPP participants for an additional 15 years.\n\"The average age of our study participants is now in the mid-60s, so this phase should show whether people can maintain an active lifestyle with advancing age,\" says Jill P. Crandall, M.D., professor of clinical medicine (endocrinology), a DPP investigator and now one of the DPPOS's principal investigators. \"Perhaps most important, we'll find out whether the DPP interventions help reduce diabetic complications.\"\n\"Perhaps most important, we'll find out whether the DPP interventions help reduce diabetic complications.\"\nThe findings from the current phase of DPPOS are expected in 2015. \"We assume and hope that the program will produce long-term benefits, but we don't know for sure,\" says Dr. Crandall, who is also an attending physician in endocrinology at Montefiore Medical Center.\nAs your weight (expressed here as body mass index, or BMI) rises, so does your risk of developing type 2 diabetes. This illustration, based on the landmark Nurses' Health Study, shows that even a woman of average weight (BMI = 24) has about a five-fold higher risk of developing diabetes than a woman with a BMI of 22 or less. Other studies show a similar risk for men and for adolescents of both sexes. (Visit http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/ to learn your BMI.)\nElizabeth A. Walker, Ph.D., R.N., is searching for ways to translate study findings into workable remedies.\nThe DPP finally gave clinicians a highly effective remedy for preventing diabetes or slowing its onset. The next and arguably more formidable challenge is motivating patients to take the \"medicine\" prescribed by the DPP—no easy task. Studies assessing patient compliance have found that as few as 60 percent of type 2 diabetes patients adhere to the medication regimen prescribed for them.\nAs few as 60 percent of type 2 diabetes patients adhere to their medication regimen\nPatients are even less likely to follow healthy eating and exercise recommendations than to do something relatively simple such as taking a pill, notes Elizabeth A. Walker, Ph.D., R.N., professor of medicine (endocrinology) and of epidemiology & population health and co-leader of the DPP's medication adherence group.\n\"Eating in particular is highly complex,\" Dr. Walker notes. \"It's fraught with emotions. It's about comfort food, family, memories of Mom's home cooking. Plus, you have to decide what to eat several times a day. The challenge of eating well is never ending.\"\nDr. Crandall says that the realities of everyday life can also interfere with healthful habits. \"For example,\" she asks, \"how do you inspire adults to exercise when they are working two jobs and must take two buses to get to the local YMCA? How do you encourage children to eat fresh fruits and vegetables when fast foods are available on every corner?\"\nThe task of translating the DPP findings into workable remedies falls to behavioral scientists such as Dr. Walker. Below are descriptions of her work and that of other like-minded faculty at Einstein and its primary teaching hospital, Montefiore Medical Center.\nA few years after the DPP issued its findings, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention teamed with the YMCA to bring the DPP's lifestyle intervention to communities nationwide. Now known as the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP), this yearlong effort consists of 16 weekly group sessions on diet and exercise, followed by periodic \"booster\" classes. The NDPP is now offered in some 250 locations in 26 states.\nThe NDPP reportedly is working well, yet it can't begin to reach all those who need it. This is especially true in the Bronx, with its single YMCA site for a population of 1.4 million and a high incidence of obesity.\nThe clear need for more resources prompted Dr. Walker to apply for and win a grant from the Leon Lowenstein Foundation, Inc., of New York to study whether modifying the Bronx NDPP could pave the way for more such programs in the borough.\nOne of the most compelling findings to arise from her study was that men make up just one in ten Bronx NDPP enrollees. \"This is a significant problem,\" says Dr. Walker. \"Men have a somewhat higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes than women, and black and Latino men have a higher risk than Caucasian men.\"\nIt's too early for a definitive explanation for the gender disparity found in the Bronx NDPP classes, but Dr. Walker suspects a major reason is that the men simply aren't as interested as women in \"lifestyle\" programs. \"If that's true,\" she says, \"we think that we can get more men in the door by emphasizing physical activity and making the group activities a bit more competitive.\"\nDr. Walker and her colleagues (who include officials at the Bronx NDPP and healthcare providers and administrators at Montefiore) are also looking at ways to improve overall enrollment, increase retention rates, lower economic barriers to participation and find additional sites for hosting the program. Montefiore has now begun offering the NDPP program at some of its own clinics, including classes taught in Spanish. And the medical center has updated its electronic medical record system, allowing clinicians to refer patients to a diabetes prevention program more easily.\n\"At Montefiore we've made diabetes prevention a top priority,\" says Peter A. Selwyn, M.D., M.P.H., professor and chair of family and social medicine at Einstein and Montefiore, professor of epidemiology & population health, of medicine and of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Einstein and director of the Office of Community Health and Wellness at Montefiore. \"We're working to find new ways of promoting healthy behaviors and healthy environments. In public health, we often talk about making the healthy choice the easy choice. That tactic is critical in preventing diabetes.\"\nA borough away from the Bronx but a world apart, other Einstein researchers are studying diabetes prevention among Chinese immigrants in Lower Manhattan—another community that could benefit from a customized approach to diabetes prevention.\nJudith Wylie-Rosett, Ed.D., is fine-tuning research results for use by ethnic groups such as New York's Chinese-American community.\n\"The NDPP is a good idea—it brings people to a place to both learn and exercise—but it's not ideal for this particular community,\" explains Judith Wylie-Rosett, Ed.D., professor of epidemiology & population health (health promotion and nutrition research) and of medicine (endocrinology) and the Atran Foundation Chair in Social Medicine. \"Chinese immigrants prefer getting their healthcare advice from Chinese physicians. So if you want to reach this population, you have to go through the local practices rather than the YMCA.\"\nDr. Wylie-Rosett gained her insights from working with several organizations serving New York City's Chinese-American community. That collaboration has yielded recommendations for tailoring the NDPP intervention to this group. \"We've learned, for example, that many Chinese aren't comfortable talking about personal issues in a group setting, so we've added telephone counseling for certain topics,\" she says.\nOther adaptations include adding karaoke—a favorite Asian pastime—to the stress-management session; distributing healthy Chinese recipes; and tailoring discussions on how body fat relates to diabetes (reflecting that Asians tend to develop the disease at a lower body mass index [or BMI, an indicator of body fat] than other groups do).\nDr. Wylie-Rosett and her colleagues are currently finishing a pilot study to test whether the revamped program is acceptable and effective.\nJust a mile from the Einstein campus, the Bronx Bangladeshi community is the fastest-growing immigrant group in New York City. Until recently, its health needs were largely unknown. A 2012 survey by Alison Karasz, Ph.D., associate professor of family and social medicine, found that an astonishing 74 percent of local Bangladeshi women were either overweight or obese and that more than 15 percent had type 2 diabetes—the highest rates in the city.\nOffering these women a program such as the NDPP lifestyle intervention might have seemed a logical response. But Dr. Karasz, a clinical psychologist who has been practicing in the Bronx South Asian community for years, had a different idea.\n74 percent of local Bangladeshi women were either overweight or obese and more than 15 percent had type 2 diabetes—the highest rates in New York city\n\"Intensive lifestyle programs such as the NDPP are highly effective in the general population,\" she says. \"But they're based on Western theories of 'empowering the individual' that tend to ignore the extent to which learning and behavior change are embedded in social networks and communities.\" When recruiting women from such a traditional hierarchical society into treatment, she adds, \"it's important to make sure that their families are on board with the program.\"\nSuch considerations prompted Dr. Karasz and her colleagues to develop two lifestyle interventions aimed at improving women's nutrition and exercise habits: SAATHI (South Asians Acting Together for Health Improvement) and APPLE (Activating People to Pursue Lifestyle Change through Empowerment). Both programs build social networks that offer support for women as they change their behaviors in ways acceptable to family members. For example, each participant is partnered with a bondhu (\"friend\" in Bengali) who helps her set goals and maintain her lifestyle changes.\nThe approximately 50 women recruited so far into SAATHI and APPLE lost an average of 5.8 percent of their weight after completing the programs. And, says Dr. Karasz, about 75 percent of enrollees complete the programs—a much better retention rate than other lifestyle programs designed for immigrants have achieved. She believes these programs could serve as a model for diabetes prevention and treatment programs in other traditional immigrant communities.\nReaders of a certain age may remember when type 2 diabetes was called \"adult-onset\" diabetes, since it didn't usually appear until middle age. But diabetes has been trending younger and younger in recent years—a direct consequence of the rise in childhood obesity. Einstein and Montefiore have launched several initiatives to help children avoid the disease. One example is B'N Fit (the Bronx Nutrition and Fitness Initiative for Teens), founded and directed by Jessica Rieder, M.D., M.S., associate clinical professor of pediatrics (adolescent medicine) at Einstein and an attending physician in adolescent medicine at The Children's Hospital at Montefiore.\nB'N Fit is a nine-month weight-management program that helps obese inner-city adolescents adopt healthy lifelong nutritional and physical activity skills; develop coping skills and personal responsibility; and use family, social and community resources to achieve personal goals. Begun in 2005, B'N Fit is a collaborative effort of The Children's Hospital at Montefiore and the Mosholu Montefiore Community Center.\nDr. Rieder and her colleagues recently evaluated 349 adolescents (two-thirds of them severely obese) who enrolled in B'N Fit. The 91 participants who completed the program showed significant improvement in their BMIs, consumed significantly more servings of fruit and vegetables daily and participated significantly more often in vigorous physical activities—all in spite of school obligations, family emergencies and transportation issues. But nine months after the teens completed the program, their BMIs had increased significantly.\nThe participants showed significant improvement in their body mass index (BMI) and ate significantly more fruits and vegetables daily\n\"Our findings indicate that a nine-month program isn't long enough to have a sustained impact on obese inner-city teens,\" says Dr. Rieder. \"These kids need long-term support for sticking with the healthy lifestyles that are so crucial for losing weight and keeping it off.\"\nDr. Wylie-Rosett is developing a program similar to B'N Fit for preteens at risk for diabetes, but adding parents to the mix. \"Our goal is to make a healthy lifestyle a family agenda,\" she says. The program features recreational and educational activities for kids plus workshops for parents that include advice on healthy eating and effective parenting strategies.\nIdeally, the program will change the family dynamic when it comes to eating—making the dinner table the focal point of meals, for example. \"In many households, the TV is on all the time, and everyone eats in front it,\" says Dr. Wylie-Rosett. \"There's no regular meal time. We think it's important for family members to eat together, to talk to each other and to pay attention to what they're eating.\"\nDr. Wylie-Rosett is planning to test the intervention on several hundred Bronx families.\nIf lifestyles changes aren't enough to prevent diabetes, perhaps a glass of red wine can do the trick.\nAs many oenophiles know, red grapes contain a chemical called resveratrol that can normalize glucose metabolism, prevent cancer and heart disease and prolong life spans—at least in animals. In a 2010 pilot study of 10 older patients with prediabetes, Dr. Crandall and her Einstein colleagues found that resveratrol supplements improved the subjects' insulin sensitivity and postmeal glucose tolerance—the first study to link resveratrol to a benefit in humans.\nDr. Crandall was later awarded a $600,000 grant from the American Diabetes Association to expand her inquiry into resveratrol. She will study 30 people ages 50 to 80 who have impaired glucose tolerance to see how resveratrol supplements affect postmeal metabolism of blood glucose. Preliminary studies will explore how resveratrol works by examining cellular function (in muscle samples obtained from study participants) and by testing resveratrol's effect on blood vessel function.\nResveratrol supplements must be used because diet alone can't supply what is believed to be a therapeutic concentration of the compound: Researchers estimate that you'd need to drink hundreds bottles of wine per day to obtain the resveratrol levels found therapeutic in mice.\n\"Our earlier work has given us reason to be hopeful,\" says Dr. Crandall. \"Given the easy availability, low cost and apparent safety of resveratrol supplements, a positive finding could have an enormous impact on human health.\"\n\"We need a national public health campaign aimed at diabetes prevention, similar to those used to curb smoking or mandating seatbelt use.\"\nEven if resveratrol proves useful in preventing diabetes, much more must be done to put a dent in the diabetes epidemic.\n\"All the things that drive the epidemic are societal—the limited availability of healthy foods in many neighborhoods, the relentless junk-food advertising aimed at children, the lack of recreational opportunities in urban areas,\" says Dr. Crandall. \"We need a major national public health campaign aimed at diabetes prevention, similar to campaigns used to curb smoking or mandating seatbelt use.\"\nThat effort, she says, may involve requiring people to change their behavior, not just suggesting they do so. \"We banned smoking from public spaces, making it harder to light up,\" she notes. \"The bottom line is that people are much safer.\n\"It's an enormous challenge,\" Dr. Crandall acknowledges, \"but the potential benefits are huge. If we can prevent diabetes, we would also reduce the incidence of heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, and many other complications.\" Ben Franklin would certainly have approved.\nPeople at risk for type 2 diabetes can prevent or slow the onset of the disease through diet, exercise or drugs. But the search continues for a way to stave off type 1 diabetes, which affects about 5 percent of all people who have the disease.\nScientists led by Teresa P. DiLorenzo, Ph.D., professor of microbiology & immunology and of medicine (endocrinology) and the Diane Belfer, Cypres & Endelson Families Faculty Scholar in Diabetes Research at Einstein, believe the answer may lie with immune-system cells called dendritic cells. They patrol the body looking for foreign invaders such as bacteria, viruses or toxins.\n[hdvideo id=21 playlistid=6]\nAfter capturing the invaders, dendritic cells break them into fragments and present them to T cells—thereby priming T cells to attack anything in the body that displays those fragments. Type 1 diabetes occurs when T cells mistakenly view the pancreas's beta cells (the body's source of insulin) as potential threats and then launch an autoimmune attack that destroys them.\"Suppressing all of the body's T cells could prevent or even reverse type 1 diabetes,\" says Dr. DiLorenzo. \"However, this would lead to serious side effects, such as an increased susceptibility to infections and cancer. Our approach seeks to suppress only those T cells responsible for destroying the beta cells.\"\nHere's where dendritic cells come in. New research has revealed that dendritic cells can influence T cells in two diametrically opposite ways: provoking T cell attacks in some circumstances and suppressing attacks in others. Dr. DiLorenzo is trying to bolster the suppressive side of dendritic cells—essentially enlisting them to \"teach\" T cells not to attack beta cells of the pancreas.\nType 1 diabetes occurs when T cells mistakenly view the pancreas's beta cells—the body's source of insulin—as potential threats and then launch an autoimmune attack\nThe autoimmune attack on beta cells targets specific antigens, including a peptide (small protein) within proinsulin, the precursor to insulin. In studies of diabetic mice, Dr. DiLorenzo and her colleagues deliver this antigen to a dendritic cell-surface receptor called DEC-205. After the dendritic cells ingest the antigen, they present it to T cells.\nWhen the antigen was later introduced into the mice, no immune response occurred—evidence that T cells of the mouse immune system now tolerate this peptide. If the same strategy works in humans, says Dr. DiLorenzo, it might be possible to protect people at high risk for type 1 diabetes from developing the disease.\nEinstein researchers are also participating in a study called Pathway to Prevention, which recruits people at increased risk for type 1 diabetes to learn more about how it develops. Study subjects are selected by screening the blood relatives of those with type 1 diabetes and testing them for antibodies associated with the disease.\nPeople with those so-called autoantibodies have a 10- to 15-fold greater risk of developing type 1 diabetes compared with people with no family history, says Rubina A. Heptulla, M.B.B.S., professor of pediatrics (endocrinology) and of medicine at Einstein and chief of pediatric endocrinology and diabetes at The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, one of the screening sites. Pathway to Prevention is part of TrialNet, an international network of researchers and institutions dedicated to the study, prevention and early treatment of type 1 diabetes.\nFour years ago, it was a vacant lot. Today the Bronx, Obesity, Diabetes and You (BODY for short) garden features six raised vegetable beds, fruit bushes, a lettuce table, a gravel path, flower beds, picnic tables, compost bins and herb plantings. Students in Einstein's BODY club are using this space just south of Montefiore's Weiler Hospital to introduce Bronx residents to the joys of planting, harvesting and (most important) eating healthy food and making exercise a daily routine—two big ways to prevent or control type 2 diabetes.Last May, BODY garden volunteers hosted their first school group: 150 fourth graders from P.S. 89.\n\"When I started BODY, I thought I'd have to pull teeth to get busy Einstein students involved, but the reality was the opposite—my peers led and participated in many BODY activities over the last three years,\" says Ross Kristal, Class of 2015, who has type 1 diabetes. \"They brought a steady stream of creative ideas to the table, and the Einstein faculty and administration helped us implement them.\"\nRoss is now digging into population health research focusing on diabetes and obesity and has passed his BODY trowel to graduate students Tony Bowen and Julie Nadel.\nMore than 40 years ago, research conducted at Einstein helped connect a type of hemoglobin called HbA1c to diabetes—a discovery that has transformed the way diabetes is diagnosed, treated and prevented.\nThe story begins in 1968 when Samuel Rahbar, M.D., Ph.D., a Jewish-Iranian scientist, was examining blood samples in his lab at the University of Tehran. Nearly 20 years earlier, Linus Pauling had found that an aberrant type of hemoglobin was responsible for sickle cell anemia. Dr. Rahbar was looking for other hemoglobin variants that might be linked to human disease. After screening thousands of blood samples, he saw something interesting in the blood of a 67-year-old woman.\n\"I said to myself, 'What is this? This isn't fitting with any of the known hemoglobins,'\" Dr. Rahbar recalled years later in an interview. The woman's medical records indicated that she had diabetes—prompting Dr. Rahbar to examine the blood of 47 more people with diabetes, all of whom had the same unusual type of hemoglobin. He published his findings later that year in a paper, \"An Abnormal Hemoglobin in Red Cells of Diabetics.\"\nHelen M. Ranney, M.D., in 1961.\nDr. Rahbar was eager to confirm his findings in a different laboratory, so later that year, he came to Einstein as a visiting scientist working under Helen M. Ranney, M.D., a professor of medicine and pioneer in studying hemoglobin and sickle cell anemia.Drs. Rahbar and Ranney analyzed blood samples from people in the neighborhoods around Einstein and found the same unusual hemoglobin in 140 diabetic patients. In describing their findings in 1969 in Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications, the researchers noted that their novel \"diabetic component\" appeared identical to HbA1c—one of five recently identified hemoglobin subtypes.\nDrs. Rahbar and Ranney analyzed blood samples from people in the neighborhoods around Einstein and found the same unusual hemoglobin in 140 diabetic patients\nUniquely, HbA1c involved a specific fraction of hemoglobin that had been \"glycated,\" or chemically combined with glucose. And the higher a person's blood glucose level, the larger the percentage of total hemoglobin that was converted to HbA1c. Drs. Rahbar and Ranney reported that HbA1c made up 4 to 6 percent of normal subjects' total hemoglobin compared with 7.5 to 10.6 percent of the total hemoglobin of diabetic patients.\nIn the late 1970s, investigators in Einstein's new Diabetes Research and Training Center were among the first to put HbA1c to practical use: they tested HbA1c levels of Bronx diabetes patients enrolled in long-term studies as a way to monitor patients' blood glucose control. But not until 1984 did the test get its big break, with the launch of the landmark Diabetes Control and Complications Trial.\nThe DCCT—a nationwide study funded by the National Institutes of Health—compared different treatments for type 1 diabetes head to head. It used the HbA1c test to assess each treatment's effectiveness in controlling blood sugar levels over the\nIn 1993, the DCCT reported that intensive blood sugar control, as measured by HbA1c level, dramatically reduced the long-term complications of type 1 diabetes. (Einstein's role in the DCCT is described in \"\".)\nThe HbA1c test soon became a game changer. Glucose tests such as finger-prick testing report blood glucose levels at a particular moment, which helps patients adjust daily insulin doses. But such tests offer no information about the long-term blood glucose levels that so crucially influence whether com-plications will develop in someone with diabetes.\nBy contrast, the HbA1c test measures a patient's average blood glucose level over the previous two or three months (the lifespan of a red blood cell). Clinicians now routinely test their diabetes patients' HbA1c levels several times a year. They adjust patients' therapies accordingly, to optimize blood glucose control and minimize the risk of life-threatening complications.\nThe HbA1c test has now been validated for diagnosing types 1 and 2 diabetes and for monitoring prediabetic patients to prevent full-blown diabetes from developing. (The American Diabetes Association now regards a diabetes diagnosis as being warranted when someone's HbA1c level is greater than or equal to 6.5 percent.) In addition, measuring HbA1c has become the FDA's gold standard for evaluating the effectiveness of new diabetes treatments. It's no surprise that HbA1c was recently called \"one of the most important biological molecules in modern medicine.\"\nDr. Rahbar returned to Iran after his stint at Einstein. During the Iranian revolution he was accused of being cozy with the Shah's family, lost his professorship at the University of Tehran and fled to the United States in 1979 with his wife and three daughters. He reunited with Dr. Ranney, who by then was at the University of California–San Diego, and studied diabetes for the next 33 years at the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, CA.\nIn June 2012 the American Diabetes Association bestowed a special, one-time National Scientific Achievement Award—the Samuel Rahbar Outstanding Discovery Award—on Dr. Rahbar himself, to honor him for his discovery of HbA1c as a marker for diabetes. He died the following November at age 83.\nType 1 Diabetes: Research, Treatment and Prevention\n2 thoughts on \"Attacking an Epidemic: Type 2 Diabetes\"\nDavid Pouldar says:\nAlthough the BMI index can be useful, it does have its limitations……but in general, targeting your weight to fit the appropriate BMI index goals should be everyone's focus."
