        "description": "\"Pecaform\" is a mark used in reference to a building product, consisting of steel arc mesh covered in shrink wrap plastic, which is used to reinforce concrete in the construction of concrete structures.\nIn these reasons, such products so marked are referred to as Pecaform products.\nI am presently concerned with an application for interlocutory injunctive relief.\nDanley Construction Products Pty Ltd (Danley) seeks, in its application, interlocutory injunctions: An order pursuant to section 80 of the [ Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TPA)], pending final determination of these proceedings or further earlier order, restraining the Respondents by themselves or their directors or officers, employees, servants, agents or otherwise howsoever from contravening section 52 of the TPA by the publication of misleading and deceptive documents and representations, such representations being to the effect that the Applicant is not able and/or entitled to sell in Australia and New Zealand products under the name \"Pecaform\" and/or that the Applicant is not able to sell or supply to the market in Australia or New Zealand products that the Applicant has been selling and supplying to the market in Australia and New Zealand under the name \"Pecaform\".\nAn order pending the trial of these proceedings or further earlier order restraining the Respondents by themselves, their directors, officers, employees, servants, agents or otherwise from manufacturing, distributing, promoting, offering for sale or selling in Australia or causing or permitting (directly or indirectly) to be manufactured, distributed, promoted, offered for sale or sold in Australia the Infringing Products.\nAn order pending the trial of these proceedings or further earlier order, restraining the Respondents by themselves, their directors, or officers, employees, servants, agents or otherwise from making threats of trade mark infringement by any means including, but not limited to, verbal statements, letters, e-mails or otherwise to the Applicant or any other person.\nIt is to be noted that the representations sought to be enjoined in the first order are expressed to be cumulative or alternative, by the double use of \"and/or\".\n\"Infringing Products\", referred to in the second order sought, is defined in the application as \"building materials used in concrete construction within Australia which bear the sign Pecaform ... \" The controversy has to be seen in the commercial context of sales by the respondents in many overseas countries of Pecaform products; the importation of Pecaform products by the applicant from a Malaysian Company, ICT Pecaform (ICT), (which the respondents say is a breach by ICT of its contractual arrangements with the respondents); sales over the last ten years in Australia by Danley of Pecaform products; the registration of the Trade Mark \"Pecaform\" by the second respondent in July 2007, and the intention of the respondents to sell Pecaform products directly to the Australian market.\nThe history of the Trade Mark \"Pecaform\" and its use in Australia, as well as the sequence of facts leading to the second respondent's application for registration of the Trade Mark, informs the principal part of the dispute between the parties.\nThe commercial response of the parties to that registration is relevant to the grant of interlocutory relief.\nFor reasons which follow, I have concluded that interlocutory relief should not be granted.\n There is no dispute between the parties as to the relevant principles to be applied on the application for interlocutory relief.\nThe principal authority is the decision of the High Court in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v O'Neill [2006] HCA 46 ; (2006) 227 CLR 57 ( O'Neill ).\n The relevant principles in Australia are those explained in Beecham Group Ltd v Bristol Laboratories Pty Ltd [1968] HCA 1 ; [(1968) 118 CLR 618].\n\"The first is whether the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the plaintiff will be held entitled to relief ...\nThe second inquiry is ... whether the inconvenience or injury which the plaintiff would be likely to suffer if an injunction were refused outweighs or is outweighed by the injury which the defendant would suffer if an injunction were granted.\n By using the phrase \"prima facie case\", their Honours did not mean that the plaintiff must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the plaintiff will succeed; it is sufficient that the plaintiff show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify in the circumstances the preservation of the status quo pending the trial.\n The respondents also referred the Court to comments made by Stone J (prior to the High Court's decision above) in Hexal Australia Pty Ltd v Roche Therapeutics Inc (2005) 66 IPR 325.\n This court has power to grant interlocutory relief pursuant s 23 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth).\nThe relevant principles governing the exercise of the court's discretion to grant interlocutory relief are well established.\n (1) that there is a serious question to be tried or a prima facie case such that if the evidence remains the same there is a probability that at a final hearing it would be entitled to relief;\n (2) that it will suffer irreparable harm for which damages will not be adequate compensation, unless an injunction is granted; and\n (3) that the balance of convenience favours the granting of an injunction.\n The second and third points referred to by Stone J are interrelated.\nWhere damages can be adequate compensation, the balance of convenience will almost certainly be in favour of not granting relief; where, in the absence of an injunction, the harm will be irreparable, then the balance of convenience almost certainly favours the grant of interlocutory relief.\n Both of the respondents are related companies within the \"Max Frank Group\".\nThe first respondent, Max Frank Pte Ltd, is the majority shareholder of the second respondent, Peca Verbundtechnik GmbH, which was established in Germany in 1981.\nThe second respondent, in 1982, registered the marks \"Pecaform\" and \"Peca\" in Germany.\nMr Christopher Baron, a director of the first respondent, deposes that the mark \"Pecaform\" was registered as a Trade Mark in various European countries in the mid to late 1980s and early 1990s.\nThe steel mesh construction product that was labelled \"Pecaform\" has also been marketed and sold under the Trade Mark \"Pecafil\" in various countries.\nAlthough Pecaform and Pecafil are marked differently, they are in fact identical products.\nOn 10 August 1989, the second respondent sold a product labelled \"Pecafil\" to a company Smorgon in Australia.\nThis sale pre-dated the registration on 11 June 1991 of the mark \"Pecaform\" in Germany.\nMr Daniel Underwood, a director of the applicant, deposes that in early 1990 he saw the Pecafil product at Smorgon in Australia, and in 1993 he saw the Pecafil product in Germany.\nOn 12 October 1995, a licence agreement was executed between the second respondent and Coldform, a Malaysian company which later became ICT Pecaform (ICT), concerning a Pecafil machine and material.\nThe applicant has been carrying on the business of the manufacture, procurement and sale to the construction industry of products associated with construction, particularly concrete construction, since about 1989.\nThe annual turnover of the applicant, dated 30 June 2007 was approximately $16,000,000, and to the six months ending 31 January 2008, exceeded $11,000,000.\nMr Underwood deposes that the capital value of the applicant's business exceeds $6.5 million.\nUp until approximately the end of 1997, the applicant was not involved in any Pecaform products.\nAt a trade show in Singapore in March 1997, Mr Underwood, of the applicant, was shown by a Mr Joseph Chong of the Malaysian company ICT samples of the Pecaform product.\nDuring 1997, Mr Underwood had negotiations with Mr Chong and in the latter part of 1997 or in 1998, the applicants first purchased Pecaform products from ICT and imported them into Australia.\nMr Underwood says that, at that time, Danley caused its trade mark attorneys to conduct inquiries and searches, which did not reveal any Trade Marks in the name Pecaform registered in Australia.\nMr Underwood says that he was not aware of any previous use of the mark \"Pecaform\" in Australia, and had not heard of the Trade Mark before his discussions with Mr Chong.\nFrom at least early 1998, Danley has promoted, marketed and sold in Australia products under the name \"Pecaform\".\nAdvertising and promotional materials have included brochures and pamphlets, the inclusion of Pecaform products in the applicant's product lists and product summary brochures, advertising in trade magazines and trade publications in the building and construction industry, exhibiting and displaying of Pecaform products at various trade shows in Australia, and the advertising and promotion of Pecaform products on the applicant's website.\nThe sales figures of Pecaform products by Danley for the financial years from 2003 and the six months to 31 January 2008 are as follows: 2002 --- 2003 $404,465.04 2003 --- 2004 $346,082.00 2004 --- 2005 $862,484.82 2005-2006 $432,149.69 2006-2007 $467,074.60 Six months to 31 Jan 2008 $467,334.77 Interrupting the historical narrative of events, I note of the above table that in the submissions by the applicant for interlocutory relief these figures are said to be \"sales figures of Pecaform products for financial years from 2002-2003 to date\".\nThat description illustrates a lack of candour in the applicant's case for interlocutory relief because the internal sales figures exhibited to the affidavit of Mr Danny Underwood, one of the three directors of Danley, show the amount of those sales to the precise cent for 2002--- 2003 to be in respect of Pecaform products; similarly for 2003-2004 for Pecaform products.\nHowever, for the 2004-2005 year, while the figure is precisely the same, $862,484.82, and while the category is said to be Pecaform, the component parts do not, as they did previously, refer to Pecaform labelled products.\nThe same position applies in relation to the exhibited sales figures for the period 2005-2006 and for 2006-2007.\nFor the six months to 31 January 2008, the internal sales documents refer to component sales of Footi-Form products only, totalling $464,334.77, which is not identical with, but very similar to the tabular figure of $467,334.77.\n The documents are mute witnesses and they stand unchallenged, they are sales of Footi-Form for the last three years, roughly two or three years.\n \"Footi-Form\" is a Trade Mark registered by Danley on 3 October 2007.\nI find that Danley has \"re-badged\" what was Pecaform product as Footi-Form, as is apparent from the current product summary.\nThe applicant's case as presented appeared to me to be predicated on a continued use by Danley of Pecaform in relation to its relevant products and an intention vigorously to justify the legitimacy of that use.\n Annexed hereto and marked \" DCU-2 \" is a true copy of the Applicant's current Product Summary brochure that illustrates the type of products that the Applicant supplies and which, in numerous instances, are products that the Applicant has developed or assisted in developing.\n DCU-2 is a product summary for 2006-07.\n An inventive alternative to conventional formwork.\n Pecaform is sacrificial --- just set and forget Flat sheet wire mesh with a heat-shrunk layer of polyethylene applied to both sides Strong, lightweight and durable Can be site fabricated as required Can be pre-formed prior to delivery Easy installation, even by unskilled labour Backfill after installation and pour concrete Does not require stripping Enhances site safety\n However, if one downloads from the Danley website the product summary for 2008/2009, under the heading, \"Footi-Form &#8482;\" the same photograph with the same heading, \"An inventive alternative to conventional formwork\" appears, and the same bullet-point summary, with Pecaform replaced by Footi-Form.\nThere is no reference to \"Pecaform\" in Danley's current product summary.\n Danley has also recently adopted the name \"Footi-Form\" for this product when used to create disposable form work for concrete footings.\nThe reason for this was twofold --- firstly, the name \"Footi-form\" is a better description of its application when used to create disposable form work for concrete footings; secondly, it was decided that, as a result of the Respondents' threats and not knowing whether an injunction would be granted to restrain the Respondents' conduct, an alternative name to Pecaform should be used in addition to Pecaform.\nThis was considered to be a pragmatic business decision, but the Applicant persists with its insistence that it owns the trade mark Pecaform in Australia, having used and promoted it extensively in Australia over the last 10 years.\n The evidence as to when any threats by the respondents concerning Pecaform occurred dates that communication in February 2008, which falsifies the statement by Mr Underwood that the adoption of the name \"Footi-Form\" \"recently\", was \"as a result of the respondents' threats\".\nIn fact, Danley applied for the registration of the Trade Mark \"Footi-Form\" in July 2007, and the internal sales documents for Danley record as Footi-Form sales, sales of Pecaform product, from July 2005 to the end of January 2008.\nThe thrust of the submission by Mr Gray for the respondents is that if the evidence shows that Danley is not using \"Pecaform\" in the marketplace, it is difficult to see how there can be any possible damage to Danley's market for Pecaform by the use of the mark \"Pecaform\" by the second respondent, the registered owner of the Trade Mark \"Pecaform\" in Australia.\nReturning to the historical record of events, Mr Christopher Baron, the Regional Director Asia-Pacific of Max Frank GmbH &amp; Co KG (Max Frank) deposes that on 29 March 2006, he attended a meeting at Danley's offices in Brisbane with Mr David Wilson, the Business Development Director of Max Frank.\nThe meeting was with Mr Underwood and others, and this was the first contact between the Max Frank group of companies and Danley.\nMr Underwood admitted a relationship with ICT, and it was asserted on behalf of the respondents that they had a licence agreement with ICT, and that ICT were not permitted to sell into Australia.\nSince that time, the respondents began negotiations concerning Pecaform with Danley, which extended until February 2008.\nOn 5 July 2006, there was a telephone discussion between Mr Underwood for Danley, and Mr Baron for the respondents, concerning ICT, about the possibility of the second respondent continuing to supply Danley itself, after ICT production was integrated into the Max Frank organisation.\nOn 13 October 2006, there was a meeting between Mr Baron and Mr Wilson, for the respondents, and Mr Underwood at Danley's office in Brisbane.\nOn that occasion, Mr Baron said that Peca GmbH would have to \"enter the Australian market directly to protect our intellectual property rights\" and also indicated they would \"hold back launching our product in Australia via other parties to give you a chance to have your discussions with Mr Chong.\n\" (Mr Chong is from ICT).\nIn about October or November 2006, Mr Underwood became aware that Peca GmbH had lodged its Trade Mark application for Pecaform in Australia.\nOn 9 and 10 May 2007, at a meeting with Mr Baron and Mr Wilson for the respondents and Mr Underwood, Mr Avey and Mr Ireland in Brisbane.\n We understand the licence situation regarding ICT and we would prefer to work with a larger reputable company like Frank.\n On 14 June 2007, Mr Avey emailed to Mr Baron: \n Danley ... are committed to developing a long term, mutually beneficial relationship with Frank in Australia and New Zealand.\nIn particular we would like to become the distributor in these regions for the Peca range of products.\n 2 July 2007 was the sealing date for registration of the Trade Mark \"Pecaform\" by Peca GmbH in Australia.\nOn 16 July 2007, Danley applied for registration of the Trade Mark \"Footi-Form\" in Australia.\n On 13 September 2007, Mr Avey sent an email to Mr Baron in which he said: \n Danley sees Frank as an appropriate long term partner for the supply of Pecaform.\n On 26-29 September, at the New Zealand Concrete Conference, Mr Baron and Mr Wilson on behalf of the respondents make their position plain that \" Pecafil and Pecaform are Max Frank registered trademarks\" and that Frank \"has not taken legal action against ICT so far out of consideration for Danley ...\" On 17 October 2007, Mr Baron sent a revised Memorandum of Understanding to Mr Avey who, according to Mr Baron, told him at the Concrete 2007 Convention in Adelaide, \"I am happy with the Memorandum of Understanding, it just needs some fine tuning\".\nMr Avey disputes that statement.\nThere were a further series of emails from 23 October 2007 until 21 December 2007 between Mr Baron and Mr Avey in respect of the supply by the second respondent directly to Danley.\nThen, on 13 February 2008, in an important telephone conversation, Mr Baron referred to the agreement being in final form and to \"bringing stock to Singapore as advised by email on 13 November 2007, 6 December 2007, 21 December 2007, and 21 January 2008\".\nAccording to Mr Baron, he said, \"I need you to place the first orders so that we can get the containers on the water without disruption\".\nTo which Mr Avey replied, \"We have done a lot of soul searching and decided that given our ten year long relationship with ICT, we have decided to stay with them\".\nTo which Mr Baron replied, \"You've strung us along then?\n\" Mr Baron says that Mr Avey was silent, and Mr Baron then said, \"I think it's a bad decision and this will force us to take legal action to protect our rights\".\nSubsequent to that telephone conversation, Simone Lawyers, legal representatives, acting on behalf of the second respondent, sent a letter dated 19 February 2008, which was received by Danley on 25 February 2008, complaining, amongst other things that, \"your use of the trade marks constitutes infringement of our client's trade mark\".\n The first I became aware directly from the Respondents that the Respondents disputed that the Applicant's right and entitlement to use the name Pecaform in conjunction with its Pecaform products in Australia was when the Applicant received a letter from Simone Lawyers, legal representatives acting on behalf of the Second Respondent, dated 19 February 2008 ... \n The case for interlocutory relief for Danley is based on two contentions: \n(1) notwithstanding that the second respondent is the registered proprietor of the Trade Mark Pecaform, there remains a question to be tried that the true owner at common law is Danley; and \n(2) Danley has very strong grounds, based on, amongst other sections, s 124, s 129 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 (Cth) (the Trade Marks Act ), to resist any infringement action by the second respondent.\n(a) restraining representations that Danley is not able to sell in Australia products under the name of \"Pecaform\".\n(b) restraining the respondents from offering for sale Pecaform products.\n(c) restraining the respondents from making threats of Trade Mark infringements.\nIn my judgment, even if the two contentions of Danley are seriously arguable, the relief based on that conclusion is misconceived.\nConcerning the first contention, notwithstanding that the second respondent is the registered proprietor of Trade Mark number 1161336 \"Pecaform\" in class 6, the applicant at trial will seek cancellation of the registered mark.\nDanley submits that an issue will be the ownership of the \"Pecaform\" Trade Mark in Australia, the relevant date for determination of ownership of that mark being the date of application for the Trade Mark, 25 August 2006.\nFor Danley, it was submitted that the ownership of the Trade Mark will be determined by evidence as to the first use of the Trade Mark in Australia.\n ... Proprietorship can arise in one of two ways.\nIn the case of a mark that has never been used, the proprietor is the person who is the \"author\" of the mark and who has applied for its registration with the intention of using the mark: Re Hudson's Trade Marks (1986) 32 Ch D 311 at 319; Seven-Up Co v OT Ltd [1947] HCA 59 ; (1947) 75 CLR 203 ; [1947] ALR 436 ( Seven-up Co); Shell Co of Australia Ltd v Rohm &amp; Haas Co [1948] HCA 27 ; (1949) 78 CLR 601 at 626 [1948] HCA 27 ; ; [1949] ALR 661 ; 1A IPR 438 ( Shell Co of Australia ).\nAuthorship in this context is not confined to the person who originated the mark.\nA person may be the author even if he has copied a foreign mark; he or she need only be the first person to have applied the mark in Australia: Aston v Harlee Manufacturing co [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 400 [1960] HCA 47 ; ; [1960] ALR 605 citing Re Registered Trade Mark \"Yanx\"; Ex parte Amalgamated Tobacco Corp Ltd [1951] HCA 28 ; (1951) 82 CLR 199 at 202 ( Re Registered Trade Mark \"Yanx\").\nA person is also the proprietor of a mark if, at the time of application for registration, he or she is entitled to the exclusive use of that mark under the common law: Shell Co of Australia at 625, 627.\nAt common law that is the person who first used the mark.\n For Danley, it was submitted that: \n It cannot affect the Applicant's proprietorship of the trade mark in Australia, by authorship or by first use, that the trade mark belongs to one of the Respondents in foreign countries.\nIndeed, it is clear that the owner of a trade mark in Australia \"... may be the \"author\" of a trade mark, although he has deliberately copied or adapted a mark registered in a foreign country in respect of the same description of goods.\n[ Aston v Harlee Manufacturing Co [1960] HCA 47 ; (1960) 103 CLR 391 at 400].\n It was accepted that: \n It would be otherwise if the foreign owner (one of the Respondents or a company associated with them) had previously used the mark in Australia.\n In Aston it was said by Fullagar J, at 400: \n Again, it is otherwise if the opponent or person aggrieved has used the mark, for prior user by the foreign proprietor negatives the claim of the Australian applicant to \"authorship\".\nBut the user must be user in Australia: the most extensive user by another person in foreign countries will not avail by itself to defeat an applicant for registration in this country.\nIt has been said, however, that the Courts frown on these borrowings from abroad, and very slight evidence of user in Australia has been held sufficient to protect the proprietor of a foreign trade mark: The Seven Up Co v O.T.\nLtd [1947] HCA 59 ; [(1947) 75 CLR 203 at 211]...\nBut, where there has clearly been no user at all in Australia, an applicant for a trade mark identical with a mark registered in a foreign country is entitled to be regarded, so far as Australia is concerned, as the \"author\" of the mark.\nI can see no reason why that should not be so.\n(See also the case of Thai Gypsum Products Co Ltd v Waring and Gillow Pty Ltd (1994) 29 IPR 99).\n It was submitted that the respondents used the Trade Mark \"Pecaform\" in 33 countries, and they have used \"Pecaform\" and \"Pecafil\" in 66 countries.\nThat conduct is irrelevant to the question of first use of the Trade Mark in Australia, as the observations from Aston set out above indicate.\nThe question of first use in Australia being by Danley is challenged by the respondents.\n Smorgon was the first company to bring Pecaform product into Australia from Germany before Danley, sometime in the late 1980s.\n This hearsay evidence, says Danley, is not borne out by the facts which show that there was a single order by Smorgon on 10 August 1989, and a shipment to Smorgon of \"Pecafil\" product.\nWhile the evidence of prior use by the respondents of the mark \"Pecaform\" appears quite tenuous, it seems to me that for Danley all that that means is that there are prospects, perhaps even strong prospects, that it will be successful in the trial in its application to cancel the registration by the second respondent concerning the mark \"Pecaform\".\nThat does not, in my judgment, mean that a basis exists on which the Court may properly restrain the respondents until trial from saying that Danley is not able to sell in Australia products under the name \"Pecaform\", or provide a proper basis on which to restrain the respondents from offering for sale Pecaform products in Australia, or restraining the respondents from making threats of Trade Mark infringements.\nDanley argues that it has several defences to any potential Trade Mark claim.\n 129 Groundless threats of legal proceedings \n (1) If a person threatens to bring an action against another person ( threatened person ) on the ground that the threatened person has infringed:\n (a) a registered trade mark; or\n (b) a trade mark alleged by the person to be registered;\n a person aggrieved by the threat ( plaintiff ) may bring an action (either in a prescribed court or in any other court having jurisdiction) against the person making the threat ( defendant ).\n (2) The purpose of the action is to obtain from the court:\n (a) a declaration that the defendant has no grounds for making the threat; and\n (b) an injunction restraining the defendant from continuing to make the threat.\nThe plaintiff may also recover any damages that he or she has sustained because of the defendant's conduct.\n (4) The court may not find in favour of the plaintiff if the defendant satisfies the court that:\n (a) The trade mark is registered; and\n (b) the acts of the threatened person in respect of which the defendant threatened to bring an action constitute an infringement of the trade mark.\n Section 124(1) of the Trade Marks Act relevantly provides: \n 124 Prior use of identical trade mark etc. \n (1) A person does not infringe a registered trade mark by using an unregistered trade mark that is substantially identical with, or deceptively similar to, the registered trade mark in relation to:\n (a) goods similar to goods ( registered goods ) in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or\n (b) services closely related to registered goods; or\n (c) services similar to services ( registered services ) in respect of which the trade mark is registered; or\n (d) goods closely related to registered services;\n if the person, or the person and the person's predecessor in title, have continuously used in the course of trade the unregistered trade mark in relation to those goods or services from a time before:\n (e) the date of registration of the registered trade mark; or\n (f) the registered owner of the registered trade mark, or a predecessor in title, or a person who was a registered user of the trade mark under the repealed Act, first used the trade mark;\n whichever is earlier.\n Danley contends that it has continuously used an unregistered mark \"Pecaform\" from a date before the date of registration of the registered mark, 25 August 2006.\nThis claim is clearly dependent on establishing that there had been no first user by the second respondent earlier than the first user by Danley.\nIt is suggested that, in addition to a defence based on s 124(1) of the Trade Marks Act , there are defences under s 122(1)(f) and possibly under s 123 of the Trade Marks Act .\nAccepting the correctness of these propositions, in my opinion, does not establish an entitlement to an interlocutory injunction restraining the making of threats of Trade Mark infringement of a registered mark.\nEven if there is a serious question to be tried that Danley is the owner at common law of the mark \"Pecaform\" in relation to the construction product, notwithstanding that the second respondent is the registered proprietor of that Trade Mark in Australia, that does not indicate that the second respondent should be enjoined before trial from using that mark.\nPrima facie, the registered proprietor of a mark (or those claiming under it), is the only person entitled to use the mark on the goods for which the mark is registered.\nThe fact that there is an arguable case that the title is defective does not, in my view, generate a positive entitlement in the person alleging the defect to restrain the registered owner from using the mark.\nAustralian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63 ; (2001) 208 CLR 199 makes plain that where interlocutory relief is sought it is necessary to identify the legal or equitable rights which are to be determined at the trial, and in respect of which final relief is sought.\nIn the principal proceedings, the applicant claims: A declaration that the threats of legal proceedings for trade mark infringement made by the Respondents to the Applicant are groundless within the meaning of section 129 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 .\nAn order that the Respondents be permanently restrained, whether by themselves, their directors, officers, employees, servants, agents or otherwise from continuing to make threats of trade mark infringement, by any means including, but not limited to, verbal statements, letters, e-mails or otherwise to the Applicant or any other person.\nFurther in respect of the matters referred to at paragraphs 1 and 2 herein, damages.\nAn order pursuant to section 88 of the Trade Marks Act 1995 that the register of trade marks be rectified by the cancellation or removal of trade mark 1161336.\n (a) is misleading and deceptive or likely to mislead and deceive in contravention of section 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (\"TPA\"); and\n (b) is a contravention of section 53(c) and (d) of the TPA.\n A declaration that the conduct of the Respondents, whether by themselves, their directors, officers, employees, servants, agents or otherwise of manufacturing, importing, advertising, offering for sale, distributing, supplying or selling the infringing products within Australia constitutes passing off by the First Respondent of its business and products as being business and/or products of, or related to, or licensed by, or having authorisation of or a connection with, the Applicant.\nAn order restraining the Respondents and each of them, their directors, officers, employees, servants agents or otherwise from manufacturing, distributing, promoting, offering for sale or selling in Australia or causing or permitting (directly or indirectly) to be manufactured, distributed, promoted, offered for sale or sold in Australia the Infringing Products.\nFurther in respect of the matters referred to at paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 herein, damages under section 82 of the TPA.\nFurther in respect of the matters referred to at paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 herein, further or other orders under section 87 of the TPA.\nFurther in respect of the matters referred to at paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 herein, damages for passing --- off.\nFurther and/or in the alternative to the relief sought in the preceding paragraph, at the option of the Applicant, an account of the profits made by the Respondents and each of them by the said passing off and payment of the amount found to be due on the taking of such account.\nDelivery up on oath to the Applicant or its duly authorised agent for destruction under supervision of all goods, catalogues, price lists, brochures and other documents and materials, including materials which are or which are capable of being stored, generated or transmitted by an electronic media in the possession, power, custody, or control of the Respondents, bearing the sign Pecaform.\nPursuant to section 80 of the TPA an injunction restraining the Respondents by themselves, their directors, officers, employees, servants, agents or otherwise howsoever from contravening section 52 of the TPA by the publication of misleading and deceptive documents and representations, such representations being to the effect that the Applicant is not able and or entitled to sell in Australia and New Zealand products under the name \"Pecaform\" or that the Applicant is not able to sell or supply to the market in Australia or New Zealand products that the Applicant has been selling and supplying to the market in Australia and New Zealand under the name Pecaform.\nDamages payable by the Respondents for loss and damage incurred by the Applicant as a result of the Respondents' contravention of section 52 of the TPA as referred to in the preceding paragraph herein.\nIn the alternative to the relief sought in the preceding paragraph herein, at the option of the Applicant, an account of the profits made by the Respondents and or each of them by reason of the wrongful conduct of the Respondents by reason of their wrongful conduct.\nAll such accounts/enquiries as to damages and profit in respect of the contravention of section 52 of the TPA and discovery in aid thereof as may be necessary.\n 17 Interest pursuant to Section 51A of the Federal Court Act 1976 (Cth).\n 18 Costs.\n Such further or other orders, directions and relief as may be necessary or as this Honourable Court deems fit.\nOrders 1 to 3 concern the making of threats of legal proceedings for Trade Mark infringement.\nOrder 4 seeks cancellation of Trade Mark No 1161336.\nOrder 5 alleges breach of the Trade Practices Act and order 6 alleges passing off, in respect of conduct by the respondents in manufacturing, importing, advertising, offering for sale, distributing, supplying or selling Pecaform products.\nOrders 8 -12 are ancillary to the Trade Practices and passing off claims.\nOrder 13 seeks an injunction restraining the respondents from specified conduct said to be in breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act .\nOrder 14 appears to be a duplication of order 8, in relation to the matters the subject of what is sought in order 5(a).\nOrders 15-17 are ancillary to 14.\nThere is no relief seeking a declaration that Danley is the proprietor of the mark \"Pecaform\".\nAs to the relief sought concerning misrepresentations under the TPA, and passing off, there is a singular lack of evidence establishing a reputation or goodwill in Danley in the mark \"Pecaform\".\nThere is evidence of use in Australia by Danley of that mark, sometimes in conjunction with the description \"Danley Pecaform\", for a number of years, and sales by Danley of product by reference to the Pecaform mark.\nBut the necessary reputation or goodwill is left to be inferred.\n There is not, nor could there be, any suggestion (as there sometimes is in such cases) that the Respondents have opportunistically taken the Applicant's known existing name or mark.\nOn the contrary, the reverse is the case.\nThe Second Respondent have registered and used the mark internationally for decades.\nIt has also, to the knowledge of the Applicant, made application for, and obtained, the registration of its mark in Australia.\nThe Applicant has never made any attempt to do so, and attempts to explain this now as an \"oversight\".\nBut now it seeks to appropriate the name in Australia, having \"strung the Respondents along' since late 2006.\n I am satisfied on the evidence that, immediately after the phone calls between Mr Baron and Mr Avey on 13 February 2008, Danley deleted all reference to Pecaform from its website.\nIt had already, on 16 July 2007, applied for the registration of the Trade Mark \"Footi-Form\" for use in relation to the product it previously sold as Pecaform.\n(It was registered in Australia on 3 October 2007).\nIts internal documents since 2006 no longer refer to sales as Pecaform sales, and the last three of those documents in evidence lists the sales as Footi-Form sales.\nIts 2008-2009 pdf product summary, downloadable from the website, lists only Footi-Form, not Pecaform.\nMr Underwood cites the 2006-2007 brochure (which lists Pecaform) as the \"current\" brochure.\nThis is disingenuous, as the pdf document is a \"file format that has captured all the elements of a printed document\": see NSW Supreme Court Practice Note 127.\nThe present marketing of Danley does not appear to refer to Pecaform at all, and the mark seems to all intents and purposes to have been replaced by Footi-Form.\nIn my view, there are discretionary considerations indicating that the balance of convenience is strongly against the grant of injunctive relief.\nFirst, the applicant, it seems to me, no longer uses the mark, with the consequence that refusal of injunctive relief will not affect its current actual activities.\nThe respondents have evidenced an intention to use the mark on class 6 goods in Australia, and its actual activities would be affected by the grant of interlocutory injunctive relief.\nSecondly, it seems to me that the history of negotiations between the applicant and the respondents tends strongly against the grant of injunctive relief.\nBy at least November 2006, Mr Underwood knew of the respondents' intellectual property rights, including Australian Trade Mark rights, in relation to Pecaform.\n During 2006 and 2007, the Applicant and the Respondent negotiated toward entering an agreement whereby the Applicant would become the Respondents' representative in Australia for up to 10 years.\n Included in those negotiations was a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2007.\nThat document, in the first paragraph, made explicit the Respondents' claim to ownership of the PECAFORM mark.\nIt was the subject of careful and detailed text based negotiation.\nAt no point during the negotiation did the Applicant assert ownership of the PECAFORM mark.\n...\nIt was not until 13 February 2008 that the Applicant reversed its long-standing previous position and announced that it would not, after all, be proceeding with the arrangement with the Respondents.\n Thirdly, I regard it as significant that Danley registered the Trade Mark \"Footi-Form\" on 16 July 2007, and internally recorded all its sales of class 6 goods as \"Footi-Form sales\", at least for the period January 2008 to 31 July 2008.\nIt is also significant in my opinion that when Mr Avey informed Mr Baron on 13 February 2008 that the negotiations were at an end, \"Pecaform\" was erased from Danley's website the following day.\nThe respondents' solicitor wrote on 19 February 2008 complaining of Danley's use of Pecaform, and Danley instituted these proceedings on 3 March 2008.\nIt is also significant that the Statement of Claim was amended on 23 April 2008, only then to include a claim that Danley was the common law owner of the mark Pecaform.\nWhile I am satisfied that there are serious questions to be tried concerning the two contentions advanced by Danley as indicated earlier, I am not satisfied that, were they to be resolved in Danley's favour, damages would not be an adequate remedy for any harm suffered by Danley.\nFurther, the balance of convenience tips strongly against the grant of interlocutory relief.\nI will hear the parties on costs.\n I certify that the preceding ninety-three (93) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Spender.\nDated: 31 March 2009\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr A Franklin SC \n Solicitor for the

        "description": "1 This is an application pursuant to Pt 16 Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (\"the Act \") brought by the Construction Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (\"CFMEU\") (\"the applicant\") on behalf of two individuals, Mr James McIlroy and Ms Anita St Henry, to whom I shall refer collectively as \"the employees\" where appropriate.\nMr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were employed by CE Marshall &amp; Sons Pty Ltd (\"the respondent\") at Blackwater Mine during the period 15 February 2006 to 10 May 2006.\nTheir employment was terminated on 10 May 2006.\nThe applicant asserts that the respondent dismissed the employees for a prohibited reason, namely because they were members of an industrial association and/or because as members of an industrial association they did an act for the purposes of furthering or protecting the industrial interests of the applicant, which act was both lawful and within the limits of an authority expressly conferred by the applicant under its rules.\n&#8226; declarations that the respondent has breached Pt 16 of the Act , in particular s 792(1) \n&#8226; an order imposing penalties upon the respondent for breach of Pt 16 of the Act pursuant to s 807(1)(a) \n&#8226; orders reinstating Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry pursuant to s 807(3) of the Act \n&#8226; orders awarding compensation to Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry pursuant to s 807(1)(b) of the Act \n&#8226; any other order the Court sees fit.\n3 Section 792(1) is a civil remedy provision: s 792(2).\n(a) an order imposing a pecuniary penalty on the defendant;\n(b) an order requiring the defendant to pay a specified amount to another person as compensation for damage suffered by the other person as a result of the contravention;\n(c) any other order that the Court considers appropriate.\n4 Section 807(3) provides that orders which may be made under s 807(1)(c) include injunctions and any other orders the Court considers necessary.\n5 The parties agreed that the trial should proceed on the basis that any issue as to pecuniary penalties pursuant to s 807(1)(a) of the Act would not be dealt with during the current hearing and would, if necessary, be considered at a later date.\nAccordingly, only submissions as to the remedies of compensation and reinstatement formed part of Counsel's arguments during the trial.\n6 During the course of the hearing two key issues emerged for consideration.\n1.\nWhether the respondent dismissed the employees contrary to s 792(1)(a) for the prohibited reasons set out in s 793(1)(a) and (o).\nSpecifically, whether the respondent terminated the employment of the employees for the reasons that they were members of an industrial association and/or because as members of an industrial association they did an act for the purposes of furthering or protecting the industrial interests of the applicant, which act was both lawful and within the limits of an authority expressly conferred by the applicant under its rules.\n2.\nWhether in fact the employees were members of an industrial association, namely the applicant, at the relevant time.\n7 Predominately, the evidence given on affidavit and during the hearing related to the first issue.\nThe issue as to whether the employees had actually become members of the applicant at the relevant time was the subject of contention during the hearing, to the extent that at the conclusion of his submissions in reply, Mr Hinson SC on behalf of the applicant sought the leave of the Court to amend the applicant's statement of claim to include a claim that the employees were dismissed in contravention of s 793(1)(a) because they proposed to become members of an industrial association.\nAfter hearing submissions by both Mr Hinson SC, and Mr Horneman-Wren on behalf of the respondent, I refused leave on the ground that, in view of the timing of the application to amend, the amendment could not be made without substantial injustice to the respondent.\nThis was particularly so in view of the facts that the applicant claimed the respondent was in breach of a civil remedy provision (as a result of which the respondent could be subject to penalties), and further that the respondent bore the onus of proof so far as the case concerned reasons for termination of employment.\n8 Clearly, if the reasons for termination of the employees' employment were not prohibited by the relevant sections of Act claimed by the applicant, the claim of the applicant would not succeed, irrespective whether the employees were members of the applicant at the relevant time.\nFor this reason, and in view of the manner in which the trial was conducted, I propose to deal first with the issues concerning termination of employment, and then deal, if necessary, with the issue whether the employees were members of the applicant at the relevant time.\n9 There is considerable common ground between the parties as to the background facts.\n10 The respondent company specialises in earthmoving, overburden removal, mud removal, dozer stripping, rehabilitation and topsoil works.\nMr McIlroy performed the duties of plant operator.\nMs St Henry performed duties as a truck driver; she is also qualified as a \"Trainer Assessor\" and trained new employees in this capacity.\n11 Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry lived together, and were at various times described by other witnesses as married or engaged to be married.\nIt is clear that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were regarded as \"a couple\" by other employees, including management, of the respondent.\n12 Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry had previously been employed by the respondent on or about 15 February 2005.\nI understand that there had been allegations by Ms St Henry of workplace bullying and sexual harassment by another employee of the respondent at that time.\nA number of witnesses also deposed that there had been rivalry between Mr McIlroy and that same employee at that time (affidavit of David McDonald sworn 19 October 2006) which resulted in shouting matches between them (affidavit of John Date sworn 19 October 2006).\nAt that time, Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry had remained in employment with the respondent until 17 June 2005 (in the case of Mr McIlroy) and 8 July 2005 (in the case of Ms St Henry).\n13 Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were re-employed by the respondent at Blackwater Mine during the period 15 February 2006 to 10 May 2006.\nThey were re-employed following discussions with Mr Bradley Marshall, who was at all relevant times the managing director of the respondent.\nUsually decisions concerning employment of staff of the respondent are made by Ms Melody Burey, the project manager of the respondent.\nI understand however that Ms Burey was on leave at the time that the employees were re-employed.\n14 The employees each deposed that, whilst being offered employment by Mr Bradley Marshall, they were told that they were not to \"cause any trouble\" for 12 months.\n15 It is common ground that their employment was terminated on 10 May 2006 during separate meetings held with Ms Burey.\nAt those separate meetings with each of the employees, Ms Burey handed Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry letters in identical terms terminating their employment.\n As you are aware, CE Marshall and Sons recently offered you employment on the basis of a three month probationary period, commencing on 15 February 2006.\nUnfortunately, CE Marshall and Sons shall not be seeking to extend this offer and shall terminate your employment on the Monday, 15 May 2006, as explained to you by myself and Production Superintendent, Pete Beddows.\nI would like to thankyou for your efforts during your time with CE Marshall and Sons and wish you well in your future employment endeavours.\n16 Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry gave evidence that they were unaware that they had been employed by the respondent on 15 February 2006 on a 3 month probationary period.\n A working trial period of three months from the commencement of employment shall apply to new employees of the company.\n17 The existence of the probationary period to which Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were subject was not an issue for the purposes of this hearing.\n18 On 1 May 2006, an incident occurred whereby the truck Ms St Henry was driving reversed on to a 750 mm rock on the site.\nEvidence was given that this action was in breach of directions to employees, due to possible damage which could result to tyres and in the context of a worldwide tyre shortage for such vehicles.\nAs a result of this incident, Ms St Henry received a one-shift suspension.\nMs St Henry deposed that, although she did not believe the incident was her fault, she accepted this suspension.\nI understand that a consequence of a suspension is a loss of income for the employee.\n19 On 2 May 2006 when Ms St Henry was notified of her one-shift suspension, Mr McIlroy deposed that he was informed by Mr Mal Lilly of Ms St Henry's suspension.\nThere is some contention as to what happened next.\nMr McIlroy deposed that he immediately returned to the go-line but that he did not drive the truck in an erratic or dangerous manner or at an excessive speed; and that in his view, based on his experience as a driver, it was appropriate to turn off the truck immediately as the engine had barely \"warmed up\".\nHowever Mr Lilly, senior shift supervisor of \"D crew\" whose members included both Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry, deposed that Mr McIlroy lost his temper, drove off quickly and in top gear towards the go-line, that in his view Mr McIlroy had driven the truck at approximately 60 kilometres per hour and had caused the brakes to lock, that the truck had slid for at least 10 metres, and that Mr McIlroy had immediately switched off the ignition of the truck without allowing the engine to idle, which is a serious breach of the rules and can cause serious damage to trucks of this nature.\nMr Lilly also deposed that he had exchanged heated words with Mr McIlroy about Mr McIlroy's treatment of the truck and Ms St Henry's suspension.\n20 Mr Lilly prepared a case note recording the incident which was exhibited to his affidavit.\nI understand however that Mr McIlroy was not formally disciplined in relation to this incident.\n21 Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry each deposed that on or about 9 March 2006 they were attended at their home by Mr Ross Kumeroa, a union organiser with the applicant.\nMs St Henry deposed that she had never previously been a union member, and that both she and Mr McIlroy advised Mr Kumeroa that they were interested in becoming involved with the applicant.\nMr Kumeroa gave evidence that he left the employees with the applicant's \"Application for Membership\" forms on 9 March 2006 (TS 8 Feb 2007 p 17 ll 7-10).\n22 A workplace organising committee meeting of the applicant was held on or about 18 April 2006, which Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry attended.\n23 Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry deposed that they approached workers in D crew during late April and early May 2006 to provide them with invitations (prepared by the applicant) to attend a meeting organised by the applicant to be held on 9 May 2006 where a presentation explaining the new workplace relations laws was to occur.\nThe meeting was held on that day, with a presentation given by Mr Kumeroa.\n24 On 3 May 2006 both Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry signed \"Application for Membership\" forms to join the applicant.\nIn evidence in cross-examination, Mr Kumeroa said that the employees handed the signed application forms to him at the meeting of 9 May 2006 and that the forms were processed by the applicant's head office in Brisbane on 16 May 2006 (TS 8 Feb 2007 p 17 ll 45-48).\n25 There is dispute between the parties as to when Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry became members of the applicant.\n26 So far as relevant s 792 of the Act provides:\n (1) An employer must not, for a prohibited reason, or for reasons that include a prohibited reason, do or threaten to do any of the following: \n (a) dismiss an employee;\n (b) injure an employee in his or her employment;\n (c) alter the position of an employee to the employee's prejudice;\n (d) refuse to employ another person as an employee;\n (e) discriminate against another person in the terms or conditions on which the employer offers to employ the other person as an employee.\n Subsection (1) is a civil remedy provision.\n27 So far as relevant s 793 of the Act provides:\n (1) Conduct referred to in subsection 792(1) or (5) is for a prohibited reason if it is carried out because the employee, independent contractor or other person concerned: \n (a) is, has been, proposes to become or has at any time proposed to become an officer, delegate or member of an industrial association; or\n ............\n (o) as an officer or member of an industrial association, has done, or proposes to do, an act or thing for the purpose of furthering or protecting the industrial interests of the industrial association, being an act or thing that is: \n (i) lawful; and\n (ii) within the limits of an authority expressly conferred on the employee, independent contractor or other person by the industrial association under its rules; or\n ............. \n28 As explained by Nicholson J in Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority [1999] FCA 899 ; (1999) 93 FCR 34 at 69, the words \"or for reasons that include a prohibited reason\" in s 792(1) permit a reason to be an operative reason provided it is one of the reasons for the conduct.\nAs his Honour pointed out, it would not therefore have to be the \"substantial\" reason.\n29 An important aspect of considering applications pursuant to Pt 16 of the Act is the onus of proof.\n (1) If: \n (a) in an application under section 807 relating to a person's conduct, it is alleged that the conduct was, or is being, carried out for a particular reason or with a particular intent; and\n (b) for the person to carry out the conduct for that reason or with that intent would constitute a contravention of this Part; \n it is presumed, in proceedings under this Division arising from the application, that the conduct was, or is being, carried out for that reason or with that intent, unless the person proves otherwise.\n(2) This section does not apply in relation to the granting of an interim injunction.\n30 I have already explained that s 807 sets out penalties for contraventions of, inter alia , s 792(1).\n31 Simply, the effect of s 809(1) is that there is a reversal of the onus of proof where an applicant brings a claim of this nature.\nSo, in this case where the applicant claims that the respondent terminated the employment of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry for a prohibited reason (namely because they were members of an industrial association and/or because as members of an industrial association they did an act for the purposes of furthering or protecting the industrial interests of the applicant, which act was both lawful and within the limits of an authority expressly conferred by the applicant under its rules) the onus is on the respondent to prove otherwise.\n If the applicant proves the conduct and alleges that the conduct was carried out for a prohibited reason, it is for the respondent to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that it was not motivated by an impermissible reason.......\nThe reversal of the onus in respect of proof of the reasons for the conduct is a recognition that \"the circumstances by reason of which an employer may take action against an employee are, of necessity, peculiarly with the knowledge of the employer\": Heidt v Chrysler Australia Ltd at 267.\n(cf recent comments of Buchanan J in Seymour v Saint-Gobain Abrasives Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1452 at [28] ).\n33 Accordingly, in most cases an explanation of the real reason for dismissal consistent with the absence of a prohibited reason is, in a practical sense, also necessary to rebut the presumption (cf Buchanan J in Seymour [2006] FCA 1452 at [29] ).\nThis explanation must appear in the evidence of the person or persons who made the decision to terminate the employment of the relevant employees.\n34 Section 729 of the Act provides:\n A court hearing a proceeding under a civil remedy provision must apply the rules of evidence and procedure for civil matters.\n35 The rules of evidence for civil matters are set out in s 140 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth):\n (1) In a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities.\n (2) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: \n (a) the nature of the cause of action or defence; and\n (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding; and\n (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.\n36 I note that both Nicholson J in Maritime Union of Australia [1999] FCA 899 ; 93 FCR 34 and Buchanan J in Seymour [2006] FCA 1452 recognised that it is for the respondent to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the termination was not motivated by an impermissible reason.\nMr Hinson SC on behalf of the applicant submitted that the standard of proof in this case was the civil standard of the balance of probabilities.\n37 Mr Horneman-Wren on behalf of the respondent however submitted that in fact the burden of proof was akin to the Briginshaw test ( Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 ; (1938) 60 CLR 336) and therefore required proof to a higher standard than a mere balance of probabilities.\n This does not mean that some standard of persuasion is fixed intermediate between the satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt required upon a criminal inquest and the reasonable satisfaction which in a civil issue may, not must, be based on a preponderance of probability.\nIt means that the nature of the issue necessarily affects the process by which reasonable satisfaction is attained.\nWhen, in a civil proceeding, a question arises whether a crime has been committed, the standard of persuasion is, according to the better opinion, the same as upon other civil issues...\nBut consistently with this opinion, weight is given to the presumption of innocence and exactness of proof is expected.\n39 The case before me involves the application of civil remedy provisions, and penalties which can be awarded against the respondent if appropriate.\nIn my view the issue raised by Mr Horneman-Wren may be addressed by recognising that the civil standard of proof - that is, the balance of probabilities --- is applicable as required by s 140(1) Evidence Act , however in applying the civil standard it is appropriate to take into account the issues prescribed in s 140(2).\nThis does not mean that I am required to apply a higher standard of proof than the \"mere balance of probabilities\" as submitted by Counsel.\nIt does, however, require me in this case, in applying the civil standard, to take into account the nature of the claim, the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and the gravity of the matters alleged.\nIn particular in the context of a civil remedy provision, I take into account the fact and the nature of the penalties which can be awarded against the respondent.\nThis approach is consistent with the approach taken by Nicholson J in Maritime Union of Australia 93 FCR at 65.\nThe duty of the court in such cases to take into account issues specified in s 140(2) has also been recognised in other Federal Court decisions including The Employment Advocate v National Union of Workers [2000] FCA 710 ; (2000) 100 FCR 454 at 464 and Hamberger v CFMEU (2000) 104 IR 45 at 49.\n40 Accordingly, in my view the civil standard of balance of probabilities, prescribed by s 140(1) and (2) Evidence Act , applies in this case.\n41 The applicant submits in the case before me that the reasons for termination of the employment of the employees by Ms Burey on behalf of the respondent do not stand scrutiny.\nAt the time of termination of employment, no reasons were given by Ms Burey to the employees.\nThe inference can be drawn that it was their union involvement which was the real reason for dismissal, because the conduct of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry cited by Ms Burey was not sufficiently serious to warrant dismissal.\n&#8226; In relation to Mr McIlroy:\n o Mr McIlroy was not censured at the time for this incident\n&#8226; In relation to Ms St Henry driving her truck on to a 750 mm rock:\n o Ms St Henry had already received a one-shift suspension\n o after the incident she continued driving the truck for several hours indicating that the truck tyre was not damaged\n o this was Ms St Henry's first offence of this nature\n o no other driver who had been suspended for a similar incident had been dismissed.\n&#8226; Ms Burey failed to provide them with a reason for dismissal\n&#8226; Ms Burey did not follow the counseling process in cl 2.14 of the Certified Agreement following the incidents\n&#8226; Ms Burey did not consider the conduct sufficiently serious to act on it immediately and waited until Ms St Henry and Mr McIlroy had finished their next shift before terminating their employment.\n&#8226; this suggests that the reasons offered by Ms Burey for the dismissals were not the real reasons\n&#8226; the Court should not accept the respondent's evidence because it was not sufficiently cogent and compelling and\n&#8226; that leaves the presumption that the dismissal was for reasons prohibited by s 793.\n44 In summary, the respondent submitted that:\n&#8226; the Court could not fail to be satisfied that the respondent had excluded the alleged prohibited reasons as operative reasons for the terminations and\n&#8226; explanations as to the real and operative reasons for the terminations appeared in the evidence of the respondent.\n&#8226; the decision to terminate the employees at the end of their probation period was made on 4 May 2006 by Ms Burey, with some contribution by Mr Marshall following a discussion between Ms Burey, Mr Marshall and Mr Peter Beddow, the respondent's Production Superintendent\n&#8226; Ms Burey was influenced in her decision by information provided to her on 4 May 2006 by Mr Beddow as to the incidents involving the employees on 1 and 2 May 2006\n&#8226; Ms Burey discussed the incidents involving the employees with Mr Lilly, and read the employee case notes concerning the matters on the files of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry\n&#8226; Ms Burey was influenced predominately by the fact that both employees were still within their three months probation period and it was in her view permissible to terminate their employment at the end of that period without explanation to them\n&#8226; Ms Burey was unaware of the union status of the employees or their activities in relation to the union prior to or at the time of termination of their employment.\n46 As I indicated at the commencement of this judgment, a considerable amount of evidence was lead in relation to the reasons for termination of the employees.\nMost of this evidence was produced by witnesses for the respondent.\n Ms Melody Burey \n47 The evidence of Ms Melody Burey is of most significance to the issue of the reasons for termination.\nAs I have already stated, Ms Burey is the project manager for the respondent, and in this capacity she is responsible for employment-related issues including hiring employees and terminating their employment.\n48 That she was the individual responsible for the decision to terminate Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry is clear from her evidence, as well as the evidence of Mr Bradley Marshall and Mr Peter Beddow.\nThis fact was accepted by Mr Hinson SC of Counsel for the applicant in written submissions, and in oral submissions (TS 9 Feb 2006 p 185 ll 1-7).\n49 Ms Burey deposes that she reached the decision to terminate the employment of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry on 4 May 2006.\nShe made this decision after checking the date of expiration of their probationary period (a date she understood to be 15 May 2006), speaking with Mr Marshall, Mr Beddow and Mr Lilly concerning matters including the incidents on 1 and 2 May 2006, and reading the employees' personnel files.\n50 Ms Burey deposes that as at 4 May 2006 she did not know whether Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were members of any union.\nShe further deposes that it was not until after reading their affidavits in these proceedings that she became aware that they were members of the applicant.\n51 Ms Burey deposes that she was aware that on around 9 May 2006 there was going to be a union meeting to discuss the new WorkChoices Laws.\nShe deposes that \"I thought it was a good idea for people to have information about the new laws\".\n52 Ms Burey deposes that she was told on or about 10 May 2006 that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry, and other employees of CE Marshall &amp; Sons attended the meeting.\nHowever, Ms Burey deposes that \"Jim and Anita's attendance at the union meeting on 9 May 2006 had nothing to do with my decision to terminate their employment.\nI respect people's rights to be union members if they wish.\nThe reasons that their employment was terminated are those that I have set out above\".\n53 Ms Burey further deposes that she made the decision to terminate the employment of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry on 4 May 2006 and prepared the letters to this effect.\nThese letters were dated 10 May 2006 as Ms Burey had ascertained that this would be the end of their next shift, but still within the probationary period, and thus an appropriate time to advise Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry of her decision.\nIn cross-examination Ms Burey indicated that when typing the letters she had anticipated that Mr Beddow would be in attendance at the meetings with Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry but on 10 May 2006 he was delayed in the field organising production and that this was explained to Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry during their respective meetings (TS 8 Feb 2007 p 98 l 45 - p 99 l 2).\nThis evidence is supported by Mr Beddow's response in cross-examination that he would normally be in attendance during termination of employment meetings (TS 8 Feb 2007 p 118 ll 17-35).\n54 As I noted earlier in this judgment, Mr Marshall was at all relevant times the managing director of the applicant.\nFurther for the purposes of this claim it is relevant to note that Mr Marshall made the decision to re-hire the employees in February 2006, and he was later consulted by Ms Burey in connection with her decision to terminate the employment of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry.\n Until I received the Federal Court documents in these proceedings I had no idea whether Jim or Anita were members of any union or were in any way involved in union activities......I have been a member of the CFMEU in the past.\nI was a member for 4 or 5 years whilst I worked at Yarrabi Mine......\nI respect the right of all employees to be or not to be members of a union.\n56 Mr Marshall further deposes that he had no knowledge of the 9 May 2006 union meeting.\n57 Mr Beddow, Production Superintendent for the respondent, deposes that he had a conversation with Ms Burey and Mr Marshall about Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry on 4 May 2006.\nDuring this conversation Mr Beddow relayed to Ms Burey his knowledge of the incidents of 1 and 2 May 2006 involving Ms St Henry's suspension and Mr McIlroy's response.\n58 However, it is clear that Mr Beddow did not have any role in the termination of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry (affidavit of Peter Beddow sworn 23 October 2006 and cross examination --- see TS 9 Feb 2007 p 118 ll 1-13) beyond being consulted as a courtesy by Ms Burey.\nMr Beddow however gave evidence during cross-examination that he would normally be present when Ms Burey terminated an employee because he had more personal contact with employees on site than Ms Burey did (TS 9 Feb 2007 p 118 ll 17-33).\n59 Further, and in any event, Mr Beddow deposes that he did not know prior to their termination that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were union members.\nHe deposes that whilst he may have known at around 9 or 10 May 2006 that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry had attended a union meeting, to his knowledge this did not affect the decision to terminate their employment, and in any event he understood that Ms Burey had decided several days before the union meeting occurred to terminate their employment.\n60 The evidence of Mr Irwin, a production supervisor with the respondent, essentially responded to the evidence in the affidavit of Mr Lalor, a witness for the applicant.\n61 Mr Irwin deposes that he does not recall any conversation with Mr Lalor on the evening of 10 May 2006; rather he recalled a telephone call from Mr Lalor on 11 May 2006.\nIt was not suggested by either party in cross-examination that there were in fact two conversations at or about this time.\nIn my view no issue turned on whether the conversation occurred on 10 May or 11 May 2006.\n62 Mr Irwin deposes that he was unaware that the employment of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry had been terminated until Mr Lalor informed him during the course of their conversation on 10 May or 11 May 2006.\nMr Irwin deposes that he did not say that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry \"have gone because of the Union meeting\".\nHe deposes that at that time he did not know that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry had gone to the meeting, that they had handed out invitations, that there had been a union meeting on 9 May 2006, or that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were members of a union.\nMr Irwin deposes that he can not recall the details of the conversation but that he would have asked Mr Lalor a number of questions about the meeting because he \"was keen to find out more about what I had just heard\".\n63 I have already referred in some detail to evidence given by Mr Lilly as to the incidents of 1 and 2 May 2006.\nFurther, Mr Lilly deposes that he asked Mr John Leeson, one of the operators of D crew employed by the respondent, about circumstances in which his name was mentioned at the union meeting of 9 May 2006.\nHowever he deposes that he did not ask Mr Leeson whether invitations to the union meeting were handed out by Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry.\nFurther, Mr Lilly deposes that he was not involved in the decision to terminate the employment of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry, and that he was unaware that their employment had been terminated until he came into work on 11 May 2006.\n64 The evidence of Mr Date, a production co-ordinator of the respondent, was relevant as to the incidents of 1 and 2 May 2006.\nMr Date also gave evidence as to events during the time the employees were employed by the respondent in 2005.\nMr Date deposed as to the incident where Ms St Henry backed her truck over a 750 mm rock, and his decision to suspend her for one shift following a meeting with Mr Lilly, Ms St Henry and Mr David McDonald on 2 May 2006.\nFurther, he deposed as to a later interchange with Mr McIlroy following Ms St Henry's suspension, where he said that Mr McIlroy was \"fiery\", \"yelling\" and \"abusing\" him.\n65 Mr Date deposed that he was not involved in the decision to terminate the employment of either Mr McIlroy or Ms St Henry, however during cross-examination he said that he spoke to Mr Beddow about the heated discussion he had had with Mr McIlroy (TS 9 Feb 2007 p 142 ll 25-26).\n66 Mr McDonald was training and safety co-ordinator of the respondent, and gave evidence as to events which occurred during the period the employees were first employed by the respondent.\nHe also deposed as to attending a meeting on 2 May 2006 between Ms St Henry, Mr Lilly and Mr Date as an independent person where the incident involving the 750 mm rock was discussed, and also driving Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry to Ms Burey's office at her request on 10 May 2006.\nMr McDonald however was not told the reason for the meetings between Ms Burey and the employees.\n Mr James McIlroy and Ms Anita St Henry \n67 I have already referred in some detail to evidence given by Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry as to the circumstances leading up to their termination.\nIn particular, I note their evidence concerning the incidents on 1 and 2 May 2006, and their interest in and application to join the applicant.\nI note further that no explanation was provided to them by Ms Burey, or anyone else involved in management of the respondent, for termination of their employment on 10 May 2006.\n68 I have already referred in some detail to evidence given by Mr Kumeroa concerning the commencement of membership by the employees of the applicant, and their involvement in union activities immediately prior to their termination of employment.\n69 In his affidavit sworn 29 August 2006 Mr Lalor, an operator employed by the respondent, deposes to a conversation which he had with his supervisor, Mr Irwin, on or about 10 May 2006, on learning that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry had been terminated as employees.\nMr Lalor deposes that he telephoned Mr Irwin and asked him \"what had happened\" to Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry.\n They have gone because of the Union meeting... Because they handed our invitations to the meeting and they were also causing trouble at the hardstand.\n Mr John Leeson \n70 Mr Leeson, an operator employed by the respondent, deposed as to a conversation between himself and Mr Lilly, his supervisor, on the topic of the 9 May 2006 union meeting.\nMr Leeson deposed that Mr Lilly expressed an interest in what had been said about himself (Mr Lilly) and the respondent at the union meeting on 9 May 2006, and whether Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry had given Mr Leeson the invitation to the union meeting.\n71 As I explained earlier in this judgment, in order for the applicant to be successful I need to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities on the evidence before me that the respondent has established that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were not dismissed for prohibited reasons within the meaning of s 793(1)(a) and (o) of the Act .\nAfter considering the evidence both affidavit and oral, I am satisfied that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were not dismissed for prohibited reasons within the meaning of s 793(1)(a) and (o) of the Act .\n1.\nIt was common ground between the parties that the decision-maker in the respondent in terminating the employment of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry was Ms Burey.\nShe had the role of, and responsibility for, hiring and firing staff.\nIn making her decision she consulted Mr Marshall and Mr Beddow, but the primary decision was hers.\n2.\nWith respect to Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry, from the evidence both in affidavit form and emerging in cross-examination, I am of the view that the reason that their employment was terminated was because Ms Burey took the view that they were \"trouble\" in the context of the performance of their duties on the site and in view of their history of employment with the respondent, and it was preferable to terminate the employment of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry before the expiration of the probation period.\nI make this finding with no comment as to the fairness or otherwise to either Mr McIlroy or Ms St Henry of the approach taken by Ms Burey or the respondent in so terminating their employment.\n &#8226; From the evidence of Mr Marshall, Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry it appears that, when the respondent re-hired the employees in February 2006, the events of 2005 when the employees had previously been in the employ of the respondent influenced the approach of Mr Marshall to re-hiring Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry.\nIt was common ground that the tenor of Mr Marshall's comments to Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry on re-hiring them was that the respondent required the employees not to cause trouble on the worksite during the next 12 months.\nIn my view the clear inference could be drawn that, from the perspective of the respondent and its decision-makers (in this case, Mr Marshall), Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were potentially troublesome employees.\n&#8226; It is clear from the evidence of Ms Burey that she considered Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry to be a \"package\" so far as their employment relationship with the respondent was concerned (TS 9 Feb 2007 p 92 ll 41-43).\nI note that the evidence indicates that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry had previously left the employment of the respondent at a similar time; they were re-hired together by Mr Marshall; they both worked in D crew; it was well-known that they were partners; and that it was, for example, appropriate for Mr McIlroy to take time off work to drive Ms St Henry home after her suspension.\nIt was also clear from Ms Burey's evidence, that it was natural for her to either retain them as employees together, or to terminate both employees at the same time, rather than to differentiate between them.\n&#8226; In my view the clear inference can be drawn that, although the conduct of Ms St Henry in backing the truck over a 750 mm rock was the subject of a suspension, it was the reaction of Mr McIlroy to the suspension which was the key factor in Ms Burey's decision that the employment of Mr McIlroy (and consequentially, of Ms St Henry), should be terminated.\nI note in particular evidence of Mr Lilly in relation to his view of Mr McIlroy's treatment of the truck and his subsequent verbal exchange with Mr McIlroy, and evidence of Mr Date as to his verbal exchange with Mr McIlroy.\nI note that Mr Lilly prepared a case note referring to the incident involving Mr McIlroy and the truck, which Ms Burey deposed that she had read.\nFurther, although no direct evidence was given on this point, it was clear during the course of the hearing that the actions of individual staff members of the respondent were the subject of interest and conversation by other staff members.\nIn this case it is clear that following the incidents of 1 and 2 May 2006, Mr Date had spoken to Mr Beddow concerning Mr Date's conversation with Mr McIlroy, and Mr Beddow subsequently spoke to Ms Burey and Mr Marshall on 4 May 2006.\nIt appears that Ms Burey had therefore been informed of the incidents of 1 and 2 May 2006 concerning Ms St Henry and Mr McIlroy.\n&#8226; Ms Burey discussed the termination of the employees with Mr Beddow and also Mr Marshall who had originally hired them.\nIt was clear from the evidence that Mr Beddow and Mr Marshall knew the employees, and had been aware of their previous experiences of employment with the respondent during 2005.\n3.\nI am also satisfied that Ms Burey had made up her mind on 4 May 2006 to terminate the employment of the employees.\nI find that Ms Burey was a credible witness.\n &#8226; The evidence of Mr Marshall and Mr Beddow as to their conversations with Ms Burey, and her awareness that the probation period for the employees had almost expired.\n&#8226; Her evidence that she thought it fair to allow the employees to complete their next shift, which finished on 10 May 2006, and then to terminate them as still permitted by the certified agreement within the probation period.\n&#8226; The contents of her letters of termination, which she said she had prepared on 4 May 2006, and which referred to the discussions with her and \"Pete Beddow\".\nIt is common ground that Mr Beddow was not present at the meeting between Ms Burey and the employees.\nHowever, as I noted earlier in this judgment, Mr Beddow during cross-examination gave evidence that it would have been usual for him to have been present at such a meeting, because he was better acquainted with site staff of the respondent, including Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry, than Ms Burey was.\nThe letters of termination referring to the presence of Mr Beddow are consistent with Ms Burey's evidence that she had prepared the letters several days prior to the meetings with Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry, in the expectation that Mr Beddow would be present at those meetings.\n4.\nAssuming for the moment, without considering the issue, that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were members of the applicant, I am satisfied that neither their membership of the applicant as an industrial organisation, nor any action performed by Mr McIlroy or Ms St Henry for the purposes of furthering or protecting the industrial interests of the applicant (including any actions concerning meetings called by the applicant), were in any way reasons operative to the termination of their employment.\nThe evidence is clear that any union membership or activities of Mr McIlroy or Ms St Henry were simply not issues in relation to the termination of their employment in the mind of Ms Burey as the decision-maker.\n &#8226; Ms Burey gave evidence that she was not aware of whether Mr McIlroy or Ms St Henry were members of the applicant, or of any of their activities concerning the applicant.\nI also note Ms Burey's evidence that she had no objection to a presentation concerning the new Workplace Relations laws.\nAs I indicated earlier, I find Ms Burey a credible witness.\n&#8226; Evidence given by Mr Lilly and Mr Leeson is, at best, of peripheral relevance.\nWith respect, this evidence is in the nature of workplace gossip and of little weight in the context of this claim.\nI note Mr Lilly's evidence that he had no knowledge of any involvement by Mr McIlroy or Ms St Henry in organising or participating in the union meeting, and accordingly it was unlikely that he would have asked Mr Leeson a question whether invitations had been distributed by Mr McIlroy or Ms St Henry.\nHowever even if the version of the conversation deposed to by Mr Leeson is accurate, in my view it is more likely that Mr Lilly was far more concerned that he had personally been the subject of criticism at the meeting.\nFurther, I note that Mr Lilly was not a decision-maker in the respondent concerning the termination of the employment of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry.\nI also note, and accept, Mr Lilly's evidence that he was unaware that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry had ceased working for the respondent until he came to work on 11 May 2006.\n&#8226; There is clear inconsistency in the evidence of Mr Irwin and Mr Lalor as to their conversation, in particular where Mr Lalor deposed that Mr Irwin had said that the employees' employment had been terminated \"because of the Union meeting\" and \"because they handed out invitations to the meeting and they were also causing trouble at the hardstand\".\nMr Irwin denied that he had attributed the termination of employment of the employees to their union activities, and deposed that he was unaware that the employees had ceased employment with the respondent until informed by Mr Lalor.\nIn my view, with respect, this evidence is in the nature of workplace gossip and speculation, and is of little weight in the context of this claim.\nEven if Mr Lalor's version of the conversation is accurate, in my view it is more likely that Mr Irwin was simply speculating as to the reasons for termination of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry, from a position of ignorance.\nIt is clear that Mr Irwin was not in any sense a decision-maker in this case, nor is there any evidence that he was privy to the processes by which the decision to terminate the employment of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry was made.\nI accept Mr Irwin's evidence that he was unaware that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry had been terminated until he was so informed by Mr Lalor.\nThis is consistent with the evidence of Mr McDonald and Mr Lilly, both of whom also deposed that they were unaware of the termination of the employment of the employees until after the event.\nFinally, it is also consistent with the fact that the Ms Burey was the decision-maker, and that, with the possible exceptions of Mr Marshall and Mr Beddow she had not communicated her decision to anyone other than the employees prior to 10 May 2006.\n Conclusion \n73 The application should be dismissed.\nEven if Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were members of the applicant at the relevant time (and I make no finding with respect to this issue) I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities, taking into account factors including the nature of the action, the respondent's defence, the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding and the gravity of the matters alleged (including the fact that the claim involves breach of a civil remedy provision), that Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were not dismissed by the respondent for prohibited reasons in the meaning of s 793(1)(a) and (o) of the Act .\nI am satisfied that the presumption that the termination of the employment of Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry was for a prohibited reason is rebutted by the credible evidence of Ms Burey and Mr Marshall as to the actual reasons for termination.\nWhether those reasons were \"fair\" reasons is not relevant --- the claim of the applicant as pleaded does not require me to consider the fairness or reasonableness of the conduct of the respondent (cf similar comments of Boon JR in Anderson v Edith Cowan University [1999] FCA 1802 at 104).\n74 As a result of this finding, it is unnecessary for me to consider whether Mr McIlroy and Ms St Henry were in fact members of the applicant at the relevant times.\n1.\nThe application be dismissed.\nI certify that the preceding seventy-four (74) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Collier.\nDated: 22 February 2007\n Counsel for the Applicant: M Hinson SC and D Kent \n Solicitor for the Applicant: Hall Payne Lawyers \n Counsel for the Respondent: A Horneman-Wren \n Solicitor for the Respondent: Franklin Athanasellis \n Date of Hearing: 8 February 2007 \n Date of Judgment: 22 February 2007 \n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \n URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2007/169.html"

        "description": "1 This is an appeal from a decision of Lloyd-Jones FM of 2 March 2007 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) dated 4 May 2005 and handed down on 26 May 2005.\n2 The appellant is a citizen of Fiji of Indian ethnicity who last arrived in Australia on 5 September 2004.\nOn 22 September 2004, he lodged an application for a Protection (Class XA) Visa pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act).\nOn 24 September 2004, a delegate of the Minister refused to grant him a Protection Visa, and, on 21 October 2004, he applied to the Tribunal for a review of that decision.\n The essence of the Applicant's claim for refugee status is that he has a well-founded fear of persecution inFiji because of his Indian ethnicity .\n As I advised the Applicant during the course of the Tribunal hearing held on 23 February 2005, although I accept that like many other Fijian Indians, he had been robbed, assaulted, beaten, abused, and badly treated by native Fijians between the years 1987 (after the first coup) and early 2003, on his own evidence to the Tribunal, there have been no incidents of note for the past 2 years; he did not apply for a Protection Visa when he was in Australia in September 2003; and independent country information indicates that the situation in Fiji had been stable for the last couple of years and a state of lawlessness no longer exists.\n In the light of the foregoing, as well as the evidence given by the Applicant to the Tribunal that his younger siblings continue to live with his parents at the same address (close to Lautoka) at which the Applicant had lived all his life before his departure to Australia; that neither he nor any member of his family had relocated to another part of Fiji; that no other members of his family have ever left Fiji; and that he had not departed Fiji when (a) he first obtained a Fiji passport in 1998, or (b) applied for refugee status when the opportunity arose when he first visited Australia for 3 weeks in September/October 2000.\nAlthough I note the Applicant's explanations for his and his family's failure to re-locate to another part of Fiji, I do not accept these as satisfactory, and they indicate to me that neither the Applicant nor his family genuinely fear persecution in Lautoka or genuinely believe that they are at real risk of persecution because of their ethnicity in the reasonably foreseeable future.\n After careful examination of all the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention-related reason in Fiji.\n (Emphasis added).\n4 The grounds of that amended application to the Federal Magistrates Court included the allegation that the appellant was a refugee within the meaning of the Convention, and particulars of that claim included the following: \n c. The applicant applied for a protection visa on the grounds of persecution because of his race and religion --- areas covered under the definition.\n d. The Tribunal erred in not considering the applicant's claims because it failed to take into account the precise nature of the applicant's claims.\n5 One of the grounds of his application to the Federal Magistrates Court alleged that:\n 3.\n...the transcript of the hearing will show that the Tribunal did not address any specific Convention related issues.\n Particulars \n a.\n b.\nThe Tribunal persisted in asking why the applicant had not applied for a protection visa when he visited Australia in 2003.\nIn pursuing this line of questinoing the Tribunal displayed bias by not accepting the applicant's explanation provided with evidence that showed that in 2003 he had paid a substantial sum of money to a migration agent to lodge a student visa application.\nThis was a crucial answer that the Tribunal did not take into consideration and in not considering the reasons given by the applicant, denied the applicant any real chance of presenting substantive rational reasons.\n c. The Tribunal erroneously reached the conclusion that because the applicant had not applied for a protection visa in 2003 meant that the applicant was not at risk of persecution.\n6 And a further ground:\n 4.\nThe applicant's submissions to the Tribunal contained detailed accounts of the serious harm he had suffered; details that the Tribunal refused to take into account.\nBy refusing to even take the claims into consideration the Tribunal denied the applicant procedural fairness.\n Particulars \n a.\nThe persecution which the applicant feared was for one or more of the reasons enumerated in the Convention definition --- race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\nThe applicant came within the definition under race, political opinion and religion, yet the Tribunal did not apply the definition to the applicant's case and in doing so refused to take the applicant's case into consideration.\n (Emphasis added).\n7 During the course of the oral hearing before the Tribunal, the appellant produced his passport and driving licence to the Tribunal Member.\n Q.\nYou didn't apply for a protection visa.\nYou applied for a student visa.\n A. Yeah.\n8 He was asked:\n Q.\nYou had a passport since 1998.\n A.\nYes.\n Q.\nWhy didn't you leave Fiji before you did?\n A.\nI did .. (not transcribable) .. 2000.\nI did.\n9 And later:\n Q.\n... you lodged application for a student visa two days before you left --- and you had been here a month and you didn't apply for a protection visa.\nThis is what this is about.\nA protection visa.\n A.\nYes.\n10 The reaons of the Federal Magistrate set out completely the amended application of the appellant to the Federal Magistrates Court, parts of which I have earlier set out.\nThat application was a very detailed application, of more than nine pages.\n 20.\nMr Leerdam [Counsel for the Minister] submits that the applicant has not specifically identified what claims the Tribunal did not consider.\nThe Tribunal accepted that the applicant may have been harmed in the past, but found that it did not consider there to be a real chance of persecution in the future.\nThere was no need for the Tribunal to identify every claim in relation to past harm which it accepted.\n12 Later, the Federal Magistrate said: \n 27.\nThe applicant claims that the Tribunal denied him procedural fairness in not determining his claims under the definition of race, politics, and membership of a particular social group .\nFurther that the Tribunal had a predetermined conclusion about his case and failed to address definitions under the Convention and his specific claims.\nThe applicant submits that these are matters fundamental to the function of the Tribunal under the Act.\nBy displaying such procedural unfairness, the Tribunal failed to properly determine the applicant's case.\nThe applicant questions how the Tribunal could have reached a conclusion without addressing the claims under race, politics and particular social group, which went to the heart of the applicant's case.\n (Emphasis added).\n13 Concerning the claim of persecution because of membership of a particular social group, the Federal Magistrate said:\n 31.\nThe applicant submits that he constitutes a particular social group against which the finding of protection ought to have been made.\nThe applicant submits that he belongs to a particular group of Indo-Fijians who are perceived to be wealthy land owners, which puts them in a vulnerable position.\n ... \n The applicant contends that by failing to identify this vulnerable group, it is unlikely that the Tribunal would then make a finding of effective state protection for this group.\nThe applicant contends that aspects of harassment and risk of this social group were not considered by the Tribunal.\n 32.\nMr Leerdam submits the applicant's claims were not that he belonged to a particular social group, but that he feared indigenous Fijians because of his Indian ethnicity.\nThe applicant also did not claim that he was targeted because he was perceived to be a wealthy land owner.\nThe particular social group now claimed by the applicant was therefore not raised before the Tribunal.\n14 The conclusion of the Federal Magistrate was:\n 36.\nThe applicant appeared as a self-represented litigant, however his amended application and submissions had been prepared by Mr Kumar of counsel, who regularly appears in this jurisdiction but withdrew before the hearing.\nThe applicant did not appear to understand the nature of his application or the contents of the documents which were prepared and filed on his behalf.\nHe declined to make oral submissions and said he would rely on the documents filed.\nAlthough there was a considerable volume of material filed for the applicant, their contents were formulaic, vague and in many particulars, repetitive.\n 37.\nMr Leerdam, appearing for the respondents, assisted the Court by addressing the relevant points that arose.\nI am satisfied that none of the gounds raised alleging jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal can be sustained.\nConsequently, the application should be dismissed.\n15 I note that Mr Kumar, who appeared for the appellant on this appeal, said from the Bar Table that the statement in the first sentence in [36] of the Federal Magistrate's reasons was incorrect.\nWhether that statement was correct is irrelevant to the disposition of the appeal.\n16 The first ground of appeal to this Court is that there was a failure by the Tribunal to consider all of the applicant's claims to warrant protection pursuant to the Convention.\nIn particular, his claim was not limited to his ethnicity (Indo-Fijian).\nHis claim also clearly regarded his involvement in politics with the Fiji Labor Party, and asserted a fear of persecution for political or imputed political opinion.\n17 It was submitted for the appellant that the findings and reasons of the Tribunal (which are set out above) clearly show that the Tribunal's consideration of the persecution claimed by the appellant was limited to ethnicity.\nThere was no consideration concerning the claim of persecution for the reason of political opinion.\n18 A further submission is that the Tribunal failed to consider his claim that he was at risk of persecution as a consequence of his membership of a particular social group, being that sub-group of Indo-Fijians who are lessors of Crown land.\n During this initial attack we were warned by these Fijians that sooner or later they were going to repossess their land and that they should start making plans to 'go back to India'.\n20 The claim is that the Tribunal considered only the ethnicity of the applicant, failed to consider these other claims, and merely relied on general country information regarding \"the situation in Fiji\".\n21 It was submitted by Mr Godwin, Counsel for the Minister, that while the Tribunal characterised the \"essence\" of the appellant's fears as being founded on his Indian ethnicity, this did not mean the Tribunal was excluding from consideration the other bases he gave for his fears.\n The conclusion of the RRT was based upon the actions of the appellant and his family which the RRT considered were inconsistent with actions of persons fearing persecution in the area where they lived (Lautoka).\nThis conclusion applied to persecution for whatever reason.\n23 In NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1, the Full Court (Black CJ, French, and Selway JJ) said at [60]:\n In SGBB v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) 199 ALR 364 at [17], Selway referred to the observation by Kirby J in Dranichnikov , at 405, that \"[t]he function of the Tribunal, as of the delegate, is to respond to the case that the applicant advances\".\nHe also referred to the observation by von Doussa J in SCAL v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 548 that \"[n]either the delegate nor the Tribunal is obliged to consider claims that have not been made\" (at [16]).\n 'But this does not mean the application is to be treated as an exercise in 19 th Century pleading.\n His Honour noted that the Full Court in Dranichnikov v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2000] FCA 1801 at [49] had said: \n 'The Tribunal must, of course, deal with the case raised by the material and evidence before it.\nAn asylum claimant does not have to pick the correct Convention \"label\" to describe his or her plight, but the Tribunal can only deal with the claims actually made.\n His Honour, in our view, correctly stated the position when he said at (at [18]): \n 'The question, ultimately, is whether the case put by the appellant before the tribunal has sufficiently raised the relevant issue that the tribunal should have dealt with it.\n24 The Full Court further said, at [63]:\n It is plain enough, in the light of Dranichnikov, that a failure by the Tribunal to deal with a claim raised by the evidence and the contentions before it which, if resolved in one way, would or could be dispositive of the review, can constitute a failure of procedural fairness or a failure to conduct the review required by the Act and thereby a jurisdictional error.\nIt follows that if the Tribunal makes an error of fact in misunderstanding or misconstruing a claim advanced by the applicant and bases its conclusion in whole or in part upon the claim so misunderstood or misconstrued its error is tantamount to a failure to consider the claim and on that basis can constitute jurisdictional error.\nThe same may be true if a claim is raised by the evidence, albeit not expressly by the applicant, and is misunderstood or misconstrued by the Tribunal.\nEvery case must be considered according to its own circumstances.\nError of fact, although amounting to misconstruction of an applicant's claim, may be of no consequence to the outcome.\nIt may be \"subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which [the] contention rests which has been rejected\": Applicant WAEE [ WAEE v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 184] (at [47]).\n If the tribunal fails to consider a contention that the applicant fears persecution for a particular reason which, if accepted, would justify concluding that the applicant has satisfied the relevant criterion, and if that contention is supported by probative material, the tribunal will have failed in the discharge of its duty, imposed by s 414 to conduct a review of the decision.\nThis is a matter of substance, not a matter of the form of the tribunal's published reasons for decision.\n25 In WAEE , the Full Court said, at [47]:\n The inference that the tribunal has failed to consider an issue may be drawn from its failure to expressly deal with that issue in its reasons.\nBut that is an inference not too readily to be drawn where the reasons are otherwise comprehensive and the issue has at least been identified at some point.\nIt may be that it is unnecessary to make a finding on a particular matter because it is subsumed in findings of greater generality or because there is a factual premise upon which a contention rests which has been rejected.\nWhere, however, there is an issue raised by the evidence advanced on behalf of an applicant and contentions made by the applicant and that issue, if resolved one way, would be dispositive of the tribunal's review of the delegate's decision, a failure to deal with it in the published reasons may raise a strong inference that it has been overlooked.\n26 It may be, as Counsel for the Minister submitted, that the findings and reasons were, and were meant to be, applicable to all of the bases which the appellant had advanced.\n27 The fact remains, however, that there is an express and confining reference to ethnicity, both at the start and end of the Tribunal's \"Findings and Reasons\".\n28 It may very well be that the reasons which the Tribunal gave for declining the appellant's ethnicity as the foundation of an entitlement to be recognised as a refugee would also apply to the alternative bases advanced.\nThe Tribunal did not say so.\n29 In my judgment, there has been a failure to conduct the review required by the Act, and thereby the Tribunal erred in the exercise of the jurisdiction committed to it.\nI do not think that the findings of the Tribunal, expressly addressing the ethnicity claim, can be read as of general application to the other claims advanced by the appellant.\nThese other claims were not expressly addressed by the Tribunal in its reasons.\n30 The appellant advanced a further ground seeking to impugn the decision of the Tribunal and consequently the decision of the Federal Magistrate.\n31 It was submitted that the Tribunal had used information contained from a \"passenger movement\" file in the departmental file.\nIt was said that the finding as to the applicant's credibility and the reliance on an earlier trip in 2003 was \"part of the decision\", and pursuant to s 424A of the Act, the Tribunal was obliged to give notice to the applicant particulars of that information.\n32 It is plain from the passages of the transcript of the hearing earlier set out in these reasons that the Tribunal, in its oral hearing, made it plain to the appellant that the information about the time that he has had his passport, and his earlier visits to Australia, were relevant to its decision.\nThere was, on the material before the Court, no breach of s 424A of the Act.\n33 However, for the reason that the Tribunal failed to accord to the appellant the hearing and determination to which he was entitled, namely a proper consideration of the grounds on which he claimed to be a refugee, the appeal must be allowed.\n34 The orders of the Court are: Orders 2 and 3 of the decision of the Federal Magistrates Court of 2 March 2007 be set aside, and there be no order as to the costs before the Federal Magistrate.\n35 The decision of the Tribunal is set aside and the matter remitted to the Refugee Review Tribunal to be dealt with according to law.\n36 The first respondent is ordered to pay the appellant's costs of and incidental to the appeal.\nI certify that the preceding thirty-six (36) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Spender.\nDated: 31 May 2007\n Counsel for the Appellant: Mr A Kumar (directly instructed by the Appellant) \n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr D Godwin \n

        "description": "1 This is an appeal from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate on 13 April 2006 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal (the Tribunal) of 11 October 2005 and handed down on 3 November 2005.\nThe Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the first respondent to refuse to grant a protection visa to the first appellant.\n2 The Tribunal, differently constituted, had previously affirmed a delegate's decision on 23 December 2003 and an application for judicial review of the Tribunal's earlier decision was dismissed by Federal Magistrate Smith on 30 March 2005.\nThe appellants appealed that decision to the Federal Court and Sackville J made orders by consent on 9 June 2005 to remit the application to the Tribunal.\nThe matter before this Court is whether the Federal Magistrate was right in dismissing the appellants' application for judicial review of the second Tribunal's decision.\n3 The appellants are a married couple and their two children.\nThey are citizens of India.\nOnly the first appellant has made claims under the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, 1951 and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, 1967 (the Convention).\n4 Before the Tribunal the first appellant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution because of his political opinion.\nThe first appellant claimed to have been an active member of the Akali Dal (Mann) Party and to have been a branch level president.\nHis claims also involved threats by the Congress Party including being detained, being tortured and having false charges laid against him.\n5 The Tribunal considered the first appellant's claims but could not find any supporting evidence to suggest the Congress Party or the police harmed Akali Dal (Mann) members.\nHowever, the Tribunal's decision was based on a finding that the first appellant was not a witness of truth as there were inconsistencies in the first appellant's evidence, including inconsistencies with evidence in the protection visa application.\nThe Tribunal sent a letter pursuant to s 424A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act) setting out the inconsistencies.\nThe first appellant did not respond.\nThe Tribunal placed no weight on the letters and medical report submitted by the first appellant because it found the evidence was implausible.\nConsequently, the Tribunal found the first appellant was not a member of the Akali Dal or that he had political opinions imputed against him and therefore did not suffer Convention related harm.\nThe Tribunal also stated that the Convention looked to the future and considered the reasonable willingness of the Indian authorities to take action against criminal acts.\n6 The appellants sought judicial review of the Tribunal's decision before the Federal Magistrates Court on grounds that there was jurisdictional error in the Tribunal's decision and provided three bases for their claims.\n7 The appellants claimed that there was an 'over reliance' on the factual findings of the previous Tribunal and thus the second Tribunal failed to perform its duty under ss 414 and 415 of the Act.\nThe Federal Magistrate found that although the Tribunal did set out certain evidence from the earlier Tribunal, the second Tribunal's findings and reasons were concluded from an independent process and consideration of the evidence.\n8 The appellants claimed the Tribunal misconceived the finding regarding harassment of Akali Dal (Mann) members and referred to the Tribunal's inconsistent use of information from the first appellant's country or origin.\nIn particular they contended the finding that there was no independent evidence to suggest members of the Akali Dal party were harmed by the authorities was inconsistent with a finding that there were complaints received by the Director General of Police in Punjab.\nThe Federal Magistrate considered, in view of the evidence that the Sikh Militant Movement was no longer active, that implicit in the Tribunal's finding was that the victims of the complaints were not members of the Akali Dal.\nThe Federal Magistrate held that whether or not the factual conclusion was correct was not a matter for judicial review.\n9 In relation to the appellants' claim that the Tribunal failed to assess the first appellant's claim of being a member of the Akali Dal, the Federal Magistrate found the Tribunal had considered it because the Tribunal did not accept the first appellant was a witness of truth and thus not a member of Akali Dal.\nThere was no obligation on the Tribunal to explore membership of a party of which the Tribunal was not satisfied the first appellant was a member.\nThe appellants' counsel submitted in support of this ground that s 65 of the Act only applied to the delegate and that it was s 414 of the Act that applied to the Tribunal.\nThe Federal Magistrate noted that s 415 of the Act brought s 65 into consideration when the Tribunal exercises its power of review under s 414 of the Act.\n10 Furthermore there was evidence for the Tribunal to make a finding of fact as to the first appellant's credibility.\nThe Federal Magistrate found no jurisdictional error and dismissed the application.\n11 The notice of appeal raised two grounds which re-raise the issues before the Federal Magistrate.\nFirstly, that the Federal Magistrate failed to deal properly with the Tribunal's non-compliance with s 414 of the Act by its overt reliance on the factual findings of the previous Tribunal and failure to assess the appellants' real claims.\nSecondly, the Federal Magistrate failed to consider whether the Tribunal made a jurisdictional error by its failure to assess the first appellant's claims in a 'constructive manner' regarding his membership of the Akali Dal (Mann) Party.\n12 The nub of the appellants' submissions on each ground is that by repeating the findings of the first Tribunal at a portion of its reasons, the second Tribunal was prejudiced into finding the first appellant was not credible and therefore it did not properly consider the issue of the first appellant's claimed membership of the Akali Dal (Mann) Party.\nThat is, that the second Tribunal was influenced by that adoption of a portion of the reasons of the first Tribunal into failing to consider the merits of the first appellant's claims as it is required to do by the Act.\n13 In support of this submission the appellants relied upon the dicta of the Full Court in NABE v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (No 2) [2004] FCAFC 263 ; (2004) 144 FCR 1 at 20 to the effect that a failure by a tribunal to deal with a claim raised by the evidence, which would or could be dispositive of the review, can constitute a failure of procedural fairness or a failure to conduct the review and may amount to a jurisdictional error.\n 'There is nothing in the Act to suggest that the Tribunal is bound in some way by conclusions reached in previous decisions.\nIndeed the Act, and in particular s 420 , requires that the Tribunal must act in accordance with the merits of the case.\nAs the Full Court explained in Sellamuthu v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1999] FCA 247 ; (1999) 90 FCR 287 the nature of the Tribunal's task in reviewing a decision requires a consideration of all available evidence.\nIn performing that task, the Tribunal cannot, in principle, be constrained by what it had decided in earlier cases.\nAdditionally reliance was placed by the appellants on NANX v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (2003) FCA 734 at [13] where Gyles J cites Collins v Minister for Immigration (1981) 36 ALR 598 at 602-603 in which the Full Court said that a tribunal is not required to take into account the factual findings of a previous tribunal; as authority for the proposition that over reliance on such previous findings of fact by the deciding tribunal may very well amount to the taking into account of an irrelevant consideration.\n 14 Before returning to the Federal Magistrate's reasoning on these issues, I turn to the nature of the evidence which was repeated.\nIt appears in 14 paragraphs of the reasons of the second Tribunal.\nThese paragraphs are explicative of, firstly, the claims made by the first appellant and, secondly, what occurred at the hearing of the first Tribunal in terms of issues raised by the Tribunal and put to the first appellant.\nThe paragraphs do not state the findings of the first Tribunal.\n15 It is apparent that the paragraphs are utilised for the purpose of explaining the development of the application.\nThey are not on the face of the reasons the source of any findings.\nThey have not had any constraining effect upon the second Tribunal in their terms.\nThere is nothing in the reasons of the second Tribunal to establish that over reliance has been placed upon them.\n16 However, the appellants contend that even if that is the case, the very fact that those paragraphs show that the first Tribunal put issues to the first appellant and stated they were linked with his credibility, should be seen as having been enough to prejudice the mind of the member of the second Tribunal and to have set him off on consideration of the first appellant's credibility.\nIn making this submission the appellants expressly abjure any allegation of bias on the part of the Tribunal members.\n17 There is no authority either statutory or at common law, requiring a second or subsequent tribunal to be isolated from the history of an application; that is, not to have evidence of prior hearings, appeals and references for rehearing.\nTo the contrary, references for rehearing may identify the source of errors in the reasoning of the previous tribunal and so require reference by the second or subsequent tribunal to that reasoning.\n18 Furthermore, the manner in which the reasons of the second Tribunal are expressed on the issue of credibility expressly disclose the foundations of the adverse credibility finding as lying in issues arising from the evidence.\nSix reasons are listed though arguably seven are given.\nIn those circumstances there is absolutely no basis upon which to infer that prejudice arising from the references to what occurred before the prior Tribunal where in any way a source of the focus by the second Tribunal upon the first appellant's credibility.\nThe inconsistencies arising in the evidence led the second Tribunal naturally to the issues of his credibility.\nIt did not fail to deal, and did in fact comprehensively deal with the issue of the first appellant's credibility.\n19 Having considered these contentions I am therefore in entire agreement with the reasoning of the Federal Magistrate that the ground does not give rise to any jurisdictional error.\n20 In relation to the second ground of appeal, the appellants contend that the error of the Tribunal was that it relied upon irrelevant material ( Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58 ; (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 179), being the paragraphs copied from the reasons of the first Tribunal.\nI have already said that the material was not irrelevant; it was a relevant part of the history of the appellants' application.\n21 Nevertheless, the appellants put the same matter another way by contending that the first appellant's legitimate expectations based on a statute cannot be excluded except by plain words of necessary intendment --- Annetts v McCann [1990] HCA 57 ; (1990) 170 CLR 596 at 598 per Mason CJ, Deane and McHugh JJ).\nThe legitimate expectation relied upon is that in making the claim under the Convention the first appellant was entitled to expect that he would be given the benefit of the doubt in deciding the issues in his application: Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining the Status of Refugees [196] and [203] (the Handbook).\n22 The Handbook and Convention are both not statutes of the Commonwealth Government and cannot of themselves give rise to any expectations.\n 'I regard the Handbook more as a practical guide for the use of those who are required to determine whether or not a person is a refugee than as a document purporting to interpret the meaning of the relevant parts of the Convention.\n 23 The Federal Magistrate concluded that the second Tribunal's rejection of the first appellant's claim of membership of the Akali Dal party followed from that Tribunal's finding that his evidence lacked credibility.\nThat was a finding within the province of the Tribunal.\nIt was entitled to reach that conclusion.\nThere is nothing in what the appellants now submit that would make out that the Tribunal in taking that view was in error of law.\n24 It follows that the appeal must be dismissed.\n I certify that the preceding twenty-four (24) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of

        "description": "Edited from Transcript \n 1 The plaintiff, liquidator for Parle Foods Pty Limited ACN 050 213 468 (in Liquidation) (Receivers and Managers Appointed) (\"the company\"), has commenced proceedings in the present matter and in 38 other proceedings, claiming that the various defendants received amounts as \"unfair preferences\" as defined by section 588FA of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)\n2 The plaintiff seeks leave under Order 6 Rule 2(b) of the Federal Court Rules to join the various defendants as defendants in matter NSD 439 of 2006.\n3 The defendants are in some cases national corporations but others are smaller firms or companies.\nThe defendants include the Commonwealth of Australia.\n4 The company carried on business mainly in Griffith and many of the defendants are located in the Griffith area.\nA number of defendants are from interstate.\nThe claims when grouped for each defendant range from just under $10,000 to, in one case, over $3 million.\n5 The plaintiff filed an interlocutory originating process in matter NSD439 of 2006 on 6 March 2006, seeking an order under Order 6 Rule 2, that the plaintiff have leave to join in the proceedings all of the 38 defendants listed in the schedule to the originating process which was filed on the same day.\n6 The plaintiff accepts that Order 6 Rule 2(a)(ii) has not been met because the claims do not arise out of the same transaction or series of transactions.\nLeave is therefore required under order 6 rule 2(b).\n7 Since the proceedings have already been commenced, leave is required nunc pro tunc.\n8 Mr Taylor SC appears for the first defendant.\nMr J.T.\nJohnson appears for 13 of the defendants.\nThey oppose leave.\n9 The plaintiff relies on the test stated by Austin J in Dean-Willcocks v Air Transit International Pty Limited [2002] NSWSC 525 ; (2002) 55 NSWLR 64 (\" Dean-Willcocks\") , in particular, at [34].\nMr Taylor and Mr Johnson accept that this is the correct approach although they say that the case is distinguishable from the present proceedings.\n10 Austin J said at [34] in Dean-Willcocks that the court's task is to identify and weigh the advantages and disadvantages to the plaintiff and the defendants as a whole, and in terms of the efficient use of the court's resources, having regard to the commonality of issues raised by each claim and the court's ability to case manage the proceedings so as to minimise disadvantages.\n11 His Honour said at [35] that there are some special features of unfair preference proceedings which may justify the grant of leave even though leave would not be granted in similarly constituted proceedings which have a different subject matter.\nIt is unnecessary to repeat the three considerations to which his Honour referred at [35].\n12 The approach adopted by Austin J was followed by Young CJ in Eq in Gloria Marshall Australia Pty Limited (in liq) v Bell Press Pty Limited [2002] NSWSC 1191.\nHis Honour considered that the best way of dealing with the matter was to apply a common sense approach to the issue.\nI respectfully follow what was said by Austin J and by the Chief Judge in Equity as guiding the exercise of my discretion in the present case.\n13 The present proceedings are at a very early stage.\nThe \"consolidated\" proceeding and the 38 separate proceedings were commenced close to the expiration of the limitation period.\nThe plaintiff proposes to discontinue against seven of the defendants, leaving 31 in the consolidated proceeding or 31 separate actions if I refuse leave in matter NSD439 of 2006.\n14 The submissions of Mr Taylor and Mr Johnson are that there ought to be 31 separate proceedings rather than one consolidated action.\nThey submit that many of the factors which were present in Dean-Willcocks are not applicable to the present proceeding.\nThe principle matters to which they point are fourfold.\n15 Firstly, they say that separate proceedings have already been commenced in this court and that those proceedings can be case managed, so it is submitted, just as efficiently as one consolidated action.\n16 Secondly, they submit that the question of insolvency can be determined in the separate proceedings in a way which will bind all of the defendants.\n17 Third, they point out that there is no evidence of the plaintiff's prospects of success.\n18 Fourth, counsel submit that the evidence suggests that there will be no dividend for the unsecured creditors.\nThey say that such funds as are recovered will be subject to the liquidator's lien and therefore go towards payment of his fees rather than for the benefit of the unsecured creditors as a whole.\n19 I do not consider that any of the factors to which counsel for the various defendants pointed, displace the considerations to which Austin J referred at [35].\nIt seems to me that those considerations apply equally here notwithstanding the fact that there may be no recovery for the benefit of the body of unsecured creditors.\n20 As to that issue the proceedings are at an early stage and it would not seem possible to predict what the outcome may be.\nI am concerned that there is no evidence as to prospects of success but the short answer to all of the submissions of counsel for the defendants lies in the fact that there are separate proceedings already on foot.\nMr Mathas, for the plaintiff, accepts that if leave is given in matter NSD439 of 2006, the separate proceedings must be dismissed.\n21 Thus the question may be reduced to a very simple one.\nIs it more advantageous and efficient to have 31 separate cases or one consolidated action?\nIn my opinion it is plainly more efficient to have one proceeding.\nThe most important factor is the solvency issue.\nThat is to say, was the company insolvent at the time of the relevant transaction.\nThat issue is common to all cases although it is not yet known whether all of the defendants propose to put that issue in question.\n22 The plaintiff proposes to file a solvency report dealing with that issue.\nBy following the course proposed by the plaintiff I can case manage the proceedings to a point where the solvency issue has been determined.\nI have been told today that at least two of the defendants propose to put solvency in issue.\nEither the others do or they do not.\nOnce the question has been determined and once it emerges which defendants seek to put it in issue I can then decide to in effect deconsolidate the hearing by appropriate orders and directions for the hearing of the remaining issues, either in separate cases or in groups of cases.\n23 I have considered all of the other objections raised by Mr Taylor and Mr Johnson.\nIn my view none of the objections lead to a different result in weighing the advantages and disadvantages of proceeding in the manner which I propose.\n24 To the extent that any difficulties may arise in relation to the interlocutory stages of the proceedings such as discovery, if the parties cannot agree on the course I can deal with them by appropriate directions.\n25 In Dean-Willcocks, Austin J pointed out that one of the factors which justify the joinder of a number of defendants is the fact that the case management of the proceedings is allocated in the Supreme Court of New South Wales to the Corporations List.\nThat is a regular weekly list within which issues of this type are dealt with and their progress is monitored and dealt with expeditiously.\n26 There is a separate Corporations List in the Federal Court.\nA Corporations Duty Judge sits on Fridays at 9.30am to hear matters referred from a registrar.\nUrgent applications may be made directly, on any day of the week, to the rostered Corporations Duty Judge.\nAt present the Corporations Duty Judges are by rotation, Justices Emmett, Gyles, and Lindgren, although other members of the Court's Corporations Panel fill that role if one or other of those judges is not available.\nDetails of the Court's administrative arrangements for dealing with Corporations matters are contained in a notice to practitioners issued by the NSW District Registrar on 6 February 2006.\n27 I will myself case manage the present proceedings but in the event that something may arise at a time when I am not available, the matter could be dealt with by the Corporations Duty Judge who is sitting at that time to deal with urgent applications.\nThe matter can therefore be dealt with and managed in much the same way as matters are managed in the corporations list of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.\n28 It follows, as I have said, that if there are any real difficulties and the parties cannot agree, I will be able to deal with them by appropriate directions, or if for some reason I am not available, the issues can be dealt with promptly by the Corporations Duty Judge.\n29 I have considered the written submission of Mr Johnson that if the proceedings were to be dealt with by way of separate actions, Rule 2.13 of the Federal Court Corporations Rules could be utilised to enable interested persons to appear so as to enable relevant common issues such as the solvency issue to be determined.\nHowever, it does seem to me that the better course is the course which I propose to adopt, namely, that I will give leave as sought by the plaintiff, thereby enabling me to deal, hopefully efficiently and promptly, with all of the issues in the way that I have indicated.\n30 I therefore propose to make orders in terms of those proposed.\n31 Mr Johnson appeared for 13 defendants.\nHe undertook to ensure appearances are filed for all of them.\nAs at the date of publication of this judgment, appearances have not be filed for these defendants, other than the 18 th defendant.\nI certify that the preceding thirty-one (31) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice

        "description": "1 Ms Li is a citizen of the Peoples' Republic of China, who is ordinarily resident in Cambodia.\nOn 17 November 2006, Ms Li arrived at Melbourne airport as the holder of a subclass 676 (Tourist (Short Stay)) visa.\nShortly after her arrival, an officer of the respondent Minister's Department interviewed her.\nAs a result of that interview, the officer cancelled Ms Li's visa.\nMs Li issued a proceeding in the Federal Magistrates Court, claiming that the officer's decision was affected by jurisdictional error, including a denial of natural justice.\n2 Federal Magistrate Burchardt dismissed Ms Li's application.\nShe now appeals to this Court.\n &#8226; whether the officer denied Ms Li procedural fairness in conducting the interview at times without an interpreter; and\n &#8226; whether the Federal Magistrate denied Ms Li procedural fairness by refusing to admit evidence concerning the conduct of the interview.\n THE INTERVIEW \n 3 Ms Li arrived at the airport at about 9.30 am.\nHer interview with the officer appears to have commenced at about 10.45 am.\nThe interview proceeded without an interpreter, despite Ms Li not speaking English fluently.\nAs a result of discussions during which an interpreter was not present, the officer formed the view that Ms Li had told him that she had come to Australia to talk with her customers about a shipment of clothing which she had arranged to be sent to Australia.\nWhile this early part of the interview with Ms Li was not recorded, it is evident from comments the officer made later in the interview (shortly after 12.14pm when a Bahasa Indonesian interpreter was present and when recording of the interview had commenced) that he had formed this view during the part of the interview when an interpreter was not present.\n 'Ms Li, you've indicated to me that you have come to Australia to speak with some customers in order to see how a shipment had gone that arrived last week.\n The transcript records that the interpreter is present at this stage, but that Ms Li (as distinct from the interpreter) gives the non-responsive answer:\n '...I can speak English I think.\n 5 Shortly thereafter, the officer decided that a Mandarin interpreter would be more appropriate.\nAfter the Bahasa interpreter left the interview and before a Mandarin interpreter became available by telephone, the officer continued the interview without an interpreter.\n 'OFFICER: Okay.\nWe need to make sure why you come to Australia.\n MS LI: I come I sell clothes, customer.\n OFFICER: Sell clothes to customer?\n MS LI: Yes.\n 6 The officer then questioned Ms Li about her business activities and sightseeing last time she visited Australia.\nMs Li is recorded as saying that she was in Australia for 10 days last time and that she saw customers for two days.\nThe officer appears to later confuse that evidence with her intentions on her current visit.\nThe discussion continued by reference to a container of clothes which was on its way to Australia and would be picked up by her 'customer', Mr Patterson, in the week after her arrival.\n 'OFFICER: You come to Australia this time for business?\n MS LI: Yeah.\n ... \n OFFICER: Other reason for coming to Australia.\n MS LI: Yeah, just... \n OFFICER: Just business.\n MS LI: Yeah, just business, okay, just a couple months.\nI bring money, go back.\n 8 At about 1.15 pm, again without an interpreter, the officer commenced to read a notice of intention to consider the cancellation of Ms Li's visa.\nDuring the course of reading that notice, a Mandarin interpreter became available and the officer re-read the notice, which the interpreter translated to Ms Li.\n 'I'm just explaining to her, and if you can repeat this, it has come to the department's attention that there may be grounds for cancellation of your visa under section 116 of the Migration Act for the following reasons, okay.\nThe reasons are you have made admissions that you have come to Australia for the purpose of conducting business.\nTherefore, you have ceased to have an intention only to visit or remain in Australia as a visitor temporarily for the purpose of visiting an Australian citizen.\n 10 The officer went on to inform Ms Li that he would conduct an interview at 1.30 pm that day to give her an opportunity to give reasons why her visitor's visa should not be cancelled.\n11 It appears that by this stage the officer had formed a preliminary view based on comments made by Ms Li, without the assistance of an interpreter, that Ms Li had come to Australia, in part, to conduct business.\n12 At 1.40 pm, while a Mandarin interpreter was present, the officer asked Ms Li to provide reasons why the grounds for cancellation do not exist.\nMs Li replied to the effect that she came to Australia for a holiday and to collect money for clothes that she had previously sold.\nShe later said that she intended to do some sightseeing and collect money.\n '...Because I am carrying many things for many people this time, mainly the things my customers asked me to buy for them in Cambodia.\n 13 Shortly thereafter, at p 23 of the transcript, the officer said that he had decided to cancel the visa 'under s 116(1)(g) and regulation 2.43(1)(j) ', as 'Ms Li has come to Australia for the intention of conducting business'.\n THE LEGISLATIVE CONTEXT \n 14 Section 116(1)(g) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('Act') provides:\n 'Subject to sub-sections (2) and (3), the Minister may cancel a visa if he or she is satisfied that: \n ... \n (g) a prescribed ground for cancelling a visa applies to the holder; \n ...' \n 15 Regulation 2.43(1) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) provides: \n 'For the purposes of paragraph 116(1)(g) of the Act...the grounds prescribed are: \n ... \n (j) in the case of the holder of: \n ... \n (ii) a Subclass 676 (Tourist (Short Stay)) visa; \n ... \n that, despite the grant of the visa, the Minister is satisfied that the visa holder did not have, at the time of the grant of the visa, or has ceased to have, an intention only to visit, or remain in, Australia as a visitor temporarily for the purpose of visiting an Australian citizen...or for another purpose, other than a purpose related to business or medical treatment; \n ...' \n 16 Section 119(1) of the Act provides: \n '...if the Minister is considering cancelling a visa...under section 116 , the Minister must notify the holder that there appear to be grounds for cancelling it and: \n (a) give particulars of those grounds and of the information...because of which the grounds appear to exist; and \n (b) invite the holder to show within a specified time that: \n (i) those grounds do not exist; or \n (ii) there is a reason why it should not be cancelled.\n MS LI'S CONTENTIONS ON THE INTERVIEW \n 17 Ms Li's counsel noted that the answers given by Ms Li from 1.40 pm onwards when an appropriate interpreter was present at the interview reinforce the officer's view formed earlier (when an appropriate interpreter was not present) that Ms Li came to Australia to conduct business.\nHowever, counsel submitted that the lack of appropriate interpretation earlier in the interview 'irretrievably poisoned the well' and affected the officer's view of Ms Li's credibility.\nCounsel contended that the officer denied Ms Li a fair opportunity to put her case during the period prior to when he had formed the view that there may be grounds for cancelling her visa.\nCounsel submitted that the officer denied Ms Li procedural fairness in the manner in which he conducted the interview.\n PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS \n 18 The information obtained by the officer, on which he considered that there may be grounds for cancelling Ms Li's visa, was obtained from Ms Li in the absence of a proper translation of the communications between them.\nHowever, the officer had the benefit of an interpreter when he informed Ms Li that there may be grounds for cancelling her visa.\nHe afforded her an opportunity, with the assistance of an appropriate interpreter, to inform him why her visa should not be cancelled.\nDuring that part of the interview, Ms Li told the officer that she intended to collect money from customers during her stay, for the clothes she had previously sold.\nIn effect, Ms Li said that she intended to conduct some business by collecting money from customers and to also have a holiday.\nShe thereby exhibited a mixed purpose.\nIn the circumstances, no practical injustice arose (see Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs; Ex parte Lam [2003] HCA 6 ; (2003) 195 ALR 502 at [37] ).\n19 Although the officer inappropriately obtained some information from Ms Li without proper interpreting facilities, he afforded her an opportunity to disabuse him from any prima facie views he had formed as a result of those discussions.\nThe oral notice issued under s 119 of the Act was interpreted properly.\nThe answers given to it were interpreted.\nIn those answers, Ms Li stated that she came to Australia for a holiday and the purpose of collecting money from customers.\nNo practical injustice arose as a consequence of the failure of the officer to afford adequate interpretation prior to the reading of the notification under s 119 of the Act.\nMs Li stated, with the assistance of interpretation, that she came for a mixed purpose.\nOn the basis of these statements, the officer was entitled to cancel her visa.\n REFUSAL TO ADMIT AFFIDAVIT EVIDENCE \n 20 Ms Li sought to tender before the Federal Magistrate affidavit evidence about the conditions and conduct of the interview and about her lack of understanding of the officer's questions, absent an interpreter.\nEven if this evidence had have been admitted it would not have demonstrated any injustice which was not remedied by proper interpretation of the notification under s 119 of the Act and proper interpretation of the subsequent interview which commenced at 1.40 pm.\nAssuming, without deciding, that this evidence should have been admitted, its tender would not have affected the conclusion that, overall, there was no practical injustice visited upon Ms Li.\nIn her affidavit, Ms Li seeks to contradict what her counsel agreed was an accurate interpretation of what she said in the interview when assisted by a Mandarin interpreter.\nThis shows that little weight would have been given to the affidavit if it had been admitted.\n ORDER \n 21 The appeal must be dismissed, with costs.\nThe appellant sought the costs of an application for interlocutory relief preventing her removal pending the appeal.\nI see no reason why this circumstance should mean any extraordinary situation thereby arose such that costs should not follow the event.\n I certify that the preceding twenty-one (21) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.\nDated: 2 March 2007\n Counsel for the Appellant: Mr J Gibson \n Solicitors for the Appellant: Hymans Solicitors \n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr G Livermore \n Solicitor for the Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor \n Date of Hearing: 2 March 2007 \n Date of Judgment: 2 March 2007 \n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \n URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2007/266.html"

        "description": "1 This morning, after hearing the submissions of counsel for the appellant and some brief submissions from counsel for the first respondent to which counsel for the appellant had an opportunity to reply, the Court informed the parties that it did not wish to hear further from counsel for the first respondent.\nThe Court ordered that the appeal be dismissed with costs and said that it would publish its reasons at 2.30 pm today.\nWhat follows are my reasons for the making of those orders.\n2 The appellant, Jia Da Shen, is aggrieved by the decision of a delegate of the respondent Minister to cancel his student visa.\nHe applied to the Migration Review Tribunal for a merits review of the decision but the Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision.\nThe appellant then sought judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal but the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed that application.\nHe now appeals to this Court.\n 1.\nDid the Tribunal ask itself the wrong question in deciding a factual matter adversely to the appellant concerning his attendance during contact hours at school?\n2.\nWas the Tribunal able to rely on grounds for cancellation other than the one originally identified to the appellant by the Minster's delegate?\n3.\nWas the validity of the cancellation affected by technical problems with the notice sent to him under the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth)?\n4.\nWas the appellant denied natural justice?\n Background \n4 The appellant is a citizen of China.\nHe came to Australia in August 2001 as the holder of a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) Visa, subclass 560.\nThe visa had an expiry date of 15 March 2004.\n5 The appellant enrolled in a course of secondary education at Eltham College for the academic years 2002 and 2003.\n6 Semester 1 in 2003 commenced on 3 February 2003 and concluded on 27 June 2003.\n7 On 4 June 2003, Eltham College sent the appellant a notice under s 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth).\nThe s 20 notice advised the appellant, amongst other things, that he had breached a condition of his student visa relating to course attendance requirements.\n8 In response to the s 20 notice, the appellant attended the office of the respondent Minister's department in Lonsdale Street, Melbourne on 23 June 2003.\nOn that day, a departmental officer handed him a \" Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation \" under s 116 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).\n \"You have been reported by Eltham College on 4/6/03 that you have been absent for 19 out of 43 classes for maths.\nAbsent for SAC on 29/5/03.\nAbsent for Further Methods for 26 out of 46 classes.\nHas not submitted 4 assessment tasks.\nESL --- absent for 6 lessons and 30 minutes late on 2 occasions.\nPhysics --- missed at least 4 lessons and absent for Physics SAC.\nPossible breach of 8202 condition.\n10 The reference to \"8202 condition\" was one to condition 8202 to the student visa, referred to at r 2.43(2)(b) of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth).\n (1) The holder...must meet the requirements of subclasses (2) and (3).\n (2) A holder meets the requirements of his subclause if: \n ... \n (b) in the case of the holder of Subclass 560 ... visa who is an exchange student - the holder is enrolled in a full-time course of study... \n 3.\n (a) in the case of a holder whose education provider keeps attendance records --- the Minister is satisfied that the holder attends for at least 80% of the contact hours scheduled: \n ... \n (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester --- for each term and semester of the course; and \n (b) in any case --- the holder achieves an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be at least satisfactory: \n ... \n (ii) for a course that runs for at least a semester --- for each term or semester (whichever is shorter) of the course.\n ...\" \n11 On 3 October 2003, an officer of the department provided the appellant with a further s 116 notice.\n \"Visa holder has been previously notified of an intention to consider cancelling his visa on 23/6/03 for a breach of visa condition 8202 due to poor attendance at Eltham College.\nThe notification is still valid but non-enrolment has also been added for the client as he has no current enrolment.\nBreach of visa condition 8202.\n12 Earlier in June 2003, Eltham College had notified the department that the appellant was not enrolled at the College as at 11 June 2003, as the appellant had left school on 10 June 2003.\n13 After interviewing the appellant on 3 October 2003, the delegate cancelled the visa under s 116(1)(b) and (3) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).\nUnder those provisions, the Minister may cancel a visa if the holder has not complied with a condition of it and must do so if there exist prescribed circumstances in which a visa must be cancelled.\n &#8226; the appellant breached condition 8202(3)(a)(ii) by attending less that 80% of scheduled contact hours in Semester 1 of 2003; and\n &#8226; The appellant breached condition 8202(2)(b) by not being enrolled in a full time course of study in Semester 2 of 2003.\n15 On 6 October 2003, the appellant sought a review of the delegate's decision in the Tribunal.\nOn 22 March 2004, the Tribunal decided to affirm the decision under review.\n16 The Tribunal noted that the delegate calculated the appellant's attendance at his classes in Semester 1 of 2003 at 75%.\nIt also noted that the appellant left school on 10 June 2003 to transfer to another course due to commence on 30 June 2003.\nIt further observed that, on his own evidence, the appellant either did not enrol in that other course or had enrolled but did not pay fees.\n17 Before the Tribunal the appellant took issue with the accuracy of the attendance records provided by Eltham College.\nThe Tribunal found that it had \"no reason to believe that the attendance records provided by Eltham College are other than an accurate record.\n\" It considered that the appellant had not met condition 8203(3)(a).\nIt also said that condition 8203(3)(b) had not been met as the College had not certified that the appellant had achieved a satisfactory academic result.\nFurther, it found that the appellant had breached condition 8202(2) by not being engaged in full time study at any institution between 11 June 2003 and the cancellation of his visa on 3 October 2003.\n18 Federal Magistrate Phipps dismissed the application for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision on 10 November 2005.\n 1. the Tribunal did not consider whether the appellant had attended 80% of contact hours but rather looked at daily attendance records, thereby asking itself the wrong question; and\n 2. the Tribunal breached the rules of natural justice by not making its own inquiries about the attendance records.\n19 On the first issue, Phipps FM, referred to the judgment of Jacobson J in Quan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 764.\nIn Quan , the Court held that the Tribunal had asked itself the wrong question by not considering \"whether it had reached a state of satisfaction as to the contact hours attended\"; see Quan at [36].\n20 In Quan the attendance records related to only the total number of days at which Mr Quan attended at the school.\nThey bore no relation to what actually occurred during his attendance at school.\n21 The Federal Magistrate observed that the records from Eltham College were class attendance records and not daily attendance records as in Quan.\n \"The reasonable reading of them is that the tribunal considered that when the College records and other material showed that the [appellant] was absent from a class, that meant he missed the class, not that he was there for part of the class.\nTherefore, to calculate a percentage of classes attended was to calculate a percentage of contact hours attended.\n22 His Honour then noted the appellant's submission that the Tribunal had not taken into account other activities at the College in assessing attendance, such as School Assessed Coursework.\nHis Honour said that the Tribunal had evidence before it about attendance and determined, on that evidence, that the required percentage of contact hours was not attained.\nTherefore, he considered that the Tribunal did not ask itself the wrong question.\n23 The Federal Magistrate also dismissed the appellant's submissions based on natural justice and related grounds.\nHe said that the Tribunal was not obliged to search for evidence on the College's practice of recording lateness for class or the way attendance on medical practitioners affected attendance records.\n24 His Honour found, in any event, that the Tribunal had independent valid grounds for affirming the cancellation of the visa given the lack of certification of a satisfactory academic result and the failure of the appellant to be enrolled in full time study from 11 June 2003 until the cancellation of the visa.\n25 Counsel for the appellant took issue with his Honour's distinguishing of Quan .\nCounsel also said that the Tribunal was not able to rely on a breach of condition 8202(2)(b), or the condition relating to satisfactory academic performance, given that the s 20 notice only referred to attendance requirements.\nCounsel contended that reliance on these conditions by the Tribunal amounted to a denial of natural justice.\nIn his oral submissions, counsel contended that the Tribunal's reliance on the condition relating to satisfactory academic performance amounted to a breach of s 359A of the Act.\nCounsel also submitted that the Tribunal erred by considering whether the applicant was engaged in full time study, and not whether he was enrolled in a course.\nCounsel further submitted that the Tribunal erred by disregarding the effect of the alleged statement of the delegate that the applicant was not permitted to study in Australia.\n26 Counsel for the Minister submitted that \"contact hours\" in condition 8202 refers to the proportion of required contact hours attended by the student.\nHe said that there was no suggestion before the Tribunal that the length of classes varied from subject to subject.\nCounsel also agreed with the Court below that Quan was distinguishable.\n \"...was a case in which there was no inquiry made as to the number of classes attended, and the decision rested on a simplistic calculation based on the number of days the visa holder had not attended school.\n27 Counsel for the Minister calculated from the attendance records before the Tribunal that \"expressed as a proportion of the total number of classes the appellant was required to attend in term 1, [of 2003] his attendance was less that the required 80%\".\nCounsel also contended that there was no basis for the submission of the appellant that the attendance records did not properly reflect when he was late, as distinct from absent.\nCounsel drew attention to the appellant's failure to persuade the Tribunal that he had been marked as absent on two occasions when he had merely been late.\n28 Counsel for the Minister submitted that the s 20 notice did not act as precondition to the cancellation under s 116.\nHe also contended that the appellant could not have been taken by surprise by the findings that he was not enrolled in course of study and was not the beneficiary of certificate of satisfactory completion of study as each matter was an incontrovertible fact.\n The attendance issue \n29 Regulation 1.03 of the Migration Regulations defines \"contact hours\" as:\n \"for a course for a period, means the total number of hours in the period for which students enrolled in the course are scheduled to attend classes for teaching purposes, course-related information sessions, supervised study sessions and examinations.\n30 The records relied on by the Tribunal were attendance records for classes, school assessed coursework and examinations.\nThose records enabled an assessment of \"contact hours\" within the definition of those words in the regulations.\nThe Tribunal's calculation of the contact hours attended by the appellant was a question of fact for it to determine.\nUnlike in Quan , the Tribunal did consider whether it had reached a state of satisfaction as to contact hours attended.\nIt did not merely consider the total number of days attended as a proportion of the number of days in the term.\nNo judicially reviewable error arose as a result of the Tribunal's treatment of this issue.\n31 The Tribunal was entitled to consider the appellant's failure to be enrolled in full time study and his failure to achieve satisfactory academic results as grounds for visa cancellation, despite the s 20 notice not referring to these grounds.\n32 In Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Yu [2004] FCAFC 333 it was held, by majority, that s 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act does not limit the circumstances in which s 116 of the Migration Act might operate where condition 8202 has not been complied with by a visa holder.\n33 Consequently there was nothing stopping the Tribunal from relying on grounds other than the attendance record ground.\nNo breach of natural justice arose as a consequence because the facts giving rise to these breaches of condition 8202 were obvious and incontrovertible.\nThis is especially so where, as here, s 357A applied to the application for review such that general procedural fairness grounds of review were not open to the appellant in the Court below.\nAny allegation that s 359A of the Act was not complied with by the Tribunal, due to an alleged failure to raise with the appellant the College's lack of certification of satisfactory completion of his course, is met by the fact that the Tribunal had two other independent grounds for cancelling the visa.\nSee, by way of analogy in respect of s 424A, SZEEU v The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 2 at [160] per Weinberg J and [233] per Allsop J.\nIn other words, the failure of the Tribunal to inform the appellant that the visa could be cancelled as a consequence of a lack of certification of successful completion of his course did not affect the outcome of the review.\nFurthermore, the lack of certification was something so obvious that it need not have been stated and was a vital requirement for satisfaction of condition 8202.\n34 The appeal ground relating to the Tribunal's consideration of whether the applicant was engaged in study, rather than whether he was enrolled in a course, was not developed further in oral submissions before the Court.\nThe contention of the appellant that he was not so enrolled because the delegate allegedly told him not to enrol does not deny the fact of his non-enrolment.\nIn any event, this ground is, again, independent of the other grounds for cancellation of the visa, that is, failure to achieve satisfactory academic results and failure to meet the attendance requirements.\n35 As the s 20 notices in this matter suffered from the vices detected in Morsed v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 193 , I invited the parties to present written submissions dealing with that judgment.\n36 In Morsed , the appellant claimed that his breach of condition 8202 was due to exceptional circumstances beyond his control.\nNo such issue of circumstances beyond the control of the appellant is relevant here.\nOn that view alone, Morsed is distinguishable.\n37 In any event, the cancellation of the student visa in Morsed arose as a result of the automatic effect of s 137J of the Migration Act , consequent upon a s 20 notice.\nIt did not arise, as here, by virtue of the independent operation of s 116 of the Migration Act .\n38 Having regard to the foregoing I dismissed the appeal, with costs.\n I certify that the preceding thirty-eight (38) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.\nDated: 12

        "description": "1 The appellant appeals from a judgment of the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia which dismissed his application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal.\nThe Tribunal had dismissed an application by the appellant for a review of the rejection of his application for a protection visa.\nThe notice of appeal originally listed the Tribunal as the only respondent.\nAt the hearing of the appeal, the Court gave leave for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to be added as a respondent to the appeal.\n2 The appellant represented himself before the Court below.\nHis grounds of review were generally unparticularised and sought to cavil with matters of merit determined by the Tribunal.\n3 One of two matters of substance dealt with by the Court below was the appellant's criticism of the Tribunal for proceeding to determine the matter in his absence.\nHe said that he did not receive the Tribunal's invitation to attend a hearing and was not informed of the hearing by his migration agent.\nThe problem about that submission was that the Tribunal received an acceptance, in writing and purportedly signed by the appellant, of a written offer from the Tribunal to attend a hearing before it.\n4 Her Honour, Emmett FM, held that, given the appellant was in regular contact with his migration agent until at least May 2000, it is unlikely that the agent would not have informed him of the hearing scheduled for 11 March 1999.\nHowever, her Honour said that the Tribunal should have attempted to contact the migration agent by telephone when the appellant failed to appear, given that he had earlier requested an oral hearing.\nBy proceeding without allowing the appellant to fully explain his claims, her Honour considered the Tribunal denied him procedural fairness.\nThis ordinarily would, according to her Honour, have led the Court below to find that a jurisdictional error had occurred.\n5 Her Honour then considered, notwithstanding her determination that a jurisdictional error had been committed by the Tribunal, whether she should refuse relief based on the appellant's delay in bringing the proceeding.\n6 The Tribunal's decision is dated 12 March 1999.\nThe appellant filed his application for judicial review on 13 July 2005, in excess of six years later.\nThe appellant contended before her Honour that he made inquiries with his migration agent about the fate of his review application, without success, until about May 2000.\nThe appellant said that he did not contact the Minister's Department about the fate of his application because he did not know its telephone number and that he had been told by his migration agent to wait for the decision.\n7 Her Honour considered the appellant's delay in applying for judicial review of the Tribunal's decision was unjustified.\nShe exercised her discretion to decline to grant the appellant relief on account of that delay.\n8 In his appeal grounds the appellant takes no issue with her Honour's exercise of discretion but merely seeks to re-agitate the other matters raised at first instance.\nHowever, in his oral submissions, he said he had no idea what had happened to his review application.\nBut for the exercise of her Honour's discretion, because of the appellant's delay, the appellant would have succeeded before the Court below.\nThere would have been nothing for the appellant to gain by seeking to address matters other than delay.\nHowever, the Minister has filed a notice of contention dealing with the procedural fairness issue.\n9 In the circumstances, Emmett FM was entitled to exercise her discretion to decline relief on account of the appellant's long delay in applying to the Court below for judicial review.\nIt is entirely implausible that the appellant would not be able to locate the telephone number of the Minister's Department to enquire about the status of his application.\nHer Honour did not err in the exercise of her discretion.\nConsequently it is unnecessary to deal with the submission raised in the Minister's notice of contention that the appellant had not been denied procedural fairness.\n10 The appeal is dismissed with costs.\nI certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Marshall.\nDated: 31 October 2006\n The appellant appeared in person.\nCounsel for the second respondent: J.A.C.\n Solicitor for the second respondent: Australian Government Solicitor \n Date of Hearing: 31 October 2006 \n Date of Judgment: 31 October 2006 \n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \n URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2006/1410.html"

Remaining Relative (Subclass 835) visa to the appellant.\n3 The appellant and his wife are citizens of Fiji.\nThe appellant and his wife both entered Australia for the first time on 25 September 1995 on Tourist Short Stay visas.\nThey have since re-entered Australia on a number of occasions.\nRelevantly, they both entered Australia on 9 August 2001 and were granted a Subclass 773 (Border) visa which authorised their stay until 8 September 2001.\nOn 30 August 2001 they were granted a Subclass 010 (Bridging A) visa on the basis that they would make application for an Other Family (Residence) (Class BU) visa which has as one of its subclasses Remaining Relative (Subclass 835) visa.\n4 In order to satisfy the criteria for the grant of a remaining relative visa, the appellant had to satisfy the definition of 'remaining relative' in reg 1.15 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulations').\n '(1) An applicant for a visa is a remaining relative of another person who is an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen if the applicant satisfies the Minister that: \n (a) ... \n (b) ... \n (c) if the applicant or the applicant's spouse (if any) has an overseas near relative: \n (i) the applicant and the applicant's spouse (if any) usually reside in a country, not being Australia, that is different to the country in which that relative resides; and \n (ii) neither the applicant nor the applicant's spouse (if any) have had contact with that relative within a reasonable period before making the application; and \n (d) the applicant and the applicant's spouse (if any) together have not more than 3 overseas near relatives; and \n (e) ... \n (2) In this regulation: \n overseas near relative , in relation to an applicant, means a person who is: \n (a) a parent, brother, sister, step-parent, step-brother or step-sister of the applicant or of the applicant's spouse (if any); or \n (b) a child (including a step-child) of the applicant or of the applicant's spouse (if any), being a child who: \n (i) has turned 18 and is not a dependent child of the applicant or of the applicant's spouse (if any); or \n (ii) has not turned 18 and is not wholly or substantially in the daily care and control of the applicant or of the applicant's spouse (if any)-- \n other than a relative of that kind who: \n (c) is an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen; and \n (d) is usually resident in Australia.\n (3) For the purposes of paragraphs (1)(c) and (d), an overseas near relative is taken to reside in his or her last known country of residence unless the applicant satisfies the Minister that the relative resides in another country.\n 5 The appellant's application for the remaining relative visa was made on 29 August 2001.\nIn that application, the appellant disclosed that his parents were both deceased and his siblings were all resident in Australia.\nHe said that he and his wife had a child resident in Fiji.\n6 The application also stated that the appellant's wife's father was deceased and her mother 'never known'.\nA letter, under the letterhead of a migration agent, accompanied the application.\n 'As per the Regulation 1.15 (1) The visa applicant is a remaining relative of an Australian citizen (a) who is the brother of the applicant.\n(b) usualy (sic) resides in Australia.\nand (c)(i) has no other relative overseas.\n My client has lost both of his parents and all the brothers and sisters are Australian citizen.\n Spouse of my client has been raised by her Father as her Mother left her and her Father when she was only 3 months old.\nMrs. Hassan has never seen her mother or heard about her.\n At later stage she knew from her father that her parents were only in a defacto relationship and therefore her maternal Grandparents never accepted the relationship nor (sic) the child.\nThey arranged there (sic) daughters (sic) marriage with someone else and later stage Mrs. Hassan's Mother left Fiji with her new husband.\nShe has never tried to be in touch with her daughter.\n Mrs. Hassan has lost her father on 17 th June 1994.\n Mr. &amp; Mrs Hassan has (sic) only one child who is about fourteen years old and fully dependent on her parents.\n My client fulfills (sic) the requirements of the subclass as a Last remaining relative of the nominator.\n 7 Section 359A(1) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act') provides: \n '(1) Subject to subsection (2), the Tribunal must: \n (a) give to the applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; and \n (b) ensure, as far as is reasonably practicable, that the applicant understands why it is relevant to the review; and \n (c) invite the applicant to comment on it.\n 8 On 16 March 2004 the Tribunal wrote to the appellant, pursuant to that subsection, setting out information that the Tribunal considered would be the reason or part of the reason for affirming the decision under review.\n 'You are now invited to comment, in writing, on the following: \n &#9679; Information contained in Departmental file CLF2001/044431 indicates that you and your wife (the secondary visa applicant) were unable to demonstrate that you have no \"overseas near relatives\".\n &#9679; In a statement to the Department, you claimed among other things, that your wife (the secondary visa applicant) has had no contact with her mother (Nur Begum) because she (Nur Begum) abandoned your wife when she was only 3 months old and that \"no one has seen or heard about her ever since\", was mere speculation because you have not provided any documentary evidence to support this claim.\nAs you have not provided any documentary evidence that Nur Begum is living in another country nor she is still alive or otherwise, then you do not meet the requirements of Subregulation 1.15(3) which states that ... an overseas near relative is taken to reside in his or her last known country of residence unless the applicant satisfies the Minister that the relative resides in another country.\n&#9679; You also confirmed in a statement that your daughter (Zureen Nisha) is under your care but she lives in Fiji.\nIf this is the case, then your daughter (Zureen Nisha) is considered as your \"overseas near relative\" and that you are in regular contact with her.\nAs this is the case, you are unable to meet Subparagrap 1.15(1)(c)(ii) which provides that ... an applicant for a visa is a \"remaining relative\" of another person who is an Australian citizen, an Australian permanent resident or an eligible New Zealand citizen if the applicant satisfies the Minister that neither the applicant nor the applicant's spouse (if any) have had contact with that relative within a reasonable period before making the application.\n The above information is relevant to this review because, if true, may indicate that you and the secondary visa applicant may not meet the requirements of the visa you seek.\nIf Subregulation 1.15(3) and Subparagraph 1.15(1)(c)(ii) is not met, the Tribunal has no option but to affirm the Department's decision not to grant you the visa.\n 10 On 15 April 2004 the appellant replied to the Tribunal, restating his claim that his wife's mother had abandoned her and not been seen or heard from.\nHe also said that he had been making inquiries in Fiji and now believed his wife's mother to have passed away, and was in the process of obtaining a death certificate which would be forwarded to the Tribunal as soon as it was received.\n11 At a hearing of the Tribunal on 6 July 2004, the appellant provided the Tribunal with a death certificate for his wife's mother ('the death certificate').\nOn 28 July 2004 a registered migration agent acting on the appellant's behalf wrote to the Tribunal in response to the Tribunal's letter.\nThe agent made representations as to why the appellant's daughter should not be considered an overseas near relative and enclosed statutory declarations from relatives and friends of the appellant, who had taken money from the appellant to Fiji for the care of the appellant's daughter.\n12 On 3 August 2004, against pursuant to s 359A , the Tribunal wrote to the appellant.\nThe Tribunal stated that it had received information from the Registrar-General in Fiji that the death certificate was fraudulent, because it did not match any of the death records in the Registrar-General's office.\nThe Tribunal also stated that the Registrar-General had provided information that the appellant's wife's mother and father had five other children.\nThe Tribunal stated that these pieces of information were relevant because, if true, they would mean the appellant's wife had six overseas near relatives and thus could not fulfil the criteria in reg 1.15(1)(d) that the appellant and his wife together have no more than three overseas near relatives.\n13 On 13 October 2004 the appellant wrote to the Tribunal stating that he had relied upon a third party in Fiji to provide him with the death certificate.\n 'I understand that the Prime issue which needs to be addressed here is the copy of Ms Nur Begum's Death Certificate provided to the Tribunal during the hearing on 06 July 2004 which Tribunal believes has been obtained fraudulantly (sic).\nI wish to make the following comments in order to substantiate my claim and satisfy the Tribunal before I can ask that the matter be remitted Back to the Department.\n Please note that we have been residing in Australia since August 2001 and we have been desperately attempting to contact Ms Nur Begum with out any luck.\nAfter extensive Investigations (sic) and no results we decided to expand our investigations and it was revealed that she has expired which we thought was unfortunate and sad.\nI along with my lady wife did not ruled (sic) out the possibility that she may would (sic) have been deceased and asked one of our friend (sic) to enquire and he informed us that she has passed away, this was not sufficent (sic) for us to believe and we requested him to provide us with evidence to substantiate his claim and he sent us the \"death Certificate\" which is on file with the Tribunal.\nI want the tribunal to understand that we are in Australia far away from our home and it was virtually impossible for us to do anything.\nWe had only one choice and that is to rely upon the informations (sic) given to us by the third party.\n I would ask the Tribunal to please accept my brief submission and remit the matter back to Department of Immigration.\n Another issue in your letter that Ms Nur Begum had five Childrens (sic) whose names are listed in your letter dated 03 August 2004.\nIn response to this All I would like to say is that Ms Nur Begum is quite a common name and I have personally experienced so many peoples who had same name and Date of Birth even in Australia, therefore, I would ask the Tribunal to give a benefit of Doubt.\n Please Sympathetically Consider.\n 14 In its reasons, the Tribunal said: \n '24.\nThe evidence before the Tribunal indicates that the secondary visa applicant's mother is resident in Fiji and that the death certificate is a fraudulent document and the evidence of the Australian High Commission is that the secondary visa applicant's mother has five other children.\nThe Tribunal places greater weight on the evidence provided by the Australian consular investigations than the rebuttal evidence of the review applicant received by the Tribunal on 13 October 2004.\nThis evidence states that the review applicant had relied on the evidence of a third party pertaining to the obtainment of the death certificate and that the authenticity was not able to be verified due to the review applicant being in Australia.\nIn addition this (sic) the Tribunal does not place any weight on the assertion of the review applicant that Nur Begum is a common name and that it is just coincidental that this person had the same birthdate.\n 25.\nThe Tribunal accordingly finds that the secondary visa applicant is unable to meet the legislative definition of remaining relative as she has more than three overseas near relatives at time of application.\n 15 In his amended application to the Federal Magistrates Court filed on 31 May 2005, the first ground of review was that the Tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction.\nThis ground was particularised in several ways, including a failure to make further inquiries of the appellant; a failure to advise the appellant that it was unwilling to consider the 'additional evidence' provided by the appellant; making a decision without verifying whether the 'additional evidence' had merits; and failing to enquire further about the relationship (or lack thereof) between the appellant's wife and her mother.\nScarlett FM treated this ground as a failure to make further enquiries and held that it was clear that the Tribunal had made enquiries about the death certificate.\n16 The second ground of review was that the Tribunal erred in law.\nThis ground was also particularised in several ways; including a failure by the Tribunal to properly consider evidence of the abandonment of the appellant's wife by her mother; whether there was a break in their relationship; a failure to consider the appellant's response to the Tribunal; and a failure by the Tribunal to follow up the possibility of there being another person with the same name as the appellant's wife's mother.\nScarlett FM characterised this ground as 'largely a request for a merits review', which was not within the Federal Magistrates Court's jurisdiction.\n17 His Honour noted that a complaint that the Tribunal had not sent documents to the appellant's migration agent had no merit because the appellant's contact details with the Tribunal had never been changed to include the migration agent's details.\n18 In his notice of appeal on this proceeding, the appellant claims that the ground of appeal is that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction or constructively failed to exercise its jurisdiction under the Act.\n '1.\nThe Tribunal discounted and refused to give weight to evidence regarding another person by the same name.\n 2.\nThe Tribunal rejected or discounted claims and only verified issues which could have adverse effect.\n 3.\nThe Tribunal with evidence and forming the view that the documents falsified and bogus, then erred by not rejecting the matter on character grounds.\n 4.\nThe Tribunal further erred by making a decision on documents which the Tribunal had believed to be correct without attempting to verify Mohammad Hassan's claims and not rejecting on character grounds.\n 19 These four grounds of appeal, like the grounds seeking judicial review before the Federal Magistrate, raise no more than a claim for a merits review.\nThe grounds of appeal, including the particulars, do not articulate any error on the part of the Federal Magistrate.\nThe grounds relate to evidence upon which the Tribunal's decision was made.\nNone of the grounds indicate the possibility of jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.\nIt has not been suggested, nor could it be, that there was no evidence upon which the Tribunal could have relied for its decision.\nThe grounds of appeal do not claim that the Tribunal failed to comply with the procedures in the Act.\nIt was suggested on the appeal that the Tribunal had failed to comply with s 359A but, as I have pointed out in these reasons, that claim cannot be sustained.\nThe Tribunal clearly provided the information that the Tribunal considered would be the reason, or part of the reason, for affirming the decision which was under review before the Tribunal.\n20 Mr Hassan was unrepresented at the hearing of the appeal.\nHe raised only two matters.\nFirst, he pointed to two birth certificates in the Appeal Books which he said showed the unreliability of Fijian record keeping.\nThe birth certificates are not necessarily inaccurate.\nThere is nothing in the papers which demonstrate whether or not they are accurate.\nSecondly, he said all of his siblings were now living in Australia and he wanted to be with them.\nWhilst that is an important matter to Mr Hassan, unfortunately, it is not relevant to any issue on the appeal.\n21 In my opinion, no error has been demonstrated on the part of the Federal Magistrate or any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal.\n22 The appeal must be dismissed.\n I certify that the preceding twenty-two (22) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Lander.\nDated: 11 August 2006\n Counsel for the Appellant: The Appellant appeared in person \n Counsel for the First and Second Respondents: A McInerney \n Solicitor for the First and Second Respondents: Phillips Fox \n Date of Hearing: 9 August 2006 \n Date of Judgment: 11 August 2006 \n AustLII: Copyright

        "description": "1 The Appellant is a citizen of India.\n2 He arrived in Australia on 30 November 2000 and applied to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for a Protection (Class XA) Visa on 10 July 2001.\nA delegate refused that application on 25 February 2002 and an application for review was thereafter lodged with the Refugee Review Tribunal.\n3 The Tribunal affirmed the decision of the delegate but this decision of the Tribunal was set aside by a decision of the Federal Magistrate's Court on 12 May 2006.\n4 The present decision of the Tribunal, differently constituted, was signed on 25 October 2006 and again affirmed the delegate's decision.\nOn 6 March 2008 the Federal Magistrates Court dismissed an application seeking review of the decision of the reconstituted Tribunal: NBDV v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FMCA 309.\n5 The Appellant now appeals to this Court.\n(i) a failure on the part of the Tribunal to \" consider the Applicant's refugee claims in a constructive and articulate manner because of ... contradictory findings it made during the assessment of the claims \"; and \n(ii) a failure to comply with s 424A(1)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth).\nFor the same reasons as were provided by the learned Federal Magistrate, neither ground is made out and the appeal is dismissed.\n6 The Appellant appeared before this Court unrepresented, although he did have the assistance of an interpreter.\nPreviously filed with the Court were written submissions signed by the Appellant and dated 12 May 2008.\nINCONSISTENT OR CONTRADICTORY FINDINGS?\n7 The first finding made by the Tribunal and now relied upon by the Appellant in his Notice of Appeal is the following:\n \"The Tribunal accepts the Applicant may have been involved in humanitarian work through his temple and in association with Madho once he started working for him in 1984, however the Tribunal is not satisfied that he was committed to this work as he claimed given the inconsistencies in his evidence as to his involvement in these activities at various times.\"...\n \"The Tribunal is satisfied the Applicant has not worked for human rights in the past in either Bihar or the Punjab.\nIt accepts the Applicant may have assisted Sikh families through providing(aid) such as food or money through the temple and also his employer Madho, but it does not accept the Applicant actively worked for human rights over a period of 15 or more years.\"...\n8 As was the conclusion of the Federal Magistrate, it is not considered that there is any inconsistency as between these findings.\nThe former finding is a conclusion as to the Appellant's involvement in \" humanitarian work \" and a conclusion as to the extent of his commitment to that work.\nThe latter finding is a conclusion that the Appellant had not worked for \" human rights \" but that he \" may have \" provided assistance, and a conclusion as to the active work undertaken by the Appellant over a \" period of 15 or more years \".\n9 There is not considered to be any necessary inconsistency or contradiction as between those two findings.\n10 When considering the decision of an administrative tribunal, including the Refugee Review Tribunal, considerable caution must be exercised in construing the findings and reasons set forth in that decision: Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang [1996] HCA 6 ; (1996) 185 CLR 259 at 272 per Brennan CJ, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow JJ.\nThis approach has since been endorsed: SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [25] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 617 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ; Black v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] FCAFC 189 at [36] , [2007] FCAFC 189 ; 99 ALD 1 at 9.\n11 Not only is there no necessary inconsistency as between the two findings relied upon by the Appellant, it is further considered that the findings and reasons of the Tribunal -- when read in their entirety -- dispel any support for the asserted \" inconsistency \".\nThose findings and reasons thus draw a distinction as between what the Tribunal regarded as \" human rights work \" and \" charity or humanitarian work \".\nWhen that distinction emerges, the manner in which the Tribunal expressed itself in the two findings set forth in the Notice of Appeal becomes more readily apparent.\n The Tribunal does not accept the applicant was a human rights activist in India.\nIt has serious doubts the applicant was involved in working for human rights as he claimed given the number of inconsistencies in his evidence and general lack of credibility as a result.\n...\nThe Tribunal also found the applicant's evidence regarding the activities he engaged in as part of his \"human rights work\" was more accurately described as charity or humanitarian work.\nThe applicant's primary role, as described by him in the hearing, was to identify needy people requiring assistance in the form of food, money or finding employment.\nAlthough the applicant claimed he also helped Sikh families find their loved ones who had gone missing, the Tribunal found the applicant's evidence in relation to how he went about locating these missing people to be unconvincing.\nThe Tribunal does not accept getting information from his workers or friends and being on the lookout for these people demonstrated any real commitment to locating people who had been reported as missing by their loved ones.\nFor these reasons the Tribunal does not accept the applicant was active in working for human rights in India.\n...\nThe Tribunal accepts the applicant may have taken an interest in helping Sikhs in Bihar from the time of the riots in 1984 following the assassination of Mrs Gandhi and that he had provided assistance to poor Sikhs by distributing money, food and other provisions.\nHowever, the Tribunal is satisfied the applicant did not engage in any activities associated with human rights.\nNor does it accept the applicant experienced any difficulties because of his humanitarian work.\nWhatever support may have been provided to the Appellant's argument by reason of the distinction drawn by the Tribunal as between \" humanitarian work \" and work for \" human rights \" -- had that distinction remained unexplained -- that support is removed once the distinction is explained and understood.\n12 It is an impermissible course for an appellant to seize upon two findings made by the Tribunal and to thereafter attempt to weave a fabric of contradiction or inconsistency founded solely upon those findings and divorced from the balance of the reasoning process.\n13 To construe the reasons provided by the Tribunal as involving an \" inconsistency \", it is considered, would be to engage in the \" over-zealous judicial review \" warned against in Wu Shan Liang.\nSee: Huttner R, Judicial Review of Refugee Decisions: The High Court's Decision in Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v Wu Shan Liang (1996) 3 AJ Admin L 222.\nThe reasons provided by the Tribunal adequately explain the basis upon which it proceeded.\n14 The first Ground of Appeal is therefore rejected.\n15 Section 424A(1)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) provides as follows:\n Information and invitation given in writing by Tribunal (1) Subject to subsections (2A) and (3), the Tribunal must: \n (a) give to the applicant, in the way that the Tribunal considers appropriate in the circumstances, clear particulars of any information that the Tribunal considers would be the reason, or a part of the reason, for affirming the decision that is under review; ... \nCompliance with this provision is mandatory: SAAP v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 , 215 ALR 162 ; SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [13] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 614 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ.\n16 One difficulty confronting the Appellant is that the second Ground of Appeal does not identify any \" information \" which falls within the provisions of s 424A(1)(a).\nThe ground only identifies what may properly be characterised as the factual findings made by the Tribunal.\n 2.\nThe Learned Federal Magistrate was in error in not determining that the Refugee Review Tribunal failed to comply with sec.\n424A(1)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 because of the following finding it made and thereby denying the Applicant with the opportunity to comply with this provision in terms of the decisions that were made in SAAP and SZEEU... \"The Tribunal does not accept the Applicant was again arrested in 1986.\nThe Tribunal notes the Applicant claimed in the hearing that this incident took place in June or July 1986 and he was detained for 2 days.\nHowever, in his Statement, the Applicant claimed it was early 1986, February, according to the evidence he provided to the first Tribunal and was detained for 4.5 days.\nThe applicant submits that this was a serious error made by the Tribunal.\"...\n17 The findings as made by the Tribunal and extracted in the second Ground of Appeal are not \" information \" which could fall within s 424A(1)(a).\nThis Ground of Appeal is more properly characterised as an impermissible challenge to the merits of the decision made by the Tribunal: NAHI v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 10 at [10] per Gray, Tamberlin and Lander JJ.\n18 At best, it is a contention that the Appellant was entitled to be informed of the findings as proposed to be made by the Tribunal and to be afforded a further opportunity to be heard.\nThe Appellant was not entitled to any such further opportunity.\nConcurrence is expressed with the reliance by the Federal Magistrate upon SZBYR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2007] HCA 26 at [18] , [2007] FCA 26 ; 235 ALR 609 at 616 and his Honour's conclusion that such findings do not fall within s 424A(1)(a).\n [18] ... if the reason why the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review was the Tribunal's disbelief of the appellants' evidence arising from inconsistencies therein, it is difficult to see how such disbelief could be characterised as constituting \"information\" within the meaning of para (a) of s 424A(1).\nAgain, if the Tribunal affirmed the decision because even the best view of the appellants' evidence failed to disclose a Convention nexus, it is hard to see how such a failure can constitute \"information\".\nFinn and Stone JJ correctly observed in VAF v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [[2004] FCAFC 123 , 206 ALR 471 at 477] that the word \"information\".\ndoes not encompass the tribunal's subjective appraisals, thought processes or determinations ... nor does it extend to identified gaps, defects or lack of detail or specificity in evidence or to conclusions arrived at by the tribunal in weighing up the evidence by reference to those gaps, etc.\nIf the contrary were true, s 424A would in effect oblige the Tribunal to give advance written notice not merely of its reasons but of each step in its prospective reasoning process.\nHowever broadly \"information\" be defined, its meaning in this context is related to the existence of evidentiary material or documentation, not the existence of doubts, inconsistencies or the absence of evidence.\nThe appellants were thus correct to concede that the relevant \"information\" was not to be found in inconsistencies or disbelief, as opposed to the text of the statutory declaration itself.\nSee also: SZICU v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCAFC 1 at [24] ---[25], 100 ALD 1 at 6---7 per Tamberlin, Finn and Besanko JJ; SZLBA v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 484 at [23] ---[24] per Cowdroy J.\n19 The ground is further without merit for the simple reason that such \" information \" as is to be discerned from the findings relied upon by the Appellant were -- in any event -- identified in a letter sent to him pursuant to s 424A(1)(a) on 9 October 2006.\n ...\nIn the hearing you claimed that the second time you were arrested was June or July 1986 and you were detained for 2 days.\nHowever in your statement, you claimed it was in early 1986 that you were arrested the second time, February according to the evidence you provided to the first Tribunal, and you were detained for 4.5 days.\nThis information is relevant because the discrepancies in the evidence you provided at various stages of the process as to when you were detained in 1986 and how long you were detained, raises doubts that you were arrested in 1986 at all.\nIt is also apparent from the reasons of the Tribunal that this issue, as raised in the 9 October 2006 letter, was further pursued with the now Appellant during the course of the hearing before the Tribunal.\n20 The second Ground of Appeal therefore is also rejected.\nAPPELLANT'S WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS?\n21 At the hearing of the appeal, the Appellant explained that both his Notice of Appeal , filed on 25 March 2008, and his written submissions, filed on 14 May 2008, were drafted by a Pakistani lawyer who had apparently returned to Pakistan on or about 16 May 2008.\nNot surprisingly -- and without being critical of the Appellant -- he was unable to assist the Court as to what was intended to be conveyed by either document.\n22 The Appellant, not surprisingly, had no knowledge as to the terms of s 424A of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) or the contents of the written submissions.\n23 It is not considered that the interests of unrepresented appellants in this Court are generally assisted by the provision of such purported assistance.\nCertainly this Court is not assisted by written submissions or grounds of appeal divorced from the issues resolved by the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Federal Magistrates Court.\n(i) a contention that the Tribunal had either misconstrued or not properly applied s 91R of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth); \n(ii) a contention that the Tribunal had failed to \" perform its statutory functions under either s.65 or s. 414 of the Migration Act \";\n(iii) a contention that the Tribunal had \" failed to assess information that the Appellant had worked for human rights for Sikhs \";\n(iv) a contention that the Tribunal was biased; \n(v) a contention that the Tribunal ignored the now Appellant's claims; \n(vi) a contention that there was no evidence to support \" the findings of the Tribunal \"; and \n(vii) a contention that the Tribunal's decision was otherwise \" not reasonable \" in the \" Wednesbury \" sense.\nNotwithstanding the Appellant's assertion that these submissions were drafted by a now absent Pakistani lawyer, they have all the hallmarks of having been drafted by an Australian legal practitioner.\nBut that issue need not presently be pursued further.\n25 Assuming that the written submissions constituted a previously unexpressed application for leave to amend the Notice of Appeal , the granting of such leave was opposed by the solicitor appearing for the Respondent Minister.\n(a) none of the grounds had been advanced before the Federal Magistrates Court; and \n(b) none of the grounds were formulated in such a manner as to be able to be properly understood.\nFurther, and more specifically, submissions focussed upon the fact that s 91R initially had been raised as a ground before the Federal Magistrates Court and an alternative ground expressly \" substituted \" in lieu.\nA party, of course, is generally not entitled to raise new grounds which were deliberately or by inadvertence not put to the court from which an appeal is brought: SZIBR v Minister for Immigration &amp; Citizenship [2008] FCA 502 at [38] per Lander J.\nThe contention that there was a failure to \" assess information \" is simply denied by the very task undertaken by the Tribunal.\nThat, and other grounds, it was submitted were thus without substance, nor was there any specification as to which of the \" findings \" of the Tribunal were said to have been made without sufficient evidentiary foundation.\n26 To entertain the written submissions filed by the Appellant, leave to amend the Notice of Appeal would necessarily have been required.\nThat leave was refused.\nThe submissions as advanced on behalf of the Respondent Minister should be accepted.\nNone of the grounds, it is considered, have merit: VUAX v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 158.\nThat, it should be noted, was the decision communicated to the Appellant during the course of the hearing of the appeal.\n27 The orders of the Court are:\n1.\nThe Appeal be dismissed.\n2.\nThe Appellant to pay the costs of the First Respondent of and incidental to the appeal.\nI certify that the preceding twenty-seven (27) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Flick.\nDated: 28 May 2008\n Counsel for the Appellant: The Appellant appeared in person \n Solicitor for the First Respondent: A Nanson (Australian Government Solicitor) \n Date of Hearing: 21 May 2008 \n Date of Judgment: 28 May 2008 \n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \n URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2008/778.html"

under which Bearsden purported to sell certain assets of a financial advisory business to Cairnsmore.\n2 The intention of the parties was apparently to transfer to Cairnsmore the right to service a number of clients of a financial planning and advisory business carried on at 60 Margaret Street, Sydney.\nThat right, if effectively transferred, would have carried with it the right to receive the fees (or a proportion of them) paid by the clients for the services.\n3 The business with which the parties were attempting to deal was the financial services business, the conduct of which was regulated under Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).\nHowever, the SBA purported to effect the sale of assets of the business, without paying attention to the statutory scheme under which the business was conducted.\n4 What is more, the SBA purported to effect the sale of a business that Bearsden did not carry on.\nThe introductory recitals stated falsely that Bearsden carried on the business and that it had the legal ownership.\n5 In fact, the business was that of Godfrey Pembroke Limited (GPL), which HBN Financial Management Pty Limited (HBN) conducted as an authorised representative of GPL in accordance with Part 7.6 of the Corporations Act .\n6 HBN was the trustee of a discretionary trust.\nBearsden was one of two unit holders in the trust.\nThe principal of Bearsden, Mr James Pearsen Hodge, was also a personal authorised representative of GPL.\n7 There was no contractual relationship between Bearsden and GPL.\nBearsden was merely a recipient of fees earned by HBN as an authorised representative of GPL.\n8 Bearsden was the trustee of Mr Hodge's family trust.\nBearsden on-distributed the fees received from HBN to Mr Hodge and other members of his family as beneficiaries of the family trust.\n9 The SBA provided for the purchase price to be payable in three instalments.\nThe first instalment of approximately $351,000 was paid on 27 July 2004.\nThe second instalment was due on 27 July 2005 and the third instalment 12 months later.\n10 Cairnsmore did not hold authorised representative status under the Corporations Act , nor did its principal, Mr Vernon Howland.\nHowever, the SBA provided for Cairnsmore to have possession of the assets purchased on the date of payment of the first instalment.\n11 In order to overcome the gap in satisfying the statutory requirements, the SBA anticipated that Mr Howland would undertake the necessary training to obtain authorised representative status.\nNo period was stipulated for this to occur but the SBA provided for a \"transition period\" of two years.\nDuring the transition period Bearsden was obliged to assist in the \"transition\" of clients to Cairnsmore.\n12 Provision was made in the SBA for Cairnsmore to obtain office services at the Margaret Street premises occupied by HBN.\nCairnsmore was to pay a monthly fee of $5,800 as its proportion of the costs of the services.\n13 Mr Howland was given space, albeit in the photocopy room, from 27 July 2004 and was introduced to clients commencing from that date.\nCairnsmore received fees from that time and also paid its monthly cost allocation.\n14 The SBA anticipated a possible change in the identity of the AFS licensee.\nThat is to say, it was anticipated between the parties that the principal for whom the proper authority-holders were acting as authorised representatives would not be GPL.\n15 Bearsden warranted in the SBA that if the identity of the AFS licensee should alter, during the transition period, then Cairnsmore would not be disadvantaged by any such change.\nSee clause 9, extracted below.\n16 With effect from 1 April 2005, HBN and Mr Hodge ceased to be authorised representatives of GPL.\nOn or about 1 April 2005, Mr Hodge wrote to all of the clients of the business, including those purportedly transferred to Cairnsmore under the SBA, informing them that he would no longer be an authorised representative of GPL.\n17 Mr Hodge's letters to the clients stated that he had notified GPL of his resignation \"to join a new licensee under the name of, Paragem.\n Unless you advise within 14 days to the contrary, you will be transferred as a client of mine to the Paragem licensee.\n18 The move from GPL to Paragem caused considerable tension between Mr Howland and Mr Hodge.\nBy letter dated 1 July 2005, the then solicitors for Cairnsmore wrote to Bearsden's solicitors.\nThe letter stated that Bearsden has repudiated the SBA.\n19 Bearsden's solicitors responded to the letter on 18 July 2005, asserting the Cairnsmore had \"walked away\" from the SBA.\n20 Cairnsmore solicitors replied on the same day stating that their instructions were that Cairnsmore accepted Bearsden's repudiation of the SBA and terminated that agreement.\n (i) Whether upon the proper construction of the SBA, Bearsden contracted to sell the assets of the business in which it had no legal or beneficial interest.\n(ii) If so, whether Cairnsmore is entitled to damages for breach of contract in accordance with the principles stated by Dixon J and Fullagar J in McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission [1950] HCA 12 ; (1951) 84 CLR 377 at 409 --- 415.\n(iii) Whether the move from GPL to Paragem constituted the exercise of a \"right of title\" by Bearsden under cl 5.4 of the SBA, thereby entitling Cairnsmore to a refund of the first instalment and damages for breach of contract.\nSee McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Limited [1933] HCA 25 ; (1933) 48 CLR 457.\n(iv) Whether the move from GPL to Paragem was to the disadvantage of Cairnsmore within the meaning of cl 9.1 of the SBA.\n(v) Whether Cairnsmore is entitled to recover damages either in contract or under the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) for expenditure incurred by it in reliance upon representations made by Bearsden in the SBA that it owned and carried on the business and had the right to sell it.\n(vi) Whether Cairnsmore and Mr Howland are entitled to recover against Mr Hodge by virtue of ss 6(3) or 75B of the Trade Practices Act .\n(vii) Whether, if Cairnsmore's contentions are not correct, Bearsden is entitled to recover payment of the second and third instalments of the purchase price as claimed by it in its cross claim.\n The SBA \n22 The SBA is a lengthy document.\nIt was not prepared by solicitors but was adapted by Mr Hodge from another contract that had been drawn by solicitors.\nThe other contract provided for the purchase by HBN of a financial services business conducted at Milsons Point.\n23 The parties to the SBA were Bearsden and Cairnsmore, but Mr Hodge's name appears on the cover sheet.\n Introduction \n A.\nThe Seller carries on the Business.\n B.\nThe Seller has legal ownership of the business and is authorised to sell part of that business to the Buyer.\n Operative Clauses \n 1.\n In this agreement : \n AFS Licensee means Godfrey Pembroke Ltd. ABN 23 002 336 254 \n Agency Agreement means the document attached as Annexure A.\n Assets Purchased means the Seller's rights and interests in the Clients, the Client Files and the right to receive Future Revenue and Goodwill generated by the business relationship with the clients.\nFor the avoidance of doubt assets purchased excludes the WIP as at date of completion but includes any transfer of rights associated with all life insurance agencies, master trusts, wrap accounts, retail investments and other agencies or representative arrangements associated with the clients.\n Business means the business of providing financial planning and product advice to the Clients as Authorised Representative of the AFS Licensee carried on by the Seller at the Premises.\n ... \n Client Files means all files, working papers, records and information (and rights in relation thereto) in paper and electronic format relating to the Clients in the possession or custody of the Seller.\n Clients means a specified list of the clients of the Business as set out in Annexure B where Recurring Revenue in relation thereto equates to $300000 per annum, plus or minus 3% as at Completion Date.\n ... \n Future Revenue means the Gross Revenue payable by Clients with respect to any period as and from the Completion Date and for the avoidance of doubt does not include WIP at Completion Date.\n Goodwill means: \n &#8226; the goodwill of the Business; and \n &#8226; the exclusive right of the Buyer to represent the Buyer as carrying on the Business as the Seller's successor \n Gross Revenue means the gross amount of Recurring Revenue payable by the Clients or payable by third parties with respect to the Clients prior to deduction therefrom of any amounts payable to the AFS Licensee and includes any volume bonuses in relation to the Clients payable by the AFS Licensee.\n HBN means HBN Financial Management Pty Ltd (ABN 250841203655) \n ... \n Premises means the premises at Level 12, 60 Margaret Street, Sydney NSW 2000 \n Purchase Price means the purchase price for the Assets referred to in clause 4.\nPurchase price is three (3) times the Recurring Revenue as established at Completion Date.\n Recurring Revenue means the Gross Revenue being fees, commissions, charges and any other amounts (including without limitation trail commissions) and excluding fees commissions and any other amounts received for once only events.\nTherefore Recurring Revenue excludes plan preparation fees, implementation fees and commissions.\nRecurring Revenue excludes GST.\n Settlement Date means the date the First Instalment of the Purchase Price is paid.\n Transition Period means the period of twenty four months (or earlier if mutually agreed) following Completion Date \n ... \n 3.\n Subject to this agreement: \n 3.1 The Seller must sell the legal and beneficial interest in the Assets Purchased to the Buyer, free from Encumbrances.\n 3.2 The Buyer must buy the legal and beneficial interest in the Assets Purchased from the Seller, free from Encumbrances.\n ... \n 4.\n The purchase price for the Assets Purchased is the sum of three times Recurring Revenue as established at Completion Date from

\n (a) The First payment date will be 40% of the purchase price and this will be paid on the Settlement Date.\n (b) The Second payment and payment date will be 30% of the ongoing fee revenue obtained for the second twelve month period from the list of clients at Annexure C at a date twelve (12) months from the Settlement Date \n (c) The Third and final payment date will be 30% of the ongoing fee revenue obtained for the second twelve month period from the list of clients at Annexure C at a date twenty four (24) months from the Settlement Date \n ... \n 5.3 If a Client expresses a desire to revert to Seller then the Buyer and the Seller agree the Seller will substitute a client of equivalent fee size and age profile.\n 5.4 The Seller reserves title to the Assets until such time as the whole of the Purchase Price has been paid by the Buyer to the Seller.\nIf this right of title is exercised under this agreement then the Seller agrees to refund all payments made under clause 5.1 to the Buyer.\n For the avoidance of doubt the calculations exclude any new business from Clients listed at Annexure C, and from new clients after Completion Date.\n 6.\n Property in the Assets Purchased passes to the Buyer upon payment of the whole of the Purchase Price which is the Final Date.\n 7.\n Possession \n Possession of the Assets Purchased passes to the Buyer at Settlement Date.\n 8.\n 8.1 Until the Buyer obtains AFS Licensee Proper Authority / Authorised Representative status the Seller agrees to allow the Buyer to assist in the preparation of Financial Planning advice to the Clients from the Premises under the Seller's AFS Licensee Proper Authority / Authorised Representative status.\n 8.2 When Buyer obtains AFS Licensee Proper Authority / Authorised Representative status the Seller agrees to facilitate transfer of the Clients to the Buyers identification code with the AFS Licensee at and of that time.\n 8.3 Notwithstanding 8.1 and 8.2 above the Seller agrees that the Buyer is included in the Agency Agreement at Annexure A that is utilised to manage the business... \n25 The Agency Agreement at Annexure A was purportedly signed on behalf of HBN.\nIt was also signed on behalf of Bearsden and Cairnsmore.\n26 The document stated that the obligations entered into by HBN pursuant to the SBA were the obligations of Bearsden and Cairnsmore (to the extent of the SBA between Bearsden and Cairnsmore).\nIt also stated that any amounts received or receivable by HBN pursuant to the Business Agreement SBA were received on behalf of and as agent for Bearsden and Cairnsmore.\nThe amount was said to be as determined between them from time to time.\n 9.\n 9.1 During the period from Completion Date to the Third Payment Date the Seller warrants that should the AFS Licensee alter then the Buyer will not be disadvantaged by any such change and that any advantages accruing to the Seller in his capacity as Authorised Representative of the altered AFS Licensee as a result of such change will also accrue to the Buyer.\n 9.2 All terms and conditions, obligations and rights of the Seller and of the Buyer in this Agreement that are or may be effected [sic] by an alteration in the AFS Licensee remain unchanged (as if no alteration had occurred) in the event that the AFS Licensee alters \n 10.\n Notwithstanding any other clauses in this Agreement the agreement is subject to the following Fundamental Condition: \n 10.1 If AFS Licensee or its successor(s) unreasonably withholds Authorised Representative status from the Buyer once the Buyer has achieved PS 146 status, the Seller agrees: \n (a) each party must return the documents delivered to it at completion; \n (b) each party must repay all Purchase Price monies paid at and since completion; \n (c) to do all things necessary to reverse any action taken at completion \n 11.\n 11.1 The Buyer warrants that it was not introduced to the Seller or the Business by any agent, broker or other person pursuant to whom the Seller may become liable for payment of any fees or commissions with respect to the sale and purchase of the Business.\n 11.2 The Buyer must indemnify and keep indemnified the Seller against all claims, suits, demands, proceedings, notices, liabilities, loss, damage, costs and expenses arising under or with respect to any circumstances that give rise to a breach of the warranty contained in clause 11.1.\n ... \n 13.\n Completion takes place on the Settlement Date.\n ... \n 15.\n 15.1 Without limiting the effect or operation of clause 5, the Seller must deliver to the Buyer: \n (a) all Client Files both paper and electronic \n (b) continuing access to hardware and software to manage, read and print (if necessary) those records retained in electronic format \n (c) continuing access to the Premises \n (d) a copy of any Power of Attorney under which a document is executed for the Seller \n (e) evidences satisfying the Buyer that the Seller authorised a person to sign a document for the Seller \n (f) all other documents and things relating to the Business which the Buyer reasonably requires \n 15.2 The Seller obtains administration and other services from HBN Financial Services Trust.\nThe Seller will ensure that the same level and quality of services will be provided to Buyer from Settlement date.\nCosts associated with such services are as specified in Annexure B.\nIt is agreed that these will be indexed to the Australia wide Consumer Price index (CPI) for the preceding prior year on the Second Payment Date.\n In this clause, unless otherwise provided, an executed document is a document executed by the Seller and each other party to that document, except the Buyer.\n28 The costs of services referred to in cl 15.2 were described in Annexure B appearing on p 745 of Exhibit A in the proceedings.\nThe document was headed \"Cost Apportionment\".\nThat document provided for Cairnsmore to pay $5,800 per month.\nIt also showed a comparison between revenue anticipated to be received by Cairnsmore under the GPL licence.\nThis was compared with the revenue anticipated from the Paragem licence.\n29 Relevantly, Annexure B showed that the licence fee payable to GPL was 12.5 per cent of gross revenue and the licence fee anticipated to be payable to Paragem was shown as 8.3 per cent.\nThis would have resulted in a net advantage to Cairnsmore arising from a move to Paragem.\n30 I return once again to the salient provisions of the SBA:\n 18.\n 18.1 During the period from Completion to the Date when Buyer obtains its AFS Licensee Proper Authority / Authorised representative status the Seller agrees to transfer all of the fee revenue relating to the Assets Purchased and to any new clients introduced by the Buyer to an account nominated by the Buyer on a monthly basis within five (5) working days following the month end in which the revenue is received.\nThe Buyer is to provide to Bearsden Holdings Pty Ltd a valid Tax Invoice, including GST, to cover the fee revenue receivable.\n 18.2 During the period from Completion to the Final Payment the Buyer agrees to pay costs in accordance with clause 15 on a monthly basis within five (5) working days following the month end in which the costs have been billed.\nThe Seller is to provide to the Buyer a valid Tax Invoice, including GST, to cover the cost recovery payable.\n ... \n 19.\n 19.1 For a period, of up to twenty four (24) months as the Buyer requires, commencing on the Completion Day, the Seller must without remuneration: \n (a) Help the transition of the Business to the Buyer \n (b) introduce the Buyer to the [sic] each of the Clients and assist in their transition to the Buyer.\n (c) use best efforts to induce Clients to deal with the Buyer \n (d) provide information about the Business or the Premises or the Assets as the Buyer reasonably requires \n (e) train the Buyer in all of the necessary business systems and processes, financial planning processes and technical matters that are necessary for the Buyer to act as a professional Financial Planner \n 19.2 For a period of up to twenty four (24) months as the Seller requires, commencing on the Completion Day, the Buyer (provided it is not detrimental to the servicing of the Clients) may also assist with tasks that may not be directly relevant to the Clients but which may assist the learning experience of the Buyer.\n (a) attending client review meetings \n (b) preparing statements of advice \n (c) assisting with client seminars \n (d) assisting with answers to client e-mails \n ... \n 22.\n 22.1 Each warranty is true at the date of this agreement, at Completion, and at Settlement Date.\n 22.2 No warranty is limited by nay other warranty.\n 22.3 Each warranty is also a representation.\n 22.4 Each party enters into this agreement in reliance on the warranties in this agreement.\n ... \n 24.\n The Seller warrants: \n (a) Immediately prior to Completion, and at Settlement, the Seller will legally and beneficially own the Assets Purchased, free from Encumbrance \n (b) The Seller has the right to enter this agreement and to sell the Assets Purchased without the consent of any other person or legal entity.\n 25.\n The Seller warrants that all information, given by or for the Seller to the Buyer or the Buyer's advisers during negotiations for this agreement is true and complete and not misleading.\n 28.\n 28.1 The Buyer indemnifies the Seller against all losses, costs, liability and expenses incurred by the Seller because of a breach of this agreement by the Buyer.\n 28.2 The Seller indemnifies the Buyer against all losses, costs, liability and expenses incurred by the Buyer: \n (a) because of a breach of this agreement by the Seller \n (b) because some thing is not as represented or warranted in this agreement \n (c) because information or a certificate or a declaration, provided by or for the Seller in connection with this sale, is inaccurate or misleading \n (d) in respect of claims or trade practices suits about the Stock or the Business, arising from an act or omission before completion \n 29.\n 29.1 The Buyer may make a claim for breach of a warranty under this agreement only if: \n (a) the amount claimed for any one breach exceeds $15,000; or \n (b) the aggregate amount claimed for all similar breaches exceeds $15,000.\n 29.2 The aggregate liability of the Seller for all claims under the warranties in this agreement cannot exceed the Purchase Price.\n ... \n 40.\n 40.1 This document records the entire agreement between the parties about the Business, the Premises, the costs, the Revenues and the Assets... \n The Legislative Background \n31 The provisions of Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act were introduced by the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (Cth).\n32 The licensing regime contained in Part 7.6 is described in A J Black, \"Licensing of Financial Services Providers\" in Butterworths Australian Corporation Law: Principles and Practice , Vol 2 at [7.7.0005ff].\nAs Mr Black observes at [7.7.0005], the licensing regime secures the adequacy of capitalisation of providers of financial services; it excludes unqualified and untrained persons from the industry and enforces compliance with ethical standards.\nThese objectives are stated in s 760A of the Corporations Act and are reflected in the provisions of Chapter 7.\n33 The authors of Ford's Principles of Corporations Law point out at [22.010] that Chapter 7 seeks to regulate financial advice and dealings in relation to all financial products by a single regime which provides for licensing of all persons who offer financial services.\n34 The relevant provisions for present purposes are ss 761A , 766A , 766B (1), 910A , 911A , 911B , 911C , 912A , 912B , 913A , 913B , 913C , 914A , 916A , 916B and 916F .\nI will reproduce only a number of those provisions, which are as follows.\n (1) Subject to this section, a person who carries on a financial services business in this jurisdiction must hold an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the financial services.\nNote 1: Also, a person must not provide a financial service contrary to a banning order or disqualification order under Division 8.\nNote 2: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).\n 911B Providing financial services on behalf of a person who carries on a financial services business \n (1) A person (the provider ) must only provide a financial service in this jurisdiction on behalf of another person (the principal ) who carries on a financial services business if one or more of the following paragraphs apply:...\n (b) these conditions are satisfied:\n (i) the principal holds an Australian financial services licence covering the provision of the service; and\n (ii) the provider is an authorised representative of the principal; and\n (iii) the authorisation covers the provision of the service by the provider...\nFailure to comply with this subsection is an offence under section 1311.\n A person must not hold out:...\n (c) that, in providing a financial service, the person acts on behalf of another person; ...\n if that is not the case.\nNote: Failure to comply with this section is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).\n35 Section 912A(1) states the obligations of a Financial Services Licensee.\nThese include complying with the conditions of the licence, taking reasonable steps to ensure that representatives comply with financial services laws, and ensuring that representatives are adequately trained and competent to provide the services.\n36 Section 916B prohibits authorised representatives from appointing sub-representatives.\n 916B Sub-authorisations \n (1) Subject to subsection (3), an authorised representative of a financial services licensee cannot, in that capacity, make a person their authorised representative or an authorised representative of the licensee.\n(2) A purported authorisation contrary to this section is void.\n(2A) A person must not give a purported authorisation if that purported authorisation is contrary to this section.\nNote: Failure to comply with this subsection is an offence (see subsection 1311(1)).\n(3) A body corporate that is an authorised representative of a financial services licensee may, in that capacity, give an individual a written notice authorising that individual, for the purposes of this Chapter, to provide a specified financial service or financial services on behalf of the licensee, but only if the licensee consents in writing given to the body corporate.\n37 The essential facts can be stated briefly.\nI have referred to most of them in the Introduction.\n38 GPL was the Australian Financial Services (AFS) licensee.\nHBN was its corporate authorised representative.\nMr Hodge and his associate, Mr Nicol, were personal authorised representatives of GPL.\n39 HBN was the trustee of the HBN Financial Services Trust.\nBearsden and Mr Nicol's company, Locin, each held two units in that trust.\n40 Bearsden held its units in the HBN Financial Services Trust as trustee for the Korinya Trust, a discretionary family trust, for the benefit of Mr Hodge and his family.\n41 The relationships are more fully explained in diagrammatic form in a document handed up by counsel for Cairnsmore.\nThe diagram provides references to the various agreements under which the relationships were established.\nThe commentary and the diagram are correct and I adopt the diagram and the explanatory statements made in it.\nA copy of that document is attached to my reasons for judgment.\nCounsel for Bearsden accepted the accuracy of the diagrammatic representation of the various relationships.\n42 Mr Howland first met Mr Hodge in early April 2004 at a conference on financial planning arranged by the National Australia Bank ('NAB').\n43 Mr Howland is a qualified chartered accountant.\nHe was interested in a career change and wished to pursue a career in financial advice and planning.\nHe approached Mr Hodge because he had heard that Mr Hodge may be interested in selling a part of his financial planning business.\n44 Mr Howland and Mr Hodge had a preliminary meeting on 30 April 2004 to discuss the possible sale.\nMr Howland was interested in buying into the business because he considered that GPL had an established reputation in the industry providing premium service, in particular, because of its connection with the NAB.\n45 There was a follow-up meeting between Mr Howland and Mr Hodge on 7 May 2004.\nMr Hodge wrote a letter to Mr Howland on that date which he provided to Mr Howland at the meeting.\n Since our meeting of last week, I have decided to consider the sale of part of my business (say, $300,000 of fees) provided it is suitable to both of us.\n The main factor in determining a successful outcome of any arrangement would be that we all get on together.\nDon and I each own our individual client revenues, pay some costs directly and share other expenses.\nWe trust each other as business associates and respect each other's contribution to our joint business.\nWe have been together for nine years or so and share similar ideals and aspirations for our business.\n If I were to sell part of my business, the person to whom I sell would need to fit in and feel comfortable with us and our approach... \n In your case, I would envisage that you would become involved with your clients from day one and would take over prime contact with each client on a day to day basis as you felt comfortable doing so.\nI would contact the client only when you felt I needed to, but would continue to attend annual review meetings for, say, two years or so, depending on how you felt.\n I imagine that you will need a lot of education and hands on... \n I mentioned to you that I have been trying for some years to establish a vehicle whereby I could share the ownership of the investment platform and also pass on reduced platform costs to my clients.\nDon and I have been doing the latter for some time, as I will explain to you separately.\n Hopefully this dream is near to becoming a reality with Paragem.\n We are very focused on what is in the client's best interest.\nThere is often a conflict between what is in the client's best interest and what is in the adviser's or client's best interest.\n &#8226; The bank provides incentives to used their Masterkey / Flexiplan platform in terms of both increased retirement payout incentives and reduced charges; \n &#8226; NAB's margin lending interest rate is 7.80%.\n &#8226; We do not accept any trails or incentives from banks, margin lenders, insurance agencies, or fund managers; \n &#8226; Our clients have the lowest platform rates available in the market and we do not add a loading like most groups... \n Today I have provided you with a lot of information and thoughts and many more discussions will be necessary.\n I hope my comments are of assistance with your evaluation of your options... \n46 It is plain from this letter that the possibility of a change from GPL to Paragem was discussed at the meeting.\n47 The next meeting between Mr Howland and Mr Hodge took place on 19 May 2004.\nMr Hodge handed a document to Mr Howland at the meeting.\nThe document was a form of information memorandum for the sale of the business.\nIt referred to Bearsden and was the first time that Bearsden's name was mentioned in the discussions between the parties.\n48 The document was headed \"Bearsden Holdings Pty Limited, Financial Planning Business, James Hodge, Client Adviser\".\nIt described the key characteristics of the business and stated that the client base could be considered to be \"sticky\" for a number of reasons.\nBy that, Mr Hodge meant that the clients were likely to stick with the business, rather than move elsewhere.\n49 The information memorandum referred to the form of computer software employed by the business for its financial products as \"Tower Wrap\".\nThere was some discussion at the meeting about the Tower product.\nMr Hodge said it was unsatisfactory and that he was looking for an alternative.\n50 The information memorandum also stated that the business would introduce a number of changes that would lead to a significant improvement in net profit.\nOne of these was that the fee payable to the AFS license holder would fall from approximately $170,000 to $25,000.\nAccording to Mr Hodge, this was because the licence would be owned jointly by Mr Hodge and Mr Nicol and \"no dealer fee\" would be payable.\nHe said it was not referable to any possible move to Paragem.\n51 The proposed purchase price was stated in the information memorandum as three times the ongoing fee revenue received from a named list of clients.\n52 It is evident from section 5 of the information memorandum and the notes on it, that the parties discussed the sale of clients generating $300,000 per annum in fees.\nThe total purchase price of approximately $900,000 would be payable in three instalments , with 40 per cent at the time when the contract was signed, 30 per cent 12 months thereafter and the final 30 per cent two years from the date of the contract.\n53 The information memorandum stated that Bearsden owned the client fee income reflected in a profit and loss account of the HBN Financial Services Trust, which was attached.\n54 At the meeting of 19 May 2004, or at a later meeting, Mr Howland told Mr Hodge that he would have to borrow the whole of the purchase price.\nHe also informed Mr Hodge prior to execution of the SBA that he would have to give security to the lender over his family home at Warrawee.\nI reject Mr Hodge's denial of this.\n55 There was a further meeting between the parties on 28 May 2004.\nMr Hodge handed to Mr Howland a document entitled \"Binding Term Sheet\" which described the basis of the sale and purchase of part of the financial planning business of Bearsden.\n56 The Binding Term Sheet stated an agreed position in relation to stipulated items.\nThese included the subject matter of the purchase, the price, the instalment terms, the expenses to be met by the purchaser and the transition period.\n57 On 17 June 2004, Mr Hodge emailed to Mr Howland a draft of the SBA.\nIt is plain from the draft that it was the document upon which the final executed SBA was based.\nThe draft document was a copy of a sale of business agreement prepared by a firm of solicitors for the purchase by HBN of a financial planning business at Milsons Point.\n58 It is evident that by 17 June 2004, Mr Hodge had informed Mr Howland that Paragem Pty Limited was a company associated with Mr Ian Knox.\nMr Knox wrote, on the letterhead of Paragem, to Mr Howland on 17 June 2004 confirming that it could provide assistance in educational material to enable Mr Howland to obtain the necessary financial services qualifications.\n59 Prior to 29 June 2004, Mr Howland informed Mr Hodge that he needed a letter to provide to his bank showing the amount of the monthly outgoings to be met by the purchaser.\nOn 29 June 2004, Mr Hodge sent a letter to Mr Howland confirming the monthly cost allocation of $5,800.\n60 The letter also stated a comparison of the return forecast to Mr Howland under the GPL licence as compared to that which would occur under Paragem.\nThe letter stipulated a 12.5 per cent fee to GPL and an 8.3 per cent fee to Paragem; that portion of the letter was replicated in Annexure B to the SBA.\n61 Although the final form of the SBA was not executed until 26 July 2004, a document in virtually identical form was executed by the parties on 23 July 2004.\nMr Howland delivered that document to his financier, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, on 23 July 2004.\n Further to the documents I delivered to your office late Friday afternoon 23rd, please HOLD the AUHTORITY TO PAY document until I send you an e mail to confirm its release.\nAll other documents are in order.\n I have a question for the vendor I'd like to get answered before the funds are transferred.\nI expect to get this during Monday (26th) morning.\n I will send a follow up e-mail to confirm the RELEASE for processing of the AUTHORITY TO PAY document as soon as this is done.\n62 Before the SBA was signed on 26 July 2004, Mr Howland met with Mr Hodge.\nHe asked Mr Hodge to confirm that if the move to Paragem took place during the transition period, Mr Howland would be involved.\nMr Hodge told Mr Howland that the move would not take place without Mr Howland's consent.\nI reject Mr Hodge's denial of that conversation.\n63 From about 27 July 2004 Mr Howland worked out of HBN's premises at Margaret Street.\nMr Hodge introduced him to clients as a person who had come into the business.\nMr Hodge did not tell the clients that Mr Howland or his company had purchased the right to service the clients.\n64 During the period Mr Hodge was pursuing his plan to move to Paragem.\nThe plan was sufficiently definite that on 2 December 2004 he sent an email to one of HBN's large clients describing Paragem as \"the dealer we will be changing to.\n65 On 7 January 2005 Mr Hodge sent a memorandum to Mr Nicol with a copy to Mr Knox.\nThe memorandum stated that Mr Hodge was proceeding on the assumption that \"I will be advising my clients and resigning during the last week of January.\n\" This was a reference to his intended resignation from his authorised representative status for GPL.\nHe said he hoped that the move could be completed in February.\nIt is plain from the memorandum that he regarded the move to Paragem as non-negotiable.\nHe did not send a copy of the memorandum to Mr Howland.\n66 Nevertheless there were some discussions between Mr Hodge and Mr Howland about the move to Paragem in January 2005.\nOn 13 January 2005, Mr Hodge sent an email to Mr Howland, Mr Knox and Mr Nicol with a proposed draft letter to clients.\nThe draft stated, \"We have chosen Paragem Pty Limited as our new dealer organisation.\n67 On 20 January 2005, there was a meeting between Mr Hodge, Mr Nicol and Mr Howland at which the move to Paragem was discussed.\nIt is plain that Mr Howland was concerned about the proposed move.\n68 On 11 February 2005, Mr Hodge met with Mr Howland to discuss Mr Howland's concerns about the move to Paragem.\nIt is clear from Mr Hodge's notes of the meeting that Mr Howland was unhappy about the lack of detail provided by Mr Hodge relating to the proposed move to Paragem.\nIt is evident that he expressed his concerns and that Mr Hodge was \"a little concerned with Howland's desire to proceed at this time.\n69 It appears that at the meeting on 11 February 2005, Mr Hodge told Mr Howland that Mr Hodge was concerned about delays in Mr Howland obtaining authorised representative status.\n70 Mr Hodge is not a 'details' person.\nHe referred Mr Howland to Mr Knox to try to satisfy Mr Howland's concerns about the details of the proposed transaction.\nThere were meetings between Mr Howland and Mr Knox in February and March 2005.\n71 In February 2005, Mr Hodge gave notice to GPL of his intended resignation as an authorised representative.\nIt would appear that this was to take effect by 1 April 2005.\n72 On 1 March 2005, Mr Howland sent an email to Mr Hodge.\nThe email referred to Mr Hodge's plan to send details to clients on 3 March 2005 advising them of the proposed move to Paragem.\nMr Howland stated that he felt this was premature until a number of specified details were cleared up.\n73 I reject Mr Hodge's evidence that he was unaware from the email that Mr Howland was objecting to the move to Paragem until Mr Howland's concerns were cleared up.\n74 Mr Hodge's evidence was contrary to the plain terms of the email.\nHis failure to accept what was put to him by counsel for Cairnsmore reflected badly on his credit.\nThis was just one of many instances.\n75 By 1 March 2005 and probably earlier (ie.\n7 January 2005), Mr Hodge had made up his mind to move to Paragem come what may.\nHe did not wish to brook any opposition to this course.\n76 On 31 March 2005 Mr Howland sent an email to Mr Hodge.\n I appreciate we are all working to the same goal, to get the Paragem arrangements up and working.\n Over the last 8 months (and I acknowledge much longer for you) we have been trying to get Ian to deliver a product and service that will allow us to serve our clients to at least the level of service we can offer them under the current Godfrey Pembroke service offering, and better where this is possible.\nA lessening of offering to the GPL model would disadvantage our clients, and myself as a Financial Planner to service them.\n You are planning on distributing advice letters to the client base to formally advise them of the change to occur.\n I do not wish these letter to go [sic] the clients I am acquiring from you.\nThis is because there are a number of significant issues that are simply too important to say \"they will be word out.\n77 Notwithstanding Mr Hodge's reluctance to accept the proposition, he was determined to ignore Mr Howland's email.\nLetters to clients were sent by Mr Hodge on the same day, 31 March 2005, or on 1 April 2005.\nThe clients to whom the letters were sent included clients purportedly sold to Cairnsmore.\nI referred earlier to the letters which stated that \"you will be transferred as a client of mine\" to Paragem.\n78 The effective date of the move to Paragem was 1 April 2005.\nHBN continued to receive fees from GPL in respect of services provided up to that date.\nA statement from GPL to HBN for the period 24 March 2005 to 7 April 2005 records commission payable.\n79 The rate of dealer commission or fee to GPL for the last two-week period recorded in the commission statement was 9.11 per cent.\nThis was lower than the 12.5 per cent recorded in the SBA.\nIt has an important bearing on the issue of whether Cairnsmore was disadvantaged by the move to Paragem.\nI will deal with that issue later.\n80 On 28 April 2005, there was a planning session for the move to Paragem.\nThe meeting was attended by Mr Hodge, Mr Howland, Mr Knox and others.\nThe meeting took place at the Azuma restaurant in the Chifley Tower.\nA document was handed out of the meeting and the discussion included a presentation made by Mr Howland.\n81 Whatever took place at the planning session it is clear that Mr Howland was determined at about this time that he did not wish Cairnsmore to proceed with the SBA.\nIn my view what engendered this was his opposition to the proposed move to Paragem.\n82 A heated meeting took place between Mr Howland and Mr Hodge on 4 May 2005.\nMr Howland told Mr Hodge that he did not wish to proceed with the SBA.\nHe also said that he wanted Mr Hodge to return the money paid under the SBA, ie: the first instalment, but that he wanted to retain fees received by Cairnsmore to date.\n83 By 4 May 2005 any trust and confidence between Mr Howland and Mr Hodge had gone.\nMr Hodge did not want Mr Howland to be involved in the business.\nHe told Mr Howland at the meeting of 4 May 2005 that Mr Howland was not welcome at the forthcoming Paragem launch and he should \"stay away\" from it.\n84 The relationship between Mr Howland and Mr Hodge was so bad by this time that Mr Knox tried to act as an intermediary.\nThere was a meeting between Mr Knox and Mr Howland for that purpose but Mr Knox's intervention was unsuccessful.\n85 On 1 July 2005 Minter Ellison wrote on Cairnsmore's behalf to Bearsden's solicitors stating that Bearsden had repudiated the SBA.\nOn 18 July 2005 Bearsden's solicitors wrote to Minter Ellison asserting that Cairnsmore was in breach.\nOn the same date Minter Ellison wrote to Bearsden's solicitors accepting Bearsden's repudiation of the SBA and terminating it.\n86 These proceedings were commenced by an application filed on 6 November 2006.\n87 The SBA is to be construed in accordance with the objective theory of contractual construction reaffirmed by the High Court in Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at [40] .\n88 This requires the court when construing a commercial contract to have regard to the commercial purpose of the contract, the context and the market in which the parties were operating: Reardon Smith Line Ltd v Hansen-Tangen [1976] 1 WLR 989 at 995-996; Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas [2004] HCA 35 ; (2004) 218 CLR 451 at [22] .\n89 The commercial purpose of the SBA was for Bearsden to sell a part of the business to Cairnsmore.\nThe specified part was the \"assets purchased.\n\" They consisted of four items for which Cairnsmore was to pay approximately $1 million in three instalments.\n90 Each of the assets purchased was an asset of the business as defined in the SBA.\nThe business was that of providing financial planning and product advice to clients as authorised representative of GPL.\n91 The only proper construction of the SBA on the face of the written agreement is that what Bearsden purported to sell was the financial services business which it conducted as authorised representative of GPL.\nThat construction is reinforced by the provisions of Part 7.6 of the Corporations Act .\n92 It was submitted on behalf of Bearsden that the business was Bearsden's income stream which was actually delivered to Cairnsmore for some part of the period during which Mr Howland worked in the business.\nI reject that approach to construction for three reasons.\n93 First, it is contrary to the plain meaning of the SBA.\nSecond, it ignores the elaborate structure which GPL and HBN put in place to comply with Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act .\nThird, it would produce an agreement that contravened the provisions of Chapter 7 of the Corporations Act .\nOn an objective approach that could not have been the intention of the parties.\n94 It was also submitted on behalf of Bearsden that any defect in its title was cured in about February 2006 when Bearsden became an authorised representative of Paragem.\nThis submission cannot be accepted for at least two reasons.\n95 First, it is not what Bearsden contracted to sell under the SBA.\nSecond, it would have been contrary to Part 7.6 of the Corporations Act , in particular s 916B(3).\nAs in McCrae , the only proper construction of the SBA is that it included a promise by Bearsden that the subject matter of the agreement existed: see McRae at 410.\nIt is plain that the subject matter did not exist because Bearsden did not own the business.\nThe subject matter was not simply a business conducted at the premises, it was the business owned by Bearsden.\nIt is true that Bearsden had the power to direct where the income stream that it received through HBN was paid, but it had no enforceable right against GPL because there was no contractual relationship between those parties.\n96 In short, the commercial purpose which Bearsden sought to achieve could not have been put in place without an agreement between HBN and Cairnsmore.\nIt would in my view have been necessary in addition for GPL to have been a party.\nThe defect was not cured by Annexure B to the SBA, ie, the Agency Agreement on p 743 of Exhibit A.\nThat document was legally ineffective (even if it was properly executed on behalf of HBN, which I doubt).\nThis is because it entirely ignored the structure in place in the various agreements fully described in counsel's diagram annexed to my reasons for judgment.\n97 This case therefore falls within the principles stated by Dixon and Fullagar JJ in McCrae at 409 to 411.\nBearsden must pay damages for breach of its promise to give title.\n98 Whether or not Cairnsmore relied on that breach when it gave notice of the termination of the SBA, it is open to Cairnsmore to rely on that breach in these proceedings: see Shepherd v Felt &amp; Textiles of Australia Limited [1931] HCA 21 ; (1931) 45 CLR 359.\n99 I will deal later with the question of damages.\n100 Clause 5.4 is to be construed in the light of the provisions of cll 6 and 7 of the SBA.\n101 It is true that the word \"assets\" in the first sentence of cl 5.4 must be read as a reference to the \"assets purchased.\n\" However the reservation of title in cl 5.4 is in my view to be contrasted with cl 6 under which property in the assets purchased did not pass until payment of the final instalment of the purchase price.\n102 It seems to me that cl 5.4 is concerned with the subject matter of cl 7.\nUnder that clause, Cairnsmore obtained possession of the assets purchased on payment of the first instalment of the purchase price.\nWhat Bearsden obtained under cl5.4 was a power to take back Cairnsmore's right to possession at any time by exercising Bearsden's right of title.\n103 In my view, Bearsden exercised its right of title when Mr Hodge gave notice to the clients on 31 March 2005.\nIt is difficult to understand what else was intended by those letters.\n104 Moreover, Mr Hodge acknowledged in cross-examination that since at least May 2005, all of the clients the subject of the SBA remained with him.\nBearsden or Mr Hodge had possession of the clients and the client files.\nBearsden obtained the economic benefit of the fee income generated by advice provided by Mr Hodge as an authorised representative of Paragem.\n105 It follows from cl 5.4 that Bearsden was bound to refund to Cairnsmore the first instalment of the purchase price.\n106 Clause 5.4 says nothing of any entitlement of Bearsden to recover the fees paid to Cairnsmore prior to the exercise of title.\nIn my view, Bearsden was not entitled to recover those fees either under cl 5.4 or under general principles.\n107 This was a contract for the payment of the purchase price by instalments.\nIt is well established that a purchaser is entitled to recover the instalments other than the deposit where the contract is not completed: McDonald v Dennys Lascelles at 477 to 478.\n108 Furthermore, a termination for breach is not a rescission ab initio .\nBoth parties are discharged from further performance but rights which have been unconditionally acquired are not divested: McDonald v Dennys Lascelles at 476 to 477.\nIt follows in my view that the fees paid to Cairnsmore were irrecoverable under this principle.\n109 The meaning of cl 9.1 is not entirely clear, however at very least the clause provides a \"warranty\" that Cairnsmore will not suffer an economic disadvantage by reason of any change of the identity of the AFS licensee from GPL to another entity.\n110 Counsel for Cairnsmore devoted a great deal of attention to this issue.\nA large number of reasons were put forward to support a finding that Cairnsmore did suffer a disadvantage by reason of the move to Paragem.\n111 I am satisfied that Cairnsmore did suffer a disadvantage for two principal reasons.\nFirst, the conditions of Paragem's licence were more restricted than those of GPL.\nThere were areas of business open to GPL that could not be undertaken by Paragem.\nOne of these was life insurance.\nMr Howland was interested in this area of practice and Mr Hodge conceded that some of the clients wanted this product.\n112 The second disadvantage was the \"dealer fee\" or commission payable to the AFS licence holder.\nI am satisfied on the evidence before me that the fee payable by HBN to GPL at the time of the move to Paragem was 9.11 per cent.\nI reject Mr Hodge's evidence that the actual fee was 12.5 per cent and that the 9.11 per cent was explicable by reason of a volume discount.\nHis evidence on this question was unsatisfactory and was not supported by any documentary records tendered to explain the payment of 9.11 per cent commission.\n113 Nor was the fee payable to Paragem explained by any proper documentary evidence.\nPlainly it was not the 8.3 per cent referred to in Annexure B to the SBA.\nMr Knox gave evidence that it was \"net 10 per cent\" fee.\nHowever, Mr Knox's explanation was not given with the clarity or directness I would have expected.\n114 In my opinion the correct analysis of Mr Knox's evidence is that the fee payable to Paragem was 15 per cent.\nThere was a separate arrangement between Paragem and Bearsden under which Bearsden obtained a five per cent rebate giving it a net 10 per cent commission payable to Paragem.\nHowever, there was nothing to suggest that the benefit of the five per cent rebate would have flowed to Cairnsmore.\n115 It follows in my view that Cairnsmore suffered an economic disadvantage by reason of the higher commission payable to Paragem.\n116 It seems to me that although cl 9.1 speaks of a \"warranty,\" it was in truth a condition of the SBA that Cairnsmore would not suffer a disadvantage: see Tramways Advertising Pty Ltd v Luna Park (NSW) Ltd (1938) 39 SR (NSW) 632 at 641-642.\n117 This view is supported by the object and purpose of the SBA and the surrounding circumstances, including GPL's standing as a premium dealer and Mr Howland's concerns that he be protected against a move from GPL.\n118 Accordingly, in my view Cairnsmore is entitled to terminate for breach of cl 9.1.\n119 In McRae , the plaintiffs recovered damages for the agreed purchase price together with the expenditure wasted in reliance on the promise that there was oil tanker in the locality of the reef.\nThe wasted expenditure fell within the second rule in Hadley v Baxendale (1854) 9 Ex 341: see McRae at 413-415; see also The Commonwealth v Amman Aviation Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 54 ; (1991) 174 CLR 64 at 88-89.\n120 There may be some differences from McRae in the present case; in particular, a question arises as to whether it was impossible for Cairnsmore to establish what its profits would have been under the SBA: see Amman at 89.\nHowever, I am inclined to the view that the difficulties which arose from the move to Paragem tend in favour of the application of the wasted expenditure principle to the facts of this case.\n121 The question then becomes whether the wasted expenditure exceeded the amount of $194,000 received by Cairnsmore during the life of the SBA.\nThe parties put forward a schedule of losses and there was an argument as to whether some of them fell within the wasted expenditure principle.\n &#8226; monthly cost allocation of $5800;\n &#8226; stamp duty on the SBA;\n &#8226; loan establishment fee;\n &#8226; life insurance premiums paid as a condition of Cairnsmore's loan;\n &#8226; interest on the loan.\nThe total amount of the expenditure was approximately $170,000 which is approximately $24,000 less than the amount of fees paid to Cairnsmore.\n122 However, the short answer to this difficulty is that under cl 28.2 of the SBA, Bearsden indemnified Cairnsmore against all losses, costs, liability and expenses incurred by Cairnsmore because of a breach by Bearsden or because something was not as it was represented to be.\n123 It follows from this that Cairnsmore is entitled to recover all of its claimed expenditure, other than the amount paid to obtain Mr Howland's PS 146 qualification and the income tax.\n124 The total of the items recoverable under cl 28.2 exceeds the sum of $194,000.\n125 The same amount is recoverable under s 82 of the Trade Practices Act : see I &amp; L Securities Pty Limited v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Limited [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 at [50] .\nThose damages are recoverable by Cairnsmore and Mr Howland against Bearsden.\nIt is clear that the representations were made in trade or commerce and that reliance was established.\n126 I will deal below with the question of the personal claim against Mr Hodge.\n127 The representations made by Bearsden and Mr Hodge as to Bearsden's title to sell the business were eventually admitted.\nThe admission was that oral and written submissions were made by Mr Hodge as second respondent, including on behalf of Bearsden, in terms of recitals A and B, cll 5.4, 6, 7, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 9.1, 9.2, 15.2, 19.1, 20, 24 and 25 of the SBA.\n128 The question which arises is whether s 52 of the Trade Practices Act applies to Mr Hodge by reason of the extended operation of that provision to individuals under s 6(3) of the Trade Practices Act .\n129 Alternatively, Mr Hodge will be liable if he was involved in the contravention under s 75B of the Trade Practices Act .\n130 All of the relevant representations which were the subject of the admission were made not only in the SBA but in the draft of that document which was sent by Mr Hodge to Mr Howland by email on 17 June 2004.\n131 It follows that Mr Hodge's conduct involved the use of postal, telegraphic or telephonic services under s 6(3) of the Trade Practices Act .\nAccordingly, s 52 applied to Mr Hodge and he is personally liable for the damages suffered by Cairnsmore and Mr Howland by that conduct.\n132 It is therefore unnecessary to determine whether Mr Hodge is also liable under s75B , but I will do so briefly.\n133 Whether Mr Hodge is liable as a person involved in a contravention turns on whether he had knowledge of the essential elements of the contravention: see York v Lucas [1985] HCA 65 ; (1983) 158 CLR 661.\n134 There has been some debate in the cases as to whether liability under s 75B requires the accessory to know that the conduct of the principal is misleading or deceptive: see for example Medical Benefits Fund of Australia Ltd v Cassidy [2003] FCAFC 289 ; (2003) 135 FCR 1 at [83] .\n135 The question in the present case turns on Mr Hodge's knowledge.\n136 Mr Hodge was an unsatisfactory witness.\nI cannot accept him as a witness of truth.\nHe either could not or would not answer questions directly.\nHe denied propositions that were put to him that were clearly supported by contemporaneous documents.\nHis denials were in the teeth of the contemporaneous documentary record.\n137 By contrast, I though that Mr Howland was a truthful witness.\nHe did not have a good recollection of the detail but he did his best to answer honestly and directly.\nI prefer his evidence where it conflicts with that of Mr Hodge.\n138 It is clear that Mr Hodge was aware of all the necessary elements.\nHe made the representations and he was aware of the structure under which the business was established.\nIn addition, the documents given to clients showed quite plainly that Mr Hodge informed them that HBN was the corporate representative of GPL and that Mr Hodge was the personal authorised representative of GPL.\n139 However, if it is necessary for me to find that Mr Hodge knew the representations as to Bearsden's title were false, a real barrier exists as to a finding under s 75B.\nThis is because I would have to find that Mr Hodge knew of the error in the SBA which was his own undoing.\nI could not make that finding notwithstanding the view I formed of Mr Hodge as an untruthful witness.\n140 Accordingly, I prefer to rest my finding against Mr Hodge on the basis of the extended operation of the Trade Practices Act under s 6(3).\n141 It is quite clear form the principles stated in McDonald v Danny Lascelles that Bearsden is not entitled to recover the second and third instalments as claimed in the cross-claim.\n142 There will be judgment for Cairnsmore and Mr Howland against Bearsden and Mr Hodge for breach of contract and damages and for damages under the Trade Practices Act .\n143 I have set out above how the amounts are to be calculated.\nInterest will be payable.\nThe parties are to bring in short minutes to effect the reasons for judgment.\n144 I have heard argument on costs.\nMs Perry, the solicitor for Cairnsmore and Mr Howland, relied firstly upon an offer of compromise dated 11 December 2006.\nThere can be no argument but that a proper exercise of my discretion in accordance with O 23 r 11(4) of the Federal Court Rules would be that Cairnsmore and Mr Howland should be entitled to costs on a party and party basis up to 28 days from 11 December 2006, with costs on an indemnity basis thereafter.\n145 However, Ms Perry also points to the provisions of cl 28.2 of the SBA.\nThis would give Cairnsmore full indemnity against all of the costs and expenses incurred by it and that seems to me to be the clear result of the contractual provisions entered into by the parties.\nI do not think that there would be any double-counting flowing from this.\nI have been referred without objection to what took place before the proceedings were actually commenced and it would appear that considerable costs were incurred when Cairnsmore and Mr Howland were represented by Minter Ellison.\nThose costs would fall within the indemnity provided under cl 28.2.\n146 It follows that I will order Bearsden to pay the costs and expenses of the proceedings incurred by Cairnsmore on an indemnity basis pursuant to cl 28.2 of the SBA.\n147 I also make a costs order in favour of Mr Howland but that costs order can only be in accordance with O 23 r 11(4) for party and party costs up to 11 January 2007.\nIndemnity costs are applicable thereafter.\nI certify that the preceding one hundred and forty-seven (147) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jacobson.\nDated: 26 November 2007\n Counsel for the Applicant: J Svehla \n Solicitor

        "description": "1 This is an appeal from a judgment of a Federal Magistrate of 24 April 2007 dismissing an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') dated 31 October 2006 handed down 1 November 2006.\nThe Tribunal had affirmed a decision of a delegate of the then Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to refuse to grant a protection visa to the appellant under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').\n2 The appellant is a citizen of the People's Republic of China ('the PRC'), who was born in 1965, arrived in Australia on 12 May 2006.\nOn 23 May 2006 the appellant lodged an application for a Protection (Class XA) Visa with the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (now the Department of Immigration and Citizenship).\nIn her protection visa application, the appellant claimed to be a Falun Gong practitioner.\nThe appellant, who claimed that her entire family were involved in Falun Gong activities, stated that in 1999 they were called into the local police station and informed by police that they should no longer practice Falun Gong and that the reason for the sudden banning was that they were only carrying out orders from their superiors.\nThe appellant claimed that when she and others continued with their practice of Falun Gong the next day, they were detained by the police, taken to the police station, charged and required to pay a heavy fine in order to be released.\nThe appellant claimed that she continued to privately practice Falun Gong, that she was later reported by an unidentified person and that she was then sent to a detention centre where she was tortured and abused.\nA delegate of the first respondent refused to grant the visa and by letter dated 30 June 2006 wrote to the appellant notifying her of the decision and of her review rights.\nOn 18 August 2006 the appellant lodged a written application dated the same day with the Tribunal for a review of that decision.\nFor reasons which I explain below this was outside the time prescribed by the Act.\n3 On the same date the Tribunal wrote to the appellant, acknowledging receipt of her application and providing information as to the future disposition of her application.\nThe appellant sent a letter on 28 August to Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs ('DIMA') in which she requested that the decision letter from DIMA be re-sent, so that she could lodge her review application to the Tribunal within time.\n4 On 1 September 2006 the Tribunal again wrote to the appellant advising her that it appeared that her application had been filed too late to be considered and stating why this was so.\nIt invited her to write to the Tribunal by 26 September 2006 if she disagreed with its view and to provide further information if she wished.\nBy written notice dated 4 September 2006 the applicant provided details of her new address.\n5 The Tribunal then wrote to the appellant at her new address on 28 September 2006, in the same terms as its earlier letter dated 1 September 2006 except that it now invited the appellant to write to the Tribunal by 24 October 2006 if she disagreed with the Tribunal's view and requested that the appellant provided further information if she wished.\nThe appellant replied to the Tribunal by letter dated 24 October 2006.\n 'I would like to explain to you that I had not received the decision letter from DIMA at all.\nI just gave them a call and they told me the application had been refused.\nI lodged my review straight away.\nI believe that I should be given another opportunity to review my application.\nThank you!\n (Transcribed from the original without alteration or amendment)\n THE DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL \n6 The Tribunal's decision was dated 31 October 2006 and sent to the appellant on 1 November 2006.\nThe Tribunal set out the relevant law in its written Statement of Decisions and Reasons to the following effect and with which I respectfully agree.\n7 The Tribunal's jurisdiction arises if a valid application is made under s 412 of the Act for review of an RRT-reviewable decision.\nA decision to refuse to grant a protection visa is an RRT reviewable decision: s 411(1)(c).\nSection 412(1)(b) requires that such an application for review must be given to the Tribunal within the prescribed time period.\n8 In respect of an applicant who has applied for review of an RRT-reviewable decision covered by s 411(1)(c) and is not in immigration detention when given notice of the delegate's decision, the application for review must be lodged at a registry of the Tribunal within a period not later than 28 days from the day on which such notice is received: s 412(1)(b) and regulation 4.31(2)(b) and (3) of the Migration Regulations 1994 ('the Regulations').\nThere is no provision for granting any extension of time for lodging such an application.\nAn application sent to the Tribunal by post or by fax is not to be taken to have been lodged until it is received at a registry of the Tribunal: r 4.31(4).\n9 The provisions relevant to this matter which deal with notification of a decision to refuse to grant a visa are contained in ss 66, 494B, 494C and 494D of the Act and r 2.16 of the Regulations.\n10 Section 66(1) provides that when the Minister grants or refuses to grant a visa, he or she is to notify the applicant of the decision in the prescribed way.\nRegulation 2.16 provides that for the purposes of s 66(1), the Minister must notify an applicant of a decision to refuse to grant a visa by one of the methods specified in s 494B.\nSection 494B specifies a number of alternative methods for giving a document required or permitted to be given by the Minister to a person.\n11 One of the methods specified in s 494B consists of the Minister dating the document and then dispatching it within 3 working days of the date of the document by prepaid post or other prepaid means to the last address for service or the last residential or business address provided to the Minister by the recipient for the purposes of receiving documents: s 494B(4).\nIf a document is given to a person by this method and the document was dispatched from a place in Australia to an address in Australia, the person is taken to have received the document 7 working days (in the place of that address) after the date of the document: s 494C(4)(a).\nThis will be so even if the document was never in fact received.\nTherefore, if the notice of a decision to refuse a visa was sent in accordance with s 494B(4), from a place in Australia to an address in Australia, the prescribed time period within which a review application must be lodged with the Tribunal commences 7 working days after the date of the notice.\n12 Section 66(2) provides that notification of a decision to refuse a visa must contain certain information about why the visa was refused and, if there is a right of review, how to apply for review of that decision.\n13 The Tribunal found, correctly, in my opinion, that the contents of the delegate's decision notification complied with the requirements of s 66(2) of the Act, and that the Department's file records indicated that the applicant did not give the Minister written notice of the name and address of her authorised recipient under s 494D of the Act.\nThe Tribunal found that the decision notification letter, which was dated 30 June 2006, was sent by prepaid post on 30 June 2006 from a place in Australia to the applicant's address in Australia, which was provided by the appellant to the Minister for the purposes of her receiving documents.\n14 The Tribunal further found that the decision notification letter, which was dispatched within 3 working days of the date of the letter to the applicant's correct address, was in accordance with s 494B(4) of the Act.\nThe Tribunal noted that the notice was returned to the Department unclaimed and that the applicant was taken to have received the notice on 11 July 2006, being 7 working days after the date of the notice, despite the notice being returned unclaimed.\n15 The Tribunal found that the appellant sought review of the decision of the delegate under s 411(1)(c) and that the 28 day prescribed period provided under s 412(1)(b) and r 4.31(2)(b) applied.\nTherefore, given the Tribunal's findings regarding when the applicant was taken to have been notified of the decision of the delegate and the applicable prescribed period, the Tribunal found that the last day on which the application for review could be lodged was 8 August 2006.\nThe application for review was not received by the Tribunal until 18 August 2006, after the prescribed period had expired.\n16 The appellant stated in her submission of 24 October 2006 that she \"had not received the decision letter from DIMA at all\" and that she \"just gave them a call\" and they told her that her \"application had been refused.\n\" However, as the decision notification letter was sent to the address provided to the Minister by the recipient, for the purpose of receiving documents under s 494B(4) of the Act, the appellant was taken to have received the document 7 working days after the date of the document in accordance with s 494C(4)(a), even if the document was never actually received by the appellant.\n17 As the application for review was received by the Tribunal outside the mandatory time period, the Tribunal found that it was not a valid application and that it had no jurisdiction to review the decision of the delegate.\n18 On 9 March 2007 the appellant filed an amended application for judicial review of the decision of the Tribunal.\n 1.\nDIAC failed to notify me the decision for my application for a protection visa.\nFrom the record of DIAC, the decision letter was return to DIAC unreceived.\n 2.\nDIAC failed to notify me the decision, I lost the opportunity to have my application reviewed at RRT.\n 3.\nDIA should resend the decision letter to me and my application should be considered at RRT.\n (Transcribed from the original without alteration or amendment).\n THE DECISION OF THE FEDERAL MAGISTRATE \n19 Before the Federal Magistrate, the appellant relied on her amended application filed on 9 March 2007, and her affidavit which accompanied her original application.\nIn her amended application, the appellant asserted that the Minister's Department failed to notify her of the delegate's decision against which she was seeking review by the Tribunal, and that she should receive a fresh notification letter.\n20 The Federal Magistrate, who received as evidence the court book filed on 22 January 2007, observed that a letter dated 30 June 2006 was sent by the Minister's Department to the appellant which notified her of the delegate's decision.\nThe letter was sent by registered post and was addressed to the applicant at her address for service disclosed in her protection visa application.\nThe Federal Magistrate further observed that on the face of the letter was a handwritten notation stating \"sent 30/6/06\", which he concluded was evidence that the letter was despatched on the same date that it bore.\nThe Federal Magistrate stated that the Department's letter was returned unclaimed, as indicated by an Australia Post sticker, and that the return notification was dated 4 July.\n21 The Federal Magistrate found that the Department's letter, sent 30 June 2006, must have been despatched within three working days of the date that it bore.\nHis Honour noted that the appellant conceded this in her letter appearing in the court book, and found that the Department met the requirements for effective notification of the delegate's decision.\nIn these circumstances, it was held in effect, that the period of 28 days within which the application for review required to be given to the Tribunal [s 412(1)(b) and regulation 4.31(2)(b)] commenced on the 11 July being the date on which the appellant was deemed to have received the Department's notification of decision dated 30 June 2006.\n22 The Federal Magistrate held that as the appellant had not given the Tribunal her review application within the prescribed period, her application was incompetent and that the Tribunal was correct in finding that it did not have jurisdiction to deal with the appellant's review application.\n23 After outlining the relevant statutory requirements, the Federal Magistrate determined that the Tribunal was correct in finding that that it had no jurisdiction and consequently that there was no jurisdictional error in the decision of the Tribunal.\n24 The Federal Magistrate correctly held that the decision of the Tribunal was a privative clause decision and that the application to the Federal Magistrates Court must be dismissed.\n25 The Notice of Appeal filed by the appellant on 15 May 2007 was accompanied by an affidavit sworn by the appellant.\nThe Notice of Appeal contains two grounds of appeal which in substance repeat the grounds before the Federal Magistrate.\n '1.\nDepartment of Immigration and Citizenship failed to notify me the decision of my application for a protection visa.\nI was not notified the decision in writing.\n 2.\nThe Tribunal refused to accept my application because of the jurisdictional errors made by DIAC.\n (Transcribed from the original without alteration or amendment).\n THE APPELLANT'S SUBMISSIONS \n26 At hearing of the appeal before me the appellant simply reiterated her complaint that she never received the letter of 30 June 2006 from the delegate of the first respondent notifying its decision.\n27 I have outlined the grounds of appeal above.\nThe issue on appeal is whether there was any relevant error on the part of the Federal Magistrate in dismissing the appellant's application.\n28 As the Federal Magistrate correctly observed the making of an application within the prescribed time is an essential preliminary to the exercise of the Tribunal's jurisdiction: Fernando v Minister for Immigration [2000] FCA 324 and further that the Tribunal did not have the power to override the time limitations prescribed by s 412(1)(b) of the Act: VEAN of 2002 v Minister for Immigration [2003] FCAFC 311.\n29 The appellant asserts she did not in fact receive the letter of 30 June 2006 containing notification of the delegate's decision.\nDespite the fact that she, at that time, lived at the address to which the letter was sent the letter was returned marked \"return to sender\" on 4 July 2007 (see CB 44).\nHowever, this does not affect the operation of s 494C of the Act: Murphy v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 657 ; (2004) 135 FCR 550 per Spender J at [69], which was followed by the Full Federal Court in Xie v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 172 at [14] .\n30 Further, a case such as this has not been affected by the recent Full Federal Court decision in Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZKKC [2007] FCAFC 105 , which considered s 477 of the Act and the time limits for judicial review applications in the Federal Magistrates Court.\nThat decision is to be distinguished from the present case, which turns significantly on the terms of s 412 of the Act which provides for deemed notification whereas actual notification is required under s 477 of the Act.\n31 It is, in my opinion, regrettable that there exists no power in the Court to extend the time for bringing such an application.\nThe evidence of the appellant is that at the date (between 30 June and 4 July 2006) when the notification of the Minister's decision was sent and returned marked \"Left Address/Unknown\" she was in fact still at the address to which the letter was addressed.\nThis fact does not appear to have been disputed by the first respondent.\nNo explanation has been given, as to why the registered post was marked \"Left Address/Unknown\", despite the appellant remaining at that address.\nOne possible reason is the need for a registered letter to be signed for and perhaps the applicant was not at home when the postal officer attended at her address.\n32 This lack of power in the Court has the capacity to work an injustice upon an application for judicial review.\nSuch indeed may well be the case here.\nFor my part it gives serious cause for concern and should be reviewed by the legislature.\nIn comparison, as I have noted, a Federal Magistrate has discretionary power under s 477 of the Act to grant an extension of time in certain circumstances where an application is made for a remedy to be granted in exercise of the Court's original jurisdiction under s 476 of the Act.\n33 I have carefully considered the findings and reasons of the Tribunal and those of the Federal Magistrate, in the light of the appellant's grounds of appeal.\nI am satisfied that no relevant error has been established.\nIn my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.\nI certify that the preceding thirty-three (33) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Gilmour.\nDated: 8 August 2007\n The Appellant represented herself: \n Counsel for the Respondent: Ms V McWilliam \n Solicitor for the Respondent: DLA Phillips Fox \n

        "description": "On 13 March 2009, I made findings that the respondents had each contravened s 43 of the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (Cth) (\"the BCII\") in two respects: Williams v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2009] FCA 223.\nI have now heard the parties on the final orders which should be made, and on the question of costs.\nThese reasons deal with those matters.\nThey should be read together with my reasons of 13 March 2009.\nThe first matter concerns the penalties, if any, which should be imposed on the respondents for the contraventions to which I have referred.\nThere were two such contraventions.\nFirst, I found that the respondents had procured a stoppage of work on the site on 31 July 2006 with intent to coerce Kane to employ a person as a building employee, or to engage a person as a building contractor, in the role of a labourer with occupational health and safety responsibilities and as a peggy on site.\nSecondly, I held that the respondents had threatened to procure further stoppages on the site with the same intent.\nEach contravention is such as would attract a maximum penalty of $110,000 in the case of the first respondent, the Union, and $22,000 in the case of the second respondent, Mr Mates.\nThe task of the court is \"to fix a penalty which pays appropriate regard to the circumstances in which the contraventions have occurred and the need to sustain public confidence in the statutory regime which imposes the obligations\": Australian Ophthalmic Supplies Pty Ltd v McAlary-Smith [2008] FCAFC 8 ; (2008) 165 FCR 560 , 580 [91] per Buchanan J.\nThe conduct of the respondents on 31 July 2006 was, in my view, squarely within the general class of conduct with which s 43(1) of the BCII Act is, as a matter of policy, concerned.\nMr Mates (in his role as a representative of the Union) visited the site and procured a stoppage of work in circumstances where, as would have been apparent to him, important construction work was interrupted.\nHe did so with the intent of coercing Kane in the respects indicated above.\nHe was acting in the course of his employment as an organiser of the Union, and there was no suggestion in the evidence that the Union disapproved of his actions.\nCounsel for the respondents submitted that the contraventions found to have occurred in this case should be regarded as towards the less serious end of the spectrum.\nFirst, it was said that there was no extreme or reprehensible industrial conduct (such as violence, damage to property, or the like) involved here.\nI accept that there was no such conduct, but its absence does not, in my view, justify the placement of the contraventions at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness.\nEven absent such conduct, the present contraventions remain, as I have said, squarely within the range of conduct which it is the concern of s 43 to proscribe.\nSecondly, it was said that, subjectively, Mr Mates' concern was with the health and safety of the workers on the site, and that his insistence on the employment of a labourer was his way of ensuring that the deficiencies in the condition of the site, as he perceived them, were addressed.\nIt was put that these factors were mitigatory, or at least should set the case apart from one in which the employment of additional labour was demanded with no colourable justification.\nCounsel for the applicant submitted that the respondents' submissions failed to recognise the essence of Mr Mates' wrongdoing, which was that, however strongly-felt were his reservations about the condition of the site, he sought to rectify the matter by recourse to coercion.\nI think there is some substance in each of these submissions, the difference between them being a matter of perspective.\nIt is, of course, not only legitimate but important that union officials in the building industry maintain a concern with on-site health and safety.\nThe BCII Act itself recognises the importance of the subject, but it does so in a limited way: a stoppage of work on account of a worker's reasonable concern about an imminent risk to his or her health or safety is excluded from the definition of \"building industrial action\" under Ch 5 of the Act, but there is no corresponding exclusion from the operation of s 43.\nI consider that the explanation for the difference is to be found in the circumstance that s 43 is concerned only with action taken with a particular intent.\nIf someone in the position of Mr Mates took action with the intent only of protecting his or her members from exposure to an imminent risk to their health or safety, the section would not have been contravened.\nBut that was not the present case.\nI have held, in effect, that Mr Mates did not have reasonable grounds to suppose that the workers on site could only be protected by a cessation of work.\nIndeed, in procuring a stoppage of work, Mr Mates' intent was to coerce Kane.\nWhile I recognise the importance of a workplace which is safe and without risks to health, I consider it no less important that such issues, when they arise and become matters of controversy, be resolved according to procedures established for the purpose (as existed in the present case).\nThus I substantially accept the case put on behalf of the applicant that Mr Mates had no need to procure a stoppage of work on 31 July 2006 even if he did hold the concerns that he expressed in his evidence, and that the source of those concerns should not be regarded as mitigatory apropos the inherent seriousness of his conduct.\nThirdly, it was said on behalf of the respondents that the work stoppage on the site was of short duration and that there was no evidence of any loss having been sustained by Kane as a result.\nIt seems that work did not resume on the site until 2 August 2006, and that two days' work (save for the unloading of the steel) were lost.\nThere was no evidence that any person suffered financial loss as a result of the stoppage.\nMr Chambers gave evidence that the client would not \"pursue\" Kane for any losses resulting from the stoppage.\nIn the circumstances, I do not consider that the seriousness of the stoppage, or the losses arising from it, should be regarded as aggravating factors in the fixing of penalties.\nOn the other hand, I would not regard the absence of evidence of loss as mitigatory.\nThe work scheduled to be done on 31 July 2006 was the erection of structural steel and would, to someone in the position of Mr Mates, have appeared to be on the critical path (which it was).\nI am not prepared to depreciate the inherent significant of the stoppage --- as a means of placing illegitimate pressure on Kane --- by reason only that there was no evidence of any resulting financial loss.\nCounsel for the respondents made a number of other points in his very comprehensive submissions, but they were, if I may so observe with respect to him, based on isolated observations by Judges in individual cases, each concerned with its own facts.\nWhile I have considered them, I do not propose to rehearse them in these reasons as they do not, in my view, affect what would otherwise be the appropriate penalties to be fixed in the present case.\nThe next submission by counsel for the respondents concerned the inter-relationship between the two contraventions (the stoppage and the threat) which have been found in the case of each of the respondents.\nIt was submitted that the second contravention in each case should not be separately penalised, on the basis that what was involved here was a single \"course of conduct\", relying in this respect upon the discussion of the subject in the joint reasons of Stone and Buchanan JJ in Mornington Inn Pty Ltd v Jordan [2008] FCAFC 70 ; (2008) 168 FCR 383 , 396-401, [41]-[58].\n The appellant argued, however, that 'Mr Barry engaged in one multifaceted course of applying duress to bring about the signing of the AWA' so far as Ms Thompson was concerned.\n'Where there are truly two or more incursions into criminal conduct, consecutive sentences will generally be appropriate.\nWhere, whatever the number of technically identifiable offences committed, the prisoner was truly engaged upon one multi-faceted course of criminal conduct, the judge is likely to find concurrent sentences just and convenient.\nAlthough, factually, Mr Mates was in a sense engaged in a single course of conduct on 31 July 2006, that conduct had two elements which s 43 recognises as separate and which were, qualitatively, distinct in the impact they may be presumed to have had on Kane.\nThat is to say, Mr Mates sought to coerce Kane in two ways.\nBy procuring stoppage of work he placed immediate pressure upon Kane and, necessarily, demonstrated his capacity and preparedness to do so.\nBy threatening to procure later stoppages, he asserted, in effect, control over when work would resume on the site, and in what circumstances.\nIn its coercive effect, the threat should be viewed as additional to, and not merely as a continuation of, the conduct involved in procuring the stoppage as such.\nThe next matter for consideration is the relevance of prior contraventions of s 43 or of similar statutory proscriptions.\nCounsel for the applicant drew the court's attention to a number of previous occasions upon which the Union (and in one case Mr Mates) had been found to have contravened s 43, or another provision, of the BCII Act, or a provision of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) (\"the WR Act\") which, according to counsel, proscribed similar conduct to that proscribed by s 43.\n January/February 1999 Contravention of s 298P(3) of the WR Act: Hamberger v CFMEU (2000) 103 IR 249.\n November 2002 Contravention of s 298P(3) of the WR Act: Hadgkiss v Blevin [2004] FCA 697.\nApril 2003 Contravention of s 170NC of the WR Act: Alfred v Walter Construction Group Limited [2005] FCA 497.\nAugust 2003 Contravention of s 187AB(1)(a) and (b) of the WR Act: Cruse v Multiplex Limited [2007] FCA 2015 , and on appeal [2008] FCAFC 179.\nAugust 2003 Contravention of s 187AB(1)(a) and (b) of the WR Act: Ponzio v B &amp; P Caelli Construction Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1221 , and on appeal [2007] FCAFC 65 ; (2007) 158 FCR 543.\nOctober 2003 Contravention of s 170 NC of the WR Act (and s 45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth)): A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v CFMEU [2007] FCA 1047.\nMay 2004: Contravention of s 187AB(1)(a) and (b) of the WR Act: Cahill v CFMEU [2008] FCA 495.\nOctober 2004: Contravention of s 170NC of the WR Act: Martino v CFMEU and Maher (unreported, Magistrates Court of Victoria, 10 May 2006).\nMay 2005: Contravention of s 298SC(c), and s 170NC, of the WR Act: Cruse v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1267.\nOctober 2005: Contravention of ss 38 and 43 of the BCII Act: Stuart-Mahoney v CFMEU [2008] FCA 1426.\nFebruary 2006: Contravention of s 43 of the BCII Act: Cahill v CFMEU (No 3) [2009] FCA 52.\nIn each of the above instances, the Union was found to have contravened the provision or provisions referred to.\nIn addition, in the most recent instance (that of February 2006), Mr Mates was found to have contravened the provision referred to.\n(a) Is the court either entitled or obliged to have regard to prior contraventions at all, and if so, for what purpose?\n(b) In the case of contraventions of provisions other than s 43 of the BCII Act, are those contraventions relevant to the consideration of penalties in the present case, which involved contraventions of that section?\n(c) Is it proper to have regard to previous contraventions found to have occurred in States or Territories other than Victoria, where the contraventions in the present case did occur?\n(d) May the court have regard to contraventions which occurred prior to 31 July 2006 (when the contraventions in the present case occurred), or is the court limited to contraventions in relation to which findings had been recorded before that date?\n There are two subsidiary principles which should be mentioned.\nThe first is that the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence.\nTo do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences: Director of Public Prosecutions v Ottewell [1970] AC 642 at 650.\nThe antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law.\nIn the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted.\nIt is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.\nCounsel for the applicant submitted that antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a prisoner's claim for leniency.\nThat is not and has never been the approach of the courts in this country and it would be at odds with the community's understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalties.\nThat is to say, subject to the maintenance of proportionality, prior contraventions should be regarded as relevant to the extent that they show that the instant contravention is \"an uncharacteristic aberration\" or whether, by contrast, they show that that contravention manifests \"a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law\".\n In relation to the first defendant, the schedule refers to eight proceedings against the first defendant between 2000 and 2006.\nThe contraventions established in those proceedings are of a different nature than the contraventions now being considered and did not involve contraventions of the Act.\nIn Construction, Forestry, Mining &amp; Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231 at 232 Branson J listed a number of matters that are relevant to penalty in relation to contraventions under Pt XA of the WR Act.\nOne matter her Honour considered was whether the respondent had previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of Pt XA of that Act.\nIn my view, that is the correct approach.\nIt is not appropriate to consider all contraventions of any industrial legislation by any Branch of the first defendant anywhere in Australia.\nThe first defendant is a very large organisation that operates throughout Australia.\nBranches, Divisions, officers and representatives of the first defendant are involved in dealings with employers in relation to industrial matters every day.\nIt is inappropriate to take account of conduct of the first defendant through various Branches, Divisions and officers or representatives that is of a different character than the contravening conduct in question and are contraventions of different legislation.\nIt was said that the following passage from the judgment of Tracey J in Stuart-Mahoney v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 1426 , [44] was authority for much the same proposition:\n This consideration is derived from the decision of Branson J in Coal &amp; Allied Operations.\nIn the present case, the applicant invites the Court to have regard to previous contraventions by the CFMEU of the WR Act in determining the appropriate penalty for the CFMEU's contraventions of the BCII Act.\nSimilar previous conduct demonstrates that the respondent has a history of engaging in the particular conduct in question, that the penalties previously imposed were insufficient to deter the respondent from re-engaging in that conduct and that the respondent has failed to take adequate steps to prevent further contraventions.\nConduct which is of a different character does not assist this assessment see: Leighton Contractors Pty Ltd v Constructions, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2006] WASC 317 ; (2006) 164 IR 375 at [67] .\nSimilar conduct which has been found to contravene other legislative provisions will have potential relevance.\nIn this case, any previous contraventions of the provisions of Part 9 of the WR Act which relate to unlawful industrial action and coercion are relevant in determining the appropriate penalty.\nBoth Tracey J and Le Miere J referred to the judgment of Branson J in Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union v Coal &amp; Allied Operations Pty Ltd (No 2) [1999] FCA 1714 ; (1999) 94 IR 231.\n The following matters, which are not intended to comprise an exhaustive list, seem to me to be considerations to which the Court may appropriately have regard in determining whether particular conduct calls for the imposition of a penalty, and assuming that it does, the amount of the penalty: \n (a) The circumstances in which the relevant conduct took place (including whether the conduct was undertaken in deliberate defiance or disregard of the Act).\n(b) Whether the respondent has previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of PtXA of the Act.\n(c) Where more than one contravention of PtXA is involved, whether the various contraventions are properly seen as distinct or whether they arise out of the one course of conduct.\n(d) The consequences of the conduct found to be in contravention of PtXA of the Act.\n(e) The need, in the circumstances, for the protection of industrial freedom of association.\n(f) The need, in the circumstances, for deterrence.\n There are, in my view, several difficulties with the approach for which the respondents contend in the present case.\nInsofar as they rely upon Coal &amp; Allied , it is clear that the considerations referred to by Branson J were not intended to be exclusive.\nHer Honour's judgment could not, in my view, be read as implying that contraventions arising otherwise than under the particular Part of the Act in question might not, in appropriate circumstances, be relevant to penalties.\nThe second difficulty relates to the extract set out above from Leighton Contractors .\nThere, Le Miere J expressed his views rather categorically, and in terms with which, with respect, it would be difficult to disagree.\nI would accept that it would not be appropriate to consider all contraventions of any industrial legislation, including contraventions which were of a character quite different from those presently under consideration.\nFor example, under s 230(2) of Schedule 1 to the WR Act, a registered organisation must, within 28 days after a person becomes a member of the organisation, enter that person's name and postal address in the register of members.\nThat is a civil penalty provision, contravention of which exposes the organisation to a maximum penalty of 100 penalty units: see s 306(1) of the Schedule.\nOne can readily appreciate why such contraventions, for instance, ought not normally to be taken into account for the purposes of fixing a penalty for a contravention of s 43 of the BCII Act.\nThe reason is obvious: they would be irrelevant to the matters which, according to the judgment of the High Court in Veen , might appropriately guide the exercise of the court's discretion.\nThere is, however, no reason, in point of principle or of policy, why contraventions, of themselves having the potential \"to show whether the instant [contravention] is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the [respondent] has manifested in his commission of the instant [contravention] a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law\", should be excluded from consideration simply because they arose under legislation different from that presently before the court.\nWhat is important, in my view, is the quality of the conduct in each case, and the relevance of the conduct to the norms of industrial behaviour which the instant legislation seeks to establish or support.\nIn this respect I agree with the views expressed by Tracey J in Stuart-Mahoney .\nIn the present case, the prior contraventions on which the applicant relies are those of ss 38 and 43 of the BCII Act, and of ss 170NC, 298P(3) and 187AB of the WR Act (as those provisions were numbered at the relevant times).\nEach of those provisions of the WR Act was concerned with resort to coercion to compel another person to act in a way which was, presumptively, against his or her own interests and which, necessarily, involved an outcome which the legislative provision in question viewed with disfavour.\nThere is, in my opinion, a close similarity between these provisions and the one with which I am presently concerned.\nContraventions of the former should not be excluded from present consideration simply on the ground that they arose under legislation different from that now before the court.\nTurning to the third question, counsel for the respondents submitted that \"prior contraventions of another autonomous division and/or branch of the first respondent should not be taken into account\".\n The respondents submitted that in a large organisation such as the CFMEU, with autonomous state branches, it is not necessarily appropriate to treat conduct by all branches throughout the country as relevant past conduct for the purpose of fixing a penalty in connection with the unlawful conduct of one branch.\nThere is substance in that submission.\nWhether previous misconduct is relevant to fixing a penalty is a question of logic.\nIn some cases a pattern of conduct across the country may suggest a nationwide plan of action or a national culture of misconduct.\nIn other cases it may appear that a particular branch or geographical region has acted alone in adopting a plan of action or has developed a particular culture.\nOn the other hand, counsel for the applicant drew my attention to the following passage in the judgment of Gyles J in A &amp; L Silvestri Pty Ltd v Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union [2008] FCA 466 , [13]:\n Ultimately, union officials will act in accordance with the policies of the union.\nAn official of one geographic or industry branch will observe the manner in which policies are applied by the federal body in relation to other branches.\nThese various cases illustrate that the federal body has not been effective in ensuring that officials act in accordance with the law.\nI note that there is no evidence of offending officials (including Lane) suffering any serious disciplinary penalties.\nWhile I agree with Dowsett J that the question whether previous misconduct is relevant to fixing a penalty is a question of logic, to the extent that his Honour's judgment is to be read as suggesting that conduct of the officials of another division or branch should be regarded as relevant only where there was \"a nationwide plan of action or a national culture of misconduct\", or that such conduct should never be regarded as relevant where the other division or branch \"has acted alone in adopting a plan of action or has developed a particular culture\", I would not, with respect, accept either such limitation.\nFor reasons which follow, I am attracted to the approach taken by Gyles J in Silvestri .\nThe starting point, of course, is that an organisation registered under the WR Act is a single incorporated body, present wherever it has divisions, branches or other internal components.\nIn a case such as the present, where the unlawful acts in question are the direct doing of an employed organiser acting within the scope of his or her employment, the organisation would be responsible therefor according to normal principles.\nWhere the BCII Act applies, the situation is covered also by s 69, which attributes to the building association itself the conduct of the employee.\nIn the present case it was uncontroversial that s 69 had the effect of making Mr Mates' conduct also the conduct of the Union.\nNeither was it submitted that the Union itself was not appropriately regarded as the relevant actor in each of the circumstances in which a prior contravention is now relied on by the applicant, whether or not a provision such as s 69 then applied (which it did: see the provision which is now s 826 of the WR Act).\nTurning specifically to the matter of the relevance of prior contraventions, the basic question is whether they have the potential to which I referred in par 16 above.\nIn the context of a corporate respondent with a presence in different States, I consider it to be almost self-evident that prior contraventions in State A have at least the potential to answer in the negative the question whether a particular contravention in State B is an uncharacteristic aberration.\nIt may be aberrant of the officials in State B, but it need not be aberrant of the corporation itself.\nBoth the BCII Act and the WR Act are relevantly concerned with the conduct of organisations, and I consider that the deterrent effect of a penalty would be significantly compromised if the court were obliged to turn a blind eye to a prior contravention merely because it occurred in a different division or branch of an organisation.\nThe respondents' case on this question was based on the proposition, said to be apparent from the rules of the Union, that the Union consisted of a series of autonomous divisions and branches.\nI shall turn to a consideration of the correctness of that proposition in a moment, but, assuming it to be correct, I do not accept that it follows that prior contraventions by the Union through the agency of one division or branch should never be regarded as relevant to the fixing of a penalty for unlawful conduct by the Union done through the agency of another division or branch.\nHow the Union --- or any incorporated body --- organises itself internally is a matter for its own members.\nSome bodies employ a highly centralised system of control.\nOthers vest the real decision-making power in divisions, branches or, indeed, groups of members at the workplace.\nIn the latter case, however, no less than in the former, it is the body itself which acts when the internal group or individual having generic responsibility for the relevant area of activity does something with legal consequences.\nIn the case of trade unions, if ever there was any doubt about that proposition, it was laid to rest by Heatons Transport (St Helens) Ltd v Transport and General Workers' Union [1973] AC 15.\nAnd just as a union may not, by a judicious decentralisation of authority, avoid responsibility for things done by its servants or agents acting within the scope of their authority, neither, in my view, can a union (or, for that matter, any like body) by the same process render irrelevant to the matter of fixing penalties its own prior contraventions merely by reason that they were committed in some other section, division or branch of the larger body.\nAs it happens, the contention that the prior contraventions on which the applicant relies were done in compartments of the Union which were truly autonomous (in the presently relevant sense that I should regard the Union itself as being effectively powerless in the matter) does not withstand examination.\nUnder the rules of the Union, the primary basis of association is that of membership of the Union itself.\nWithin the Union, both divisions and branches are established.\nThe divisions are established \"on a basis of industry or occupation\", and each division is to have branches \"along a geographic, occupational or area basis\" which are called \"divisional branches\".\nAll of the prior contraventions which are presently relevant were committed within the Construction and General Division of the Union.\nThat division has divisional branches in all the States, and in the Australian Capital Territory.\nThe conduct of Mr Mates in the present case occurred in Victoria.\nOf the previous contraventions listed in par 11 above, one ( Hamberger ) was committed in Queensland, four ( Alfred v CFMEU, Hadgkiss , Walker Constructio n and Silvestri ) were committed in New South Wales, and the balance were committed in Victoria.\nPresumably the individual actors involved in each case were employees, officials or members of the Union within the relevant divisional branch of the Construction and General Division.\nUnder the rules of the Union, the \"supreme governing body\" of the Union is the biennial National Conference.\nSubject thereto, there is a National Executive which has the \"care, control, superintendence, management and administration in all respects of the affairs, business, national funds and property of the Union\".\nAnd there is a National Executive Committee which has like powers, subject to the National Executive.\nNotwithstanding these provisions, it is provided that each division \"shall have autonomy to decide matters which do not directly affect the members of another division\", with respect to, amongst other things, \"the industrial interests of its members\".\nHowever, my attention was drawn to no rule which gave the divisional branches of the Construction and General Division autonomy within that division.\nIndeed, the rules of the division provide that \"the supreme governing body of the Division shall be the Divisional Conference\", and that \"all divisional branches ... shall for all purposes be and remain an inseparable part of the division by which they are established\".\nCounsel for the respondents relied upon a rule (in the rules of the Union) which, he submitted, had the effect of giving branches of the Union control over the investment and disposition of moneys received by them which is independent of other organs within the Union.\nI accept that to be so, but the rule in question is concerned with branches as such, which appear to be different from divisional branches.\nFurther, the existence of local control over property and funds does not, in my view, compel the conclusion that the industrial conduct of members attached to those branches is not still the conduct of the organisation itself, and conduct for which the organisation should bear responsibility when the stage arrives that prior contraventions are being taken into account.\nHowever that aspect may be, at least on the industrial axis, there seems to be little or no autonomy for the divisional branches of the Construction and General Division within the division itself.\nFor the above reasons, I consider that the five prior contraventions relied upon by the applicant which involved conduct in places outside Victoria are not disqualified from consideration merely by reason of that circumstance.\n The third respondent has previously been found to have engaged in conduct in contravention of s 170NC of the Act.\nThat contravention occurred on 15 October 2002.\nHowever, the relevant judgment of the District Court of New South Wales was published after the date of the conduct with which this proceeding is concerned.\nFor this reason I do not consider it appropriate to fix the amount of the penalty to be imposed on the basis that the third respondent engaged in the contravening conduct after having been found to have earlier contravened s 170NC.\nHowever, nor do I consider it appropriate to mitigate the penalty otherwise appropriate on the basis that the contravening course of conduct on the Site was an isolated instance of contravening conduct entirely uncharacteristic of the third respondent.\nIt will be seen at once that the words of Branson J give no support for the submission made on behalf of the respondents.\nHer Honour said that she would not fix a penalty on the basis that the third respondent (in that matter) \"engaged in the contravening conduct after having been found to have earlier contravened s 170NC\".\nBranson J did not say that it was inappropriate to fix the penalty on the basis that the respondent had previously engaged in conduct which contravened the section.\nThe position for which the respondents contend is contrary to the authority of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of South Australia and of the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal.\n [T]here is no rule of law which precludes a sentencing court from taking into account in an appropriate way and for appropriate purposes offences in respect of which there has been a conviction between the time of the offence for which the sentence is being imposed and the time of sentence, whether those offences have been committed before or after the current offence.\nIt will be noticed that his Honour dealt also with the situation (which is not presently relevant) in which the prior offence had been committed after the current offence.\nIt is clear that his Honour's words apply to a situation in which the prior offence occurred before the current offence, but was the subject of a conviction recorded after the commission of the current offence.\n Where the other offences have been committed before the commission of the immediate offence, their relevance is clear in the generality of cases.\nThe offender has committed the offence not as a first offender but as a person whose character is affected by previous offending.\nHe must be sentenced against the background of his record: Director of Public Prosecutions v Ottewell (1968) 52 Cr. App.\nR. 679.\nThe effect of the prior offences is more cogent if they have been the subject of conviction before the immediate offence.\nIn such cases, the offender has committed the immediate offence notwithstanding the formal judgment and condemnation of the law in respect of the earlier offences and notwithstanding the warning as to the future which the conviction experience implies.\nGiving the main judgment in McInerney with which the Chief Justice also agreed, Cox J undertook a comprehensive examination of the authorities, and concluded that the sentencing court would \"look at all relevant aspects of a defendant's behaviour up to the time when he is sentenced\" (at 121).\nIt was only a 1972 judgment of the Full Court itself --- Rainbird v Samuels (1972) 4 SASR 187 --- that cast any doubt upon that principle.\nUltimately, Cox J (with the agreement of King CJ and Bollen J) held that Rainbird v Samuels should be regarded as having been overruled.\nLikewise, in R v Aston (No 2) [1991] 1 Qd R 375 , 382, Cooper J, with the assent of the other members of the Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal, said: \"Evidence of convictions and the sentences imposed for offences committed both before and after the offence for which sentence is to be imposed is both relevant and admissible when the sentencing discretion is to be exercised.\n Counsel for the respondents also argued, in the alternative, that conduct for which a finding of a contravention had not been recorded before 31 July 2006 should be given less weight than conduct for which a finding of a contravention had been recorded before that date.\nHe relied in this respect upon the observation of King CJ in McInerney (included in the passage set out at par 27 above) that the effect of prior offences was \"more cogent\" if they had been the subject of a conviction before the commission of the immediate offence, and on the observation of Cox J in the same case (at 124) that the existence of a prior conviction \"adds a significant dimension\".\nI accept this distinction, and shall apply it in the present case.\nThe overall position with respect to the contravention of s 43 constituted by the procurement of the work stoppage on 31 July 2006, then, is this.\nThe contravention fell squarely within the range of conduct which s 43 proscribes, and had what I might call, perhaps inelegantly, a mid-range seriousness.\nThe events surrounding the contravention appear to have been unremarkable, and generally devoid of any mitigating or aggravating circumstances.\nAt the time of the contravention, the Union had previously been found to have contravened provisions of the WR Act which I accept to be relevant for present purposes on four occasions --- in Hamberger (December 2000), Alfred v CFMEU (March 2004), Hadgkiss (June 2004) and Walter Construction (May 2005).\nAt that time, the Union had in fact contravened relevant provisions on the eight further occasions mentioned on the list in par 11 above, albeit that findings were made only subsequently.\nThe impression I get from this history of contraventions is that the conduct of Mr Mates in the present case was, for the Union as contravenor, not an aberration.\nIndeed, the history tends to suggest that the Union has, with respect to anti-coercion and similar provisions of industrial laws, what the High Court in Veen described as \"a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law\".\nThe circumstances do, in my view, make specific deterrence a matter of particular importance in the fixing of a penalty in the present case.\nAll of the considerations to which I have referred in my reasons above lead me to the view that penalties of $75,000.00 and $60,000.00 would be appropriate for the Union's contraventions of s 43 constituted by the stoppage and the threat, respectively.\nI do, however, consider that a total penalty of $135,000.00 would be disproportionate in the light of the close relation between the contraventions in point of time, context and purpose.\nApplying the totality principle, I do not believe that a total penalty of more than $100,000.00 should be imposed.\nTo give effect to that principle, I propose to impose penalties on the Union of $55,000.00 and $45,000.00 respectively.\nSave with respect to prior contraventions, the reasoning set out above applies also in the case of Mr Mates.\nAs it happens, in the last matter on the list in par 11 above, a finding of three contraventions of s 43 of the BCII Act was made against Mr Mates on 5 February 2009.\nThe conduct in question occurred in February 2006.\nAlthough singular, these findings demonstrate at least that the conduct of Mr Mates on the site on 31 July 2006 was not an aberration for him.\nIn all the circumstances I consider that penalties of $11,000.00 and $9,000.00 would be appropriate for Mr Mates' contraventions of s 43 constituted by the stoppage and the threat, respectively.\nAgain, however, I consider that a total penalty of $20,000.00 would be disproportionate in the light of the close relation between the contraventions in point of time, context and purpose.\nApplying the totality principle, I do not believe that a total penalty of more than $15,000.00 should be imposed.\nTo give effect to that principle, I propose to impose penalties of $8,250.00 and $6,750.00 respectively.\nThe only remaining matter concerns the question of costs.\nThe applicant alleged four contraventions of the BCII Act, and was successful in establishing two.\nOn that basis, counsel for the respondents submitted that there should be no order as to costs.\nCounsel for the applicant submitted that it would in any event have been necessary, in order to understand the context for the purposes of deciding such issues as Mr Mates' intent, to call evidence about the whole dispute, including that which related to the events, and conversations, of 28 July 2006.\nHe sought an order for costs in favour of the applicant.\nI consider that there is substance in each of these submissions.\nIt would have been quite unrealistic to have attempted to deal with the applicant's allegations about Mr Mates' conduct on 31 July 2006 without carefully considering the lead-up events which occurred on 28 July 2006.\nOn the other hand, there were undoubtedly aspects of the proceeding which related only to allegations of wrongful conduct on 28 July as such.\nGiving appropriate credit for those respects in which the respondents succeeded, but rejecting the submissions made on their behalf that the costs of the proceeding were incurred by the parties equally with respect to the points on which they succeeded and failed, I consider that justice would be done by requiring the respondents to pay one half of the applicant's costs.\nI certify that the preceding thirty-two (32) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Jessup.\nDated: 28 May 2009\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr R Dalton \n Solicitor for the Applicant: Freehills \n Counsel for the Respondent: Mr C W Dowling \n Solicitor for the

        "description": "EDMONDS J: \n 1 This application is an appeal under s 44 of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 (Cth) from a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ('the Tribunal') affirming a decision of a delegate of the respondent refusing a claim for a pension under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (Cth) ('the Act') on the basis that the applicant is not a 'veteran' as defined in the Act.\nThe Veterans' Review Board ('the Board') had earlier affirmed the delegate's decision.\n BACKGROUND \n 2 The applicant was born on 4 February 1934.\nHe was a musician by occupation.\nHe worked as a trumpet player for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ('ABC'), commercial television channels, nightclubs, and touring artists prior to his retirement in 1996.\n3 During the Vietnam War he made four trips to that country as a musician in concert parties to entertain troops on active service.\n 1.\n2 March 1967 to 16 March 1967.\n2.\n22 December 1967 to 3 January 1968.\n3.\n23 December 1969 to 12 January 1970.\n4.\n16 September 1979 to 6 October 1970.\n 4 It is clear from evidence before the Tribunal that the applicant was paid by the Australian Army for each of these tours and that occurred at the air base in Saigon at the end of each tour, although he received allowances through the Army while he was on tour.\n5 The evidence also establishes that only one of the tours, the December 1969/January 1970 tour, was jointly sponsored by the Army and the Australian Forces Overseas Fund ('the AFOF'), but that while individual entertainers on the tour were sponsored by the AFOF, the Sydney ABC Dance Band, of which the applicant was a member, was sponsored on that tour by the Army.\nThe relevance of this evidence will become apparent below.\n THE CLAIM \n 6 On 11 November 2002, the applicant claimed a pension under the Act in respect of a medical condition suffered by him, namely psoriasis, not cirrhosis as found by the Tribunal.\nHis claim was refused by the delegate on 18 November 2002, on the ground that the applicant is not a veteran, and that decision was affirmed on review by the Board on 27 April 2005.\n7 The applicant applied to the Tribunal for review on 10 June 2005.\nThe Tribunal conducted a hearing on 3 March 2006 and gave an ex tempore decision on 6 March 2006.\nThe Tribunal concluded that the applicant is not a veteran.\n RELEVANT LEGISLATION \n 8 The word 'veteran' is defined in s 5 of the Act.\n 'The Minister may, by notice in writing published in the Gazette, make, in respect of a person, or of persons included in a class of persons, specified in the notice, all or any of the following determinations: \n (a) a determination that this Act, or specified provisions of this Act, shall apply to and in relation to the person, or a person included in that class of persons, as if he or she was, while he or she was rendering service of a kind specified in the notice (in this sub-section referred to as \"relevant service\"), a member of the Defence Force who was rendering continuous full-time service; \n (b) ...' \n 9 On 18 December 1987 the Minister made a Determination under subs 5(13)(a) in respect of inter alia : \n '(1) ... \n (2) persons who, as representatives of an approved philanthropic organisation provided welfare services to the Defence Force.\n['the Determination'].\n 10 The expression 'approved philanthropic organisation' is defined in the Determination.\nIt relevantly includes the AFOF.\n THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION \n 11 The Tribunal concluded that the evidence does not support that the applicant was a representative of the AFOF [27] after taking into account the following matters: \n &#8226; The only concert tour in which the applicant participated to which the AFOF contributed sponsorship was the December 1969 --- January 1970 concert party tour, and that was sponsored by the AFOF jointly with the Australian Army [26].\n&#8226; The applicant was paid by the Army [27].\n&#8226; The applicant did not give evidence that he was an AFOF member.\nHe did not remember going through an accreditation process to join the AFOF [27].\n&#8226; Philanthropic representatives who have served with the Australian Defence Forces ('the ADF') were part of the task force in Vietnam and their day-to-day conditions were similar to members of the ADF [28].\n&#8226; The Army holds records of representatives of approved philanthropic organisations [28].\n &#8226; The applicant is listed on the nominal roll of Vietnam Veterans, but there is no evidence to suggest he was recorded in Army records as an AFOF representative [28].\n 12 I have not been able to find any reference in the evidence to an 'honour' roll of veterans; only a 'nominal roll of Vietnam Veterans' and the applicant was certainly listed on that roll.\nThis would seem to be a case of the learned senior member misconstruing or, perhaps, misstating the evidence.\n THE SUBMISSIONS ON APPEAL \n 13 The applicant contended that the Tribunal did not offer any definition of what it considered 'representatives' to mean, as that term appeared in the Determination.\nSo much may be accepted, but that does not constitute an error of law.\nAt [25] the Tribunal did address the issue of whether the applicant is a representative of the AFOF albeit in combination with the issue of whether, as such a representative, he provided welfare services to the defence force.\n14 On the evidence referred to at [11] above, the Tribunal came to the view that the applicant is not such a 'representative' ([at 30]), and there is no basis for the view that such process of reasoning is infected by error of law.\n15 The applicant, in his written submissions, contended that 'representatives' as it appears in the Determination should be given a meaning that protects those who were in fact in a war zone and thereby exposed to the risks and circumstances associated with that war.\nIt was submitted that such a 'factual' emphasis on the meaning of representatives would accord with the beneficial nature of the Act and the Determination made under it.\nBut such a construction goes well beyond the natural and ordinary meaning of the word 'representative' as exemplified in the dictionary meanings of the word upon which the applicant himself relies.\n16 In his oral submissions, the applicant articulated what is substantively, albeit not in the same terms, a similar argument, namely that if the applicant's presence in the war zone is only explicable by reference to his participation in a concert tour co-sponsored by the AFOF and the Australian Army, then he can be a representative of the former.\nThat might be so, but such co-sponsorship will not of itself make the applicant a representative of the co-sponsor.\nIndeed, as the respondent submits, even if the applicant had been an ' AFOF sponsored ' entertainer rather than an 'Army sponsored' entertainer, being sponsored by an organisation cannot be equated with being a representative of that organisation.\n CONCLUSION \n 17 The Tribunal's decision is not infected by error of law and the appeal must be dismissed with costs.\n I certify that the preceding seventeen (17) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Edmonds.\nDated: 28 July 2006\n Counsel for the Appellant: Mr M Vincent \n Solicitor for the Appellant: Legal Aid Commission of NSW \n Counsel for the Respondent: Ms R Henderson \n Solicitor for the Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor \n Date of Hearing: 24 July 2006 \n Date of Judgment: 28 July 2006 \n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \n URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2006/942.html"

        "description": "1 This is an application for judicial review whereby the applicant seeks to set aside the decision of the Migration Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') which upheld the decision of the delegate of the first respondent to cancel the applicant's visa under s 116 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) ('the Act').\nI join the Tribunal as the second respondent.\n2 At the commencement of the hearing the applicant sought to tender the affidavit of Mr Peter Dell of 3 October 2005.\nI declined the applicant's application on the grounds that the evidence was not before the Tribunal and, as the issue before the Court was whether the Tribunal had made a jurisdictional error on the evidence before it, the evidence was irrelevant.\n3 The judgment in this matter was delayed pending the outcome of the first respondent's appeal in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Zhou [2006] FCAFC 96 on the grounds that, if the first respondent failed in that appeal, the applicant may have had an additional ground of review.\nOn 16 June 2006 the Full Court allowed the first respondent's appeal.\n4 For the reasons which I set out below, the application should be dismissed.\n5 The applicant is a citizen of the Republic of Korea born on 15 October 1977.\nHe entered Australia on 5 October 1999.\nOn 2 August 2004 the applicant commenced a Bachelor of Commerce degree at Curtin University of Technology ('the University').\nOn 10 September 2004 the applicant was granted a Student (Temporary) (Class TU) Subclass 573 visa ('the visa') which had an expiry date of 15 March 2005.\nThe applicant's visa was subject to certain conditions including Condition 8202 in Sch 8 of the Migration Regulations 1994 (Cth) ('the Regulations').\n6 On 8 March 2005 the University sent the applicant a notice pursuant to s 20 of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 (Cth) ('the ESOS Act') advising the applicant that he had breached a condition of his student visa in relation to satisfactory academic performance in the course in which he was enrolled ('the s 20 Notice').\n 'Terminated from course: unsatisfactory academic performance due to failures (2x \"Did Not complete\", 1x \"Did Not Attend\" result for 3 units).\n7 The notice further advised:\n 'Pursuant to section 137J of the Migration Act 1958 , your student visa will cease on the 28 th day after the date of this notice, unless you report to DIMIA by that time.\nThe day count begins on the first day after the date of this notice and ends on the 28 th day thereafter.\n8 On 15 March 2005 the applicant attended an interview with a delegate of the first respondent ('the delegate') at an office of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ('the Department').\nThe applicant's visa was due to expire that day.\nAt the interview with the delegate, the applicant told the delegate that he needed to talk to the course coordinator about the appeal which the applicant had made against the decision of the University to terminate him from the course on the ground of unsatisfactory academic performance.\n 'Mr Kang said his wife is a dependant on his visa.\nHis wife is at home at the moment.\nHe said he has appealed against his results of Semester 2/2004.\nHe lodged this appeal approx 5 weeks ago.\nHe lodges his appeal with the examination board at Curtin.\n9 At 10.27 am on the morning of the interview, the delegate gave the applicant a 'Notice of Intention to Consider Cancellation' under s 119 of the Act ('the s 119 Notice').\nAt 11.01 am, after the applicant had been unable to contact his course coordinator at the University, the delegate issued the applicant a notice under s 116 of the Act cancelling his visa because of a breach of Condition 8202.\n10 Section 20 of the ESOS Act provides:\n ' Sending students notice of visa breaches \n (1) A registered provider must send an accepted student of the provider a written notice if the student has breached a student visa condition relating to attendance or satisfactory academic performance.\n ... \n (2) The registered provider must send the notice as soon as practicable after the breach.\n (3) The notice must be in a form approved by the Secretary of the Immigration Minister's Department.\n (4) The notice must: \n (a) contain particulars of the breach; and \n (b) state that the student is required to attend in person before an officer (within the meaning of the Migration Act 1958 ) at a specified place within 28 days after the day specified in the notice as the date of the notice, for the purpose of explaining the breach; and \n (c) state that the student must present photographic identification when so attending; and \n (d) set out the effect of sections 137J and 137K of that Act.\n Unincorporated registered providers.\n (5) If the registered provider is an unincorporated body, then it is instead the principal executive officer of the provider who must send the notice as required under this section.\n11 The general power to cancel visas is provided for in s 116 of the Act.\n 'If the Minister may cancel a visa under subsection (1), the Minister must do so if there exist prescribed circumstances in which a visa must be cancelled.\n12 Regulation 2.43(2) prescribes the following circumstances in which the Minister must cancel the visa:\n 'For

Tribunal \n14 On 23 March 2005 the applicant lodged an application with the Tribunal, for a review of the delegate's decision.\nIn response to the question 'Why do you think the DIMIA decision was incorrect?\n 'First, course termination does not mean that I cannot continue my study.\nHowever decision maker did not understand the circumstance at the time.\nFurthermore I talk with course coordinator.\nHe also agree that I can continue my study, because I have left only 3 more units in order to complete my degree.\nMy application is now under processing and once it prove, I can continue my study by next week.\n15 On 13 April 2005 Mr Peter Dell, the Undergraduate Course Leader from the School of Information Systems at the University, wrote the following:\n 'Kwan-Il Kang is

unable to enroll in Semester 1, 2005 because the deadline for enrolments had passed when his academic status was assessed.\nHe is required to enrol in Semester 2, 2005 to complete his degree.\n16 By email dated 9 May 2005, the Tribunal requested that the University provide the following information: the course that the applicant was enrolled in, the course semester dates between 10 September 2004 until 15 March 2005 and 'whether the University certifies that the applicant has achieved an academic result that is at least satisfactory for each term/semester between 10 September 2004 until 15 March 2005'.\n 'What course Mr Kang was enrolled in during 2004 and 2005 \n 130099 --- Bachelor of Commerce (Information Technology) \n What the term/semester dates are for 10 September 2004 until 15 March 2005 \n Semester 2 2004: 2 August---26 November 2004 \n Semester 1 2005: 28 February---24 June 2005 \n Whether the University certifies that Mr Kang has achieved an academic result that is at least satisfactory for each term/semester between 10 September 2004 until 15 March 2005.\n Semester 2 2004: 2 August---26 November 2004 \n Semester Weighted Average: (SWA) 9.50% unsatisfactory \n As a result of this performance Mr Kang was Terminated from the BComm (IT) degree in December, 2004.\n Kang appealed this status and was granted a reprieve of Conditional status, given after Sem 1 2005 had begun therefore is only eligible to re-enrol and study from semester 2, 2005.\n18 On 20 May 2005 the Tribunal sent the applicant a letter pursuant to s 359A of the Act, inviting him to comment on the following information:\n '...Curtin University of Technology have informed the Tribunal that they do not certify that your academic results for semester 2 of 2004 (2 August - 26 November) were at least satisfactory.\nIn fact they have stated that your results were unsatisfactory for this semester.\nThey have advised that your results were unsatisfactory for all of the above semesters.\n19 The letter further explained that the information was relevant for the review because it indicated that the applicant was in breach of Condition 8202, that requires the applicant to achieve an academic result that is certified by the education provider to be 'at least satisfactory' for each term/semester of the course.\n20 The applicant provided further information by way of a letter dated 27 May 2005.\nHe explained that during semester 2 of 2004 he was planning on leaving Australia because his wife had become pregnant.\nHe said that on further consideration he decided to complete his degree because he had three units left and the degree was important for his future.\nHe explained that in February 2005 he appealed against his academic status to the examination board and was waiting on that outcome when he received the s 20 Notice and attended an interview at the department.\nThe applicant further wrote that after the student visa was cancelled he received a letter from the University explaining that he was eligible to continue study and eligible to complete his degree.\n21 The applicant attended the Tribunal to give oral evidence on 27 June 2005.\n22 On 13 July 2005 the Tribunal affirmed the decision under review to cancel the applicant's visa for breach of Condition 8202.\n23 The Tribunal stated in its decision that it did not have the discretion whether or not to cancel a visa if Condition 8202 had not been complied with.\nThe visa must be cancelled if it is established that a breach of the condition has occurred, even if the breach was due to exceptional circumstances.\n '... that the [University] , the review applicant's education provider, had not certified his results to be at least satisfactory for Semester 2 of 2004.\nThe review applicant conceded that his results were not satisfactory for this semester in his evidence to the Tribunal and he explained the circumstances that led to his poor performance.\n25 The Tribunal also said at [30]:\n 'As the review applicant has only three units to complete to attain his degree the Department may give consideration to waiving the three year ban on his being granted another visa.\nParticular [ly] since he is no longer excluded from his course and has permission to enrol.\n The application for review before the Court \n26 An amended application was filed on 11 October 2005.\n (a) The Tribunal erred in cancelling the visa on the basis of an assessment by the University of the applicant's academic performance by reference to the full period of semester 2 of 2004, which ran from 2 August 2004 until 26 November 2004, when the applicant's visa period was for a lesser period.\nThe visa period commenced on 10 September 2004 - which was over five weeks after the commencement of semester 2.\n(b) The delegate failed to extend procedural fairness to the applicant.\nThe delegate issued a notice of intention to cancel the applicant's visa at 10.27 am on 15 March 2005, and then cancelled the visa at 11.03 am that day, without giving the applicant the time that he needed to talk to his course coordinator about his pending appeal.\nThis procedural flaw could not be remedied before the Tribunal.\n(c) The Tribunal ignored relevant evidence and asked itself the wrong question because it did not address the lack of procedural fairness before the delegate.\n(d) The Tribunal ignored relevant evidence, failed to take into account relevant evidence and/or asked itself the wrong question in the course of considering the response from the University on 17 May 2005, to the Tribunal's email request of 9 May 2005.\nThis was because, the Tribunal had concentrated only on that part of the University's response that referred to the 'semester weighted average' and had ignored that part of the University's response that had said that the applicant had appealed and had been given a 'Conditional status' and therefore was eligible to re-enrol and study from semester 2 of 2005.\nThe Tribunal misconceived the information from the University as amounting to a 'certification of unsatisfactory academic results, or the omission to certify that his academic results were at least satisfactory for semester 2 of 2004'.\n Reasoning \n Ground 1 --- Cancellation by reference to certification in respect of semester 2 of 2004 \n27 Counsel for the applicant submitted that the Tribunal did not address itself to the period covered by the visa.\nCounsel for the applicant submitted that the Tribunal erred in using the report of the University in respect of the applicant's 'semester weighted average' academic results as the basis on which to cancel the visa, because this referred to the full period of the semester and the applicant's visa was only issued after the commencement of the semester.\nCounsel submitted that the Regulations did not permit the cancellation of the visa in respect of an academic result which was assessed by reference to a term or semester that commenced prior to the issue of the visa which was cancelled.\n28 Counsel for the first respondent submitted that the Regulations do not require the visa holder to hold the visa throughout the semester.\nHe further submitted that there is nothing in the Regulations referring to a result for the 'full period' of the semester.\nThe reference in Condition 8202 to achieving an 'academic result' for a term or semester indicates that the condition is looking at the outcome at the end of the relevant term or semester.\n29 I accept the submissions of counsel for the first respondent.\nThe Regulations prescribe the means by which a visa holder is to satisfy the requirement of Condition 8202 in respect of academic performance.\nIt is by a visa holder obtaining a certificate from the education provider that the academic result is 'at least satisfactory' in respect of each term or semester as the case may be.\nThere is no qualification in the Regulations specifying the period of time that the visa holder was required to have held a specific visa prior to the end of the relevant term or semester.\nSatisfaction of the visa condition simply requires the production of a certificate in relation to the academic performance for the term or semester in question and contemplates that the certificate will be issued at the end of the term or semester.\nThe means of fulfilling the requirement is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the case of a person who is a student for the whole of the semester or term but whose visa expires during the term or semester and is issued a new visa during that term.\nThere is no dispute in this case that the applicant was enrolled at the commencement of the semester in question and was a student for the whole of the semester.\n30 The Tribunal did not err by having regard to the information from the University which referred to 'the semester weighted average' for semester 2 of 2004.\n31 Counsel for the applicant said that the applicant received the s 20 Notice on 14 March 2005, which stated that the applicant had 28 days from the date of the notice (8 March 2005) in which to respond.\nThe applicant was compelled to attend the departmental office on 15 March 2005 because the visa was due to expire that day.\nThe delegate who interviewed the applicant noted that the applicant's appeal against his termination from the course was still pending.\nAt the interview the applicant had tried to get into contact with a University officer who was in a meeting until 12 noon.\nHowever, the delegate proceeded to cancel the visa at 11.07 am on 15 March 2005 before contact with the University officer could be made.\n32 Counsel for the applicant submitted that it could be inferred from the delegate's actions referred to above, that the delegate wished to rush through the cancellation without giving the applicant an opportunity to speak with the University.\nThe delegate's refusal to grant the applicant a chance to respond to the alleged breach of Condition 8202 after he had spoken with the University, was a denial of procedural fairness.\nThe Tribunal erred in that it failed properly to consider the failure of the delegate to provide the applicant procedural fairness and failed to consider that the applicant's academic status was under internal review.\n33 Counsel for the first respondent argued that the Tribunal's function is to review the decision on the merits and within the framework provided in Div 5 of Pt 5 of the Act: Zubair v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 248 ; (2004) 139 FCR 344, followed in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Ahmed [2005] FCAFC 58 ; (2005) 143 FCR 314.\nThe Tribunal properly carried out its task of a merits review and asked itself the correct question on the merits review.\n34 I accept the submissions of counsel for the first respondent.\nThe Tribunal afforded the applicant a merits review and it was not, therefore, required to address any alleged denial of procedural fairness before the delegate ( Humayun v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2006] FCAFC 35 at [30] ('Humayun') ).\n35 Counsel for the applicant said that the Tribunal had received the response dated 17 May 2005 from the University referring to the applicant's 'semester weighted average' as being unsatisfactory for semester 2 of 2004, but that response had also stated that the applicant was no longer terminated and was granted a 'reprieve' of conditional status.\nCounsel submitted that the Tribunal treated the applicant's conditional status as of no significance and relied only on the reference in the response to the applicant's 'semester weighted average' as being conclusive that the University had not certified the applicant's academic result to be satisfactory.\n36 Counsel for the applicant submitted that the cases of Baidakova v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [1998] FCA 1436 and Weerasinghe v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCA 261 support the contention that an education provider can take into account discretionary factors when determining whether an applicant's academic result has been 'at least satisfactory'.\n37 Counsel for the applicant also submitted that the fact that the applicant's status was reassessed to be conditional, required the Tribunal to be satisfied that the University was not certifying the applicant's academic performance for semester 2 of 2004 as satisfactory.\nCounsel submitted that the s 20 Notice referred to particulars of the breach as being 'terminated'.\nThe applicant could reasonably suppose that the letter from the University on 13 April 2005 allowing the applicant to enrol was a refutation of the alleged breach.\nIt was incumbent on the Tribunal to resolve whether the letter could have been considered to be an implied certification or might give rise to a certification, of satisfactory academic results.\n38 Counsel for the applicant also argued that the Tribunal ought to have engaged in a 'qualitative enquiry' when considering whether the applicant had breached Condition 8202.\nInstead the Tribunal treated the 'semester weighted average' as conclusive evidence and ignored the significance of the University's internal review of the applicant's status, which took into account personal factors.\n39 Counsel for the first respondent submitted that the applicant's claim that the Tribunal misconceived material from the University was not made out.\nThe response by the University to the question asked by the Tribunal in its email of 9 May 2005, could be properly characterised as a statement that the applicant's results for semester 2 of 2004 were unsatisfactory.\nCounsel argued that there was no jurisdictional error in the Tribunal finding, on the basis of the response from the University, that the University had not certified his academic result as 'at least satisfactory'.\n40 Counsel for the first respondent submitted that the letter from the University dated 13 April 2005 deals with the applicant's status.\nIt did not go to the applicant's academic result for the semester.\nCounsel submitted that the applicant's ability to re-enrol said nothing about his academic result.\nCounsel for the first respondent submitted further that the Tribunal properly regarded the material as not going to the certification of the applicant's academic result.\n41 In Humayun at [21] Wilcox J (with whom Conti and Stone JJ agreed) confirmed that the education provider has a 'measure of discretion' as to what level of academic performance is satisfactory for the purposes of providing a certificate in respect of Condition 8202.\nHowever, Wilcox J (with whom Conti J agreed) drew a distinction between a decision made by the education provider in relation to whether an academic result was at least satisfactory and a decision made in relation to the status of a student.\n 'I see no inconsistency in an educational institution saying to a student, whether simultaneously or at different times: \n (i) \"we will allow you to continue your course\"; \n (ii) \"your academic results to date are unsatisfactory\".\n On 22 January 2003, the University made the first statement to the appellant; on 7 February 2003 it made the second.\n42 In that case, the majority found that the University's letter of 22 January 2003, did not constitute a certification by the provider which met the requirements of Condition 8202.\n43 The case which the applicant put to the Tribunal was that he accepted that his academic result was unsatisfactory, but that after having given the matter some consideration he had decided to appeal against his terminated status on the grounds that he had only three subjects left to do for his degree.\nIt is apparent that the Tribunal was conscious of the requirement to consider only the question of whether the education provider had certified that the applicant had achieved an academic result that was at least satisfactory, as opposed to any decision of the University in relation to the academic status of the applicant.\nIt cannot be said that, in so doing, the Tribunal asked itself the wrong question.\nThe Tribunal had considerable sympathy for the plight of the applicant but came to the view that the letter from the University of 13 April 2005 and the email response of 17 May 2005 from the University did not comprise a certificate to the effect that the academic result was 'at least satisfactory'.\nIt cannot be said that in coming to that view, the Tribunal misconceived the material from the University.\nThe letter of 13 April 2005 refers only to the student's academic status.\nThe email response from the University of 17 May 2005 itself draws a distinction between the applicant's academic result and his academic status.\nThe email does not certify that the applicant's appeal has led to the 'academic result' being reclassified as 'at least satisfactory'.\nThe email records that the 'semester weighted average' result was 'unsatisfactory', and says that the appeal resulted in a 'reprieve' in the academic status to 'conditional'.\n44 I also reject the contention of the applicant that the Tribunal committed jurisdictional error by failing to make inquiries as to whether or not the University's letter and email response meant that the University was thereby certifying that the academic result was 'at least satisfactory'.\nThere is no absolute obligation on the Tribunal to make inquiry ( Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Yu [2004] FCAFC 333 ; (2004) 141 FCR 448).\nOnce it is recognised that a distinction is to be drawn between a student achieving an academic result that is certified to be 'at least satisfactory', and the academic status accorded to a student, there was no ambiguity in relation to the material from the University and, therefore, no reason for the Tribunal to embark upon any inquiry of the University.\n45 I find, therefore, that the Tribunal did not fall into jurisdictional error.\nIt follows that the application must be dismissed with costs.\nI certify that the preceding forty-five (45) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Siopis.\nDated: 23 June 2006\n Counsel for the Applicant: Mr R Lindsay \n Solicitor for the Applicant: CGN Legal \n Counsel for the First Respondent: Mr J Allanson \n Solicitor for the First Respondent: Australian Government Solicitor \n Date of Hearing: 19 October 2005 and 15 February

        "description": "1 Dr Warren Saint, the applicant, has practised as a general practitioner in Western Australia for more than 20 years.\n2 Medicare Australia, of whom the fifth respondent is its chief executive officer, is the successor to the Health Insurance Commission (the Commission).\nIn 2000 the Commission administered the Medicare Benefits Scheme.\nLike other medical practitioners, Dr Saint, in the course of his practice, claimed monies under Medicare Benefits Scheme in respect of services he provided to his patients.\nThe Commission kept statistics of the claims made to Medicare made by medical practitioners in respect of the services provided by them and the nature of those services.\nIn 2000, by reason of the high number of daily services provided by Dr Saint, the Commission became concerned that Dr Saint may have engaged in \"inappropriate practice\" as defined by the Health Insurance Act 1973 (Cth) (the Act), by failing to provide his patients with an adequate clinical input.\n3 The Commission's concern about Dr Saint ultimately led to an enquiry being conducted under the Act by a committee comprised of the second, third and fourth respondents - all medical practitioners, with the third and fourth respondents being general practitioners.\nThe committee was known as the Professional Services Review Committee 204 (the Committee).\n4 In its final report issued on 7 July 2004, the Committee found that Dr Saint had, in the manner in which he had rendered some services to his patients, namely, services described as Medicare Benefit Schedule item 36 services, engaged in conduct which in the Committee's opinion was inappropriate practice.\nThe Act states that a general practitioner engages in \"inappropriate practice\" as a general practitioner in relation to the rendering of services, if the conduct is such that a Committee could reasonably conclude that the conduct would be unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners.\n5 Medicare Benefit Schedule item 36 services comprise the professional attendance of a general practitioner on a patient which involves taking a detailed history, an examination of multiple systems, arranging any necessary investigations and implementing a management plan in relation to one or more problems and lasting at least 20 minutes.\n6 In summary, the Committee's finding was that Dr Saint had in rendering some of these MBS item 36 services engaged in inappropriate practice because he had failed to provide \"adequate clinical input into the services\" and/or he had \"kept records that were deficient in essential clinical information\".\n7 The making of this final report by the Committee was the culmination of a statutory process which involved a number of prescribed stages.\nFirst, there was a referral of Dr Saint's conduct by a delegate of the Commission, Dr Mould, to the first respondent (the Director), called an investigative referral.\nThen there was the establishment of the Committee by the Director and a referral of Dr Saint's conduct, called an adjudicative referral, from the Director to the Committee.\nThereafter, there was a hearing by the Committee and the issue of a draft report of its findings by the Committee.\nFinally, the Committee issued its final report.\n8 By this proceeding, Dr Saint challenged the constitutional validity of statutory process referred to above.\nFurther, Dr Saint also sought judicial review of the decisions made by the decision-makers at each of the steps in the statutory process referred to above; and the processes leading to the making of the decisions.\nDr Saint sought the remedies under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977 (Cth) (the ADJR Act) and s 39B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) .\n Background \n9 In June 1995, the Commission published a newsletter explaining the operation of the statutory professional services review scheme affecting medical practitioners.\nThe newsletter was entitled \"Inappropriate Practice and Counselling\".\nThe newsletter outlined a process which provided for a medical practitioner to be counselled in respect of his or her pattern of servicing and to be given an opportunity to change that pattern, before the Commission would take further action in respect of that pattern of servicing under the Act.\nDr Saint said in evidence that he became aware of this newsletter in 1996.\n10 On 14 February 1996, an officer of the Commission, Dr Patrick Hertnon, interviewed Dr Saint in relation to his practice statistics for the period 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1995.\nDr Hertnon informed Dr Saint that based on his statistics the Commission had concerns that the high volume of patients seen by Dr Saint may indicate that he had engaged in inappropriate practice.\nPrior to that meeting, Dr Hertnon had written to Dr Saint providing him with his provider statistics.\n11 On 29 October 1996, Dr Peter Laundy, another officer of the Commission, interviewed Dr Saint about the high level of services revealed by his practice statistics.\nDr Laundy expressed to Dr Saint the high degree of concern which the Commission held that by reason of his high level of services, Dr Saint may be engaging in inappropriate practice.\nDr Laundy told Dr Saint that the failure by him to alleviate the concerns of the Commission may result in a referral being made to the Director.\nDr Saint told Dr Laundy that one of the problems was that one of the doctors in the practice who had formerly worked full-time was now working part-time.\nHe said that he expected that the doctor would return to work full-time and that he was also expecting to engage a woman doctor to work part-time.\n12 On 4 June 1997, the Acting Manager Professional Review Branch Western Australia sent Dr Saint a letter noting a change in his practice statistics and advising him that no further action would be taken at that time.\n13 On 18 January 2000, Dr Saint was again interviewed by Dr Laundy.\nDr Laundy prepared a report of the meeting.\nBy a letter dated 25 January 2000, Dr Laundy forwarded a copy of that report to Dr Saint and invited comment on the report within 14 days.\nThe report stated that Dr Laundy had advised Dr Saint of the Commission's concerns regarding his high level of services and that this many may lead to the making by the Commission of an investigative referral.\nIt also said that Dr Saint had explained that the practice was very busy, he had difficulty in employing other doctors to work in the practice, there was a shortage of doctors in the area and that he liked working long hours.\nThe meeting is referred to further below.\n14 By letter dated 5 February 2000, Dr Saint responded to Dr Laundy's letter.\nDr Saint stated that the record of interview failed to mention the fact that the surgery was open on Sundays and public holidays.\nDr Saint also mentioned that one of the doctors at the practice, Dr Rae, who had been working \"very part-time\" would from February 2000 be working two days a week and that he expected that that would take some workload off himself.\nHe also asked for the Commission to supply him with further statistics to ensure that Dr Rae worked \"at a time when the practice had its greater workload.\n\" Further statistics were subsequently provided to Dr Saint.\n15 Dr Saint received a letter dated 23 March 2000 from Mr Neville Garrity, Manager of the Professional Services Review Branch WA, of the Commission.\n Further to your discussion with Dr Peter Laundy of 18 January 2000 regarding your high number of total annual services rendered and also high daily servicing.\nThe Health Insurance Commission (HIC) notes with some concern that Dr Laundy and Dr Hertnon had already spoken to you of these issues several years ago and that a temporary decrease in servicing was followed by a gradual increase.\nThe HIC will review your Provider Summary Statistics in approximately three months time looking for changes to your servicing levels, I will communicate further with you at that time.\nIf significant changes do not occur, the papers may be forwarded to the Director, Professional Services Review Scheme.\n As advised to you in my letter of 23 March 2000, the proposed review of your Provider Summary Statistics has occurred.\nThe Health Insurance Commission's concerns of possible inappropriate practice still remain.\nYour case is being referred to the Medical Director, Professional Review Division for further opinion.\nA referral of the case to the Director, Professional Services Review may follow.\nFurther correspondence will be sent to you advising whether or not your case is proceeding to the Director, Professional Services Review.\n The CMC meeting No.\n194 of 7 June 2000 noted that Dr Warren Saint has been repeatedly counselled by Health Insurance Commission Medical Advisers particularly regarding high daily and high annual servicing of his patients.\nThe CMC was of the view that Dr Warrant Saint's practice may still be considered as possibly inappropriate and is referring the matter to you with a view to onforwarding to the Director, Professional Services Review.\n18 Dr Saint received a letter dated 19 July 2000 from Dr Janet Mould, Manager Professional Services Branch of the Commission.\n I refer to correspondence forwarded to you on 3 July 2000 by Mr Neville Garrity, Manager Professional Review Branch, WA, in which you were advised that your practice profile has been forwarded to me for my consideration of whether to refer your conduct in relation to inappropriate practice to the Director of Professional Services Review.\nI have allowed a suitable period of time for your statistics to reflect any changes in your practice profile.\nA review of your practice statistics reveals that the HIC concerns remain.\nSubsequently, I wish to advise that I have decided to refer your practice to the Director of Professional Services Review for his consideration on whether you have engaged in inappropriate practice under the Professional Services Review Scheme.\n19 On 21 August 2000, Dr Mould as a delegate of the Commission made an investigative referral to the Director, pursuant to s 86 of the Act, of Dr Saint's conduct in connection with rendering and initiation of services.\n20 The referred services were described in the investigative referral as services rendered during the period 1 January to 31 December 1999 from his practice location in Bassendean.\n21 The investigative referral together with its annexures was a lengthy document.\nIt comprised two books and exceeded 220 pages and included a print out of a number of computer records recording the services rendered by Dr Saint.\nThe referral also recorded the delegate's reasons for the referral.\n A REASONS FOR THE INVESTIGATIVE REFERRAL The Health Insurance Commission is concerned with certain aspects of Dr Saint's practice, namely, his rendered services and daily servicing.\n&#8226; a review of Dr Saint's practice statistics;\n&#8226; a comparison of those statistics with the data concerning the practice of all active general practitioners in Australia;\n&#8226; reports from the counselling interviews by Health Insurance Commission Medical Advisers where the above concerns were discussed;\n&#8226; a review of Dr Saint's practice statistics since counselling; and\n&#8226; other information.\nDr Saint's practice statistics for the counselling period (1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999) were reviewed.\nA Medical Adviser from the Health Insurance Commission met with Dr Saint on the 18 January 2000 for the purposes of counselling under the Professional Services Review Scheme.\nDr Saint had been previously counselled by the Health Insurance Commission on 14 February 1996 and again on 29 October 1996 in relation to his rendered services.\nAt the meting [sic] on 18 January 2000, the Medical Adviser outlined the Health Insurance Commission's concerns and sought an explanation from Dr Saint as to why his practice appears to be different from that of other general practitioners.\n(A history of the contacts with Dr Saint since February 1996 is included in the Chronological Record of this Referral at E).\nAfter counselling, the Health Insurance Commission reviewed Dr Saint's practice statistics and other available information.\nThe Health Insurance Commission determined there had been insufficient change to remove the overall concerns expressed above.\nThe Health Insurance Commission is concerned that, at this level of servicing, Dr Saint may not have provided appropriate professional services to his patients.\nFurther, or in the alternative, the Health Insurance Commission is concerned that Dr Saint may not have satisfied the requirements of the relevant items in the Medicare Benefits Schedule.\nConsequently, the Health Insurance Commission is of the view that Dr Saint may be practising inappropriately and that the matter should be referred for consideration by the Director of Professional Services Review.\n22 The records of the interviews which Dr Hertnon had conducted with Dr Saint on 14 February 1996, and which Dr Laundy had conducted with Dr Saint on 29 October 1996 and 18 January 2000 were included in the materials comprising the investigative referral.\nFurther, Dr Saint's letter of 5 February 2000 responding to Dr Laundy's record of interview of 18 January 2000, as well as subsequent correspondence arising therefrom, was also included in the documents comprising the investigative referral.\n23 The investigative referral also identified under the heading \"Specific Areas of Concern for the Investigative Referral\" the practice area of \"Rendered Services and Daily Servicing\".\n The referral period --- 1 January 1999 to 31 December 1999 During the referral period Dr Saint: &#8226; rendered 18,675 services to 4,110 patients at a total benefit of $460,922.95; &#8226; had an average of 4.54 services per patient; and &#8226; rendered 60 or more services per day on 176 occasions and 80 or more services per day on 44 occasions.\nDr Saint's total services rendered are substantially above the 99th percentile (15,383) when compared with all active general practitioners in Australia.\n24 The investigative referral also included as Table 5 a table of Dr Saint's servicing statistics for each quarter during the period 1 January 1996 to 31 March 2000.\n25 Notice of the making of the investigative referral was given by the Commission to Dr Saint under s 88(2) of the Act.\nDr Saint was invited to make written submissions to the Director within 14 days stating why the Director should dismiss the investigative referral without setting up a committee.\nDr Saint was provided with a copy of the investigative referral.\n26 On 12 September 2000, Dr Saint made a 14 page submission to the Director in response to the invitation issued to him under s 88(2) of the Act.\n(The document, which is Exhibit \"A\" in the proceeding, however, bears the mistaken date of 12 August 2000.\n Further looking at Table 5.\nI was \"counselled\" once on the 18th Jan 2000 and my figures have not increased since then.\nFor the last two quarters of 1999 the total rendered services is 4,930 and 4,993 respectively.\nFor the first quarter of 2000 the total rendered services was 4,563 which is in fact a reduction of 9% not an increase.\nDuring the \"counselling\" on the 18th Jan 2000 I asked if the HIC would like me to cut back my servicing.\nDr Laundy replied that \"The HIC was not asking him to cut back his services.\n\" In relation to \"counselling\" I note that in an extract from CMC meeting No 194 of 7 June 2000 it states \"SMA reports that he counselled Dr Saint under the provisions of the PSRS on the 18/1/2000\" and then states \"Dr Saint was previously counselled on 29/10/1996\".\nThe extract then goes on to state \"In view of the multiple counsellings\" when in fact there are only two, 29/10/1996 and 18/1/2000.\nFurther, in the letter that Neville Garrity wrote to Dr Janet Mould dated the 3 July 2000 he states \"The CMC meeting No 194 of 7 June 2000 noted that Dr Warren Saint has been repeatedly counselled by the Health Insurance Commission Medical Advisors...\".\nThis is not an accurate account of the CMC meeting No 194 of 7 June 2000 as reported.\n27 Dr Saint also commented on each of the \"Top 40\" patients which were listed in a report known as the PIRT report, which also was included among the documents comprising the investigative referral.\nDr Saint went on to explain in summary that he worked an average of 64.5 hours per week, enjoyed working long hours and that there was a high demand for medical services in the area.\n [A]ll Medicare Benefits Schedule item 35 and 36 services rendered from the practice location at 39 Old Perth Road, Bassendean, Western Australia 6054 during the period on and from 1 January 1999 to and including 31 December 1999.\n29 The Director also recorded that pursuant to s 89(1), he had conducted an investigation into the referred services but that he had not dismissed the referral under s 91 of the Act.\n30 The Director's report was an attachment to the adjudicative referral.\n Accordingly I decided to make an adjudicative referral to a Committee in accordance with section 93 for the Committee to consider whether Dr Saint's conduct in connection with the rendering of MBS item 35 and 36 services may have constituted engaging in inappropriate practise by failing to provide appropriate professional services to his patients and/or failing to satisfy the requirements of the relevant items in the MBS and in particular by: &#8226; failing to provide adequate clinical input into the services; &#8226; rendering services that were not medically necessary; &#8226; prescribing drugs in the absence of accepted medical indications; and &#8226; keeping records that were deficient in essential clinical information.\n31 By an instrument dated 18 May 2001, Dr Holmes also established the Committee.\n32 By a letter dated 13 September 2001, the Committee advised Dr Saint that it would hold a hearing on 1 November and 2 November 2001 at which Dr Saint would be required to give evidence.\n [F]indings of inappropriate practice based on sampling, if any, to be applied to the total number of services rendered during the Referral Period for the particular item number under consideration.\n The Committee will commence to consider at least 30 of the services specified in the attachment...These have been drawn from a preliminary random sample of your item 35 and 36 services provided by the Health Insurance Commission.\nAfter this part of the sampling process, (the exploratory sampling stage) has been completed, the Committee will calculate the initial percentage of inappropriate practice (if any).\nHaving determined the percentage of inappropriate practice in the exploratory sample, the Committee would then calculate how many additional services it needed to consider to reach a statistically valid finding of overall inappropriate practice.\nYou would then be required to provide the Committee with whatever additional patient records were needed to complete this second stage of the sampling process.\n34 On 1 November and 2 November 2001, the hearing was conducted.\nDr Saint gave evidence and was questioned by the Committee.\nHe was represented at this hearing by a legal practitioner.\n35 On 26 November 2001, the second respondent, Dr Ruse, who was the Chairman of the Committee, wrote to Dr Saint's solicitor stating that in light of the decision in Pradhan v Holmes [2001] FCA 1560 ; (2001) 125 FCR 280 ( Pradhan ) the Committee's hearing into the conduct of Dr Saint would be suspended until \"the legal position is clear\".\nThe Pradhan case had held that an investigative referral was invalid, because it had been made in terms which, relevantly, were the same as the referral made in respect of Dr Saint's conduct.\n36 On 24 January 2003, the Director wrote to Dr Saint saying that recent amendments to the Act had validated Referral Number 204 together with a number of other referrals.\nThe letter also stated that the Secretary for the Committee would contact him in due course to notify him of the resumption of the Committee's proceedings.\n37 By a letter dated 7 February 2003, the Director advised Dr Saint that the Committee did not intend to examine any MBS item 35 services.\n38 Further, in that letter the Director said that the Committee had to date employed sampling methodology in accordance with the Health Insurance (Professional Services Review --- Sampling Methodology) Determination 2000 (No 1).\nHe said that if the Committee was to employ the sampling methodology in the determination it would require the Committee to examine a further 47 MBS item 36 services to obtain the final random sample.\nThis was likely to require at least two further hearing days and additional medical records would need to be produced.\n However, under section 106K(4) of the Act, the Committee is permitted to use a different sampling methodology, provided it is certified as statistically valid by a statistician accredited by the Statistical Society of Australia.\nHaving regard to the time and cost implications for all concerned of continuing with the standard methodology outlined above, the Committee is considering an alternative whereby no further services would be examined but instead the confidence interval is recalculated for the existing results.\n The Committee accordingly intends to ask Professor Nicholls whether in this case it would be statistically valid to base its findings on the 38 MBS Item 36 services already examined, without examining further services.\nHowever, before writing to Professor Nicholls, the Committee would like to know whether you have any comments on the proposal that the Committee concludes its sampling at this point and makes its findings on the 38 MBS Item 36 services already examined.\nThis means there would be no need to produce additional records and possibly attend two further sittings for the Committee to examine an additional 47 services.\nThe Committee would instead commence its draft report.\nI remind you also, that you will be given a separate opportunity to make further general submissions to the Committee in writing before it starts its draft report.\nYou will also be given a copy of the draft report and you will have the opportunity to make further written submissions suggesting changes to it.\n40 Dr Saint did not respond to the invitation to comment which was contained in the letter.\n41 By an email dated 21 March 2003, the Secretary of the Committee wrote to Professor Nicholls in asking for his opinion as had been foreshadowed in the letter to Dr Saint referred to in [39] above.\n Re: Professional Services Review Committee 204 I have reviewed the approach outlined in your e-mail attachment dated 21 March 2003 and note the following: \n &#8226; The Committee has employed the statistical sampling methodology authorised under section 106K of the Health Insurance Act 1973 and described in the Health Insurance (Professional Services Review-Sampling Methodology) Determination 2000 (No 1).\n&#8226; From the class size of 932 services a random sample of 38 services have been examined and the Committee considers 14 of these unacceptable which is 36% (rounded down) of the sample.\n&#8226; If no further services are examined, applying appropriate statistical techniques it can be shown that we can be 95% confident that the true percentage of inappropriate practice lies between 36% +/- 16%, that is the lower 95% confident limit is 20%.\nThis value (20%) is to be chosen as the level of inappropriate practice (rather than 36%), not 21% as you have indicated (the difference being as a result of appropriate rounding to benefit the person under review).\n&#8226; In accordance with the methodology in the Determination, a further 47 services would need to be examined.\nHad a further 47 randomly selected services been examined, the percentage of inappropriate practice based on the sample of 85 would have been expected to be 36% (rounded down) so that the final percentage of inappropriate practice would have been 26% (36%-10%).\nBy choosing the smaller sample of 38 rather than 85, half the width of the 95% confidence interval has increased from 10% to 16%.\nSince the lower confident limit is chosen as the percentage of inappropriate practice the person being reviewed will benefit from the approach based on the smaller sample.\nIn conclusion, \n &#8226; it is statistically valid to accept the conclusion based on the sample of 38 services that the level of inappropriate practice will be determined as 20%, and\n &#8226; stopping the sampling process after considering 38 services will not (statistically) disadvantage the person under review.\nI confirm that I am a statistician accredited by the Statistical Society of Australia Inc, as required under subsection 106K(4) of the Act.\nIf you have any further queries relating to this matter please don't hesitate to contact me.\n43 The Committee did not conduct any further hearings and proceeded to prepare a draft report on the basis of the sample it had examined.\n44 Under cover of a letter dated 14 October 2003, Ms Kaylene Horler, the Secretary of the Committee, forwarded to Dr Saint a copy of the draft report of the Committee.\nThe draft report stated that the Committee proposed to find that, in rendering services to 14 identified patients, Dr Saint had engaged in inappropriate practice.\nThe letter invited Dr Saint to provide, within 21 days, written submissions suggesting changes to be made to the draft report.\nDr Saint responded to the invitation by making detailed submissions in respect of the draft report.\n45 On 7 June 2004, the Committee made its final report.\nA copy of this report was forwarded to Dr Saint under cover of a letter dated 8 June 2004 from Ms Horler.\nAs previously mentioned, it found that Dr Saint had engaged in inappropriate practice.\n46 Dr Saint's first broad ground of challenge was that ss 10, 20, 20A and Pt VAA of the Act, alternatively ss 82, 86, 93 and ss 106B, 106G, 106H, 106K, 106KA, 106L and 106U of the Act, are invalid.\nFurther or alternatively, it was claimed that s 106U of the Act purported to confer the judicial power of the Commonwealth on persons who had not been appointed under s 72 of the Constitution and was invalid.\n47 There was no argument advanced at the hearing in support of this ground of challenge.\nDr Saint said that there were two cases which were then pending on appeal before the Full Court which had raised the same grounds of challenge as relied on by Dr Saint.\nThese cases were Selim v Lele [2006] FCA 126 ; (2006) 150 FCR 83 and Dimian and Wong v The Commonwealth of Australia , an application which was remitted to the Federal Court by the High Court.\n48 The parties reserved their respective positions until the outcome in these two cases.\nAccordingly, the only evidence advanced and contentions made at the trial by each party related to the second ground of challenge relied on by Dr Saint, namely, judicial review.\nAt the end of the argument on the judicial review ground of challenge, I adjourned the hearing to a date to be fixed so as to accommodate the position that the parties may wish to make submissions in relation to the constitutional challenge after the Full Court had handed down its decision.\n49 The Full Court delivered its decision in Selim v Lele [2008] FCAFC 13 on 27 February 2008 dismissing the constitutional challenges.\nBoth parties advised my Associate that they did not wish to make any further submissions in relation to that ground of challenge.\nFollowing receipt of this information, I then formally reserved my decision on 28 March 2008.\n50 Following the decision of the Full Court, I dismiss the claims for the declarations sought by Dr Saint based on the constitutional challenge pleaded at [ 70] to [98 ] of the further re-amended statement of claim.\n51 Dr Saint read a number of affidavits.\nHis main affidavit was sworn on 21 April 2006 and his second affidavit was sworn on 26 May 2006.\nDr Saint also relied upon two affidavits of Dr John Henstridge sworn on 23 June 2006 and 5 December 2006 respectively.\nIn addition, Dr Saint gave short oral evidence.\nHe was not cross-examined.\n52 The first affidavit of Dr Saint comprised 509 paragraphs and 174 pages.\nThere were 166 annexures.\nThere were two annexures to Dr Saint's second affidavit.\nAmong the annexures to the affidavits was correspondence between Dr Saint and officers of the Committee responsible for processing applications made under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (the FOI Act).\nDr Saint made a number of requests under the FOI Act and the correspondence annexed to his affidavit included schedules of documents compiled by officers of the Committee in response to his FOI requests disclosing a list of the communications which had occurred between the Secretary and other officers of the Committee and the second third and fourth respondents before and after the hearing in November 2001.\nDr Saint relied upon one of these schedules [annexure WJS 157] in his written submissions in reply, in support of his contention that the Committee acted unlawfully by not meeting to consider its final report and other procedural steps leading up to the making of the final report.\n[See [135]-[140] below].\nIn addition to the schedules, the annexures to the affidavits also included copies of letters between the Secretary of the Committee and the members of the Committee and drafts of the draft report and the final report of the Committee.\nThus, Dr Saint's second affidavit annexed a copy of a draft of the draft report of the Committee and a covering letter from Ms Horler dated 1 September 2003 addressed to each of the third respondent and the fourth respondent.\nThere was also annexed to that affidavit a copy of a draft of the final report of the Committee.\nThere were also documents which Dr Saint had prepared which contained information obtained from his FOI requests, disclosing the process whereby the Committee had reached its decision.\nAnnexure WJS154 to Dr Saint's first affidavit is an example of this kind of document.\n53 Counsel for the respondents objected to the admissibility of a large number of the paragraphs in the affidavits of Dr Saint on the grounds of going mainly to relevance, comment and the argumentative nature of the material.\nFurther, counsel objected to the tender of any evidence which exposed or purported to expose the decision making process of the Committee, for the purpose of impugning the decision of the Committee.\nThis objection was based on the principle of judicial immunity.\nThe parties accepted that the hearing should proceed and that I would rule on the challenges to the admissibility of the evidence in my reasons.\n54 I deal first with the objections to Dr Saint's evidence on the grounds of other than judicial immunity.\nAs a general rule, new evidence is not permissible on the hearing of an application for judicial review.\nThe evidence which will be admissible is that which is necessary in order to make good a contention that raises a relevant question of law.\nMuch of the affidavit of Dr Saint did not observe these rules of evidence, addressing many issues going to the merits of the decision or containing comment, contentions and arguments.\nSenior counsel for Dr Saint accepted that paragraphs 89 to 381 and 389 to 480 of Dr Saint's affidavit were inadmissible on this ground.\nHowever, it was accepted that the documents referred to as annexures in those paragraphs could be tendered only in so far as they comprised documents that were before the Committee or contained extracts of the transcript of the Committee's hearing.\nThe remainder of my rulings are set out in the schedule to these reasons.\nIn my ruling in the schedule, I refer to some objections as having been \"conceded\".\nI have included under that category any response by the applicant to an objection, in the terms that the document is \"read as a submission only\".\nI reject the application to read those documents as a submission.\n55 Counsel for the respondents also submitted that evidence such as the communications between Ms Horler, the Secretary of the Committee, and the members of the Committee about drafting the reports, drafts of the reports and documents prepared by Dr Saint derived from these documents, was inadmissible because it was advanced to show the means whereby the Committee made its decision, with a view to impugning of the lawfulness of the decision of the Committee.\nThe respondents contended that each of the members of the Committee enjoys judicial immunity by reason of s 106F(1) of the Act.\nThis section provides that each member of the Committee has, in the performance of his or her duties, the same protection and immunity as a Justice of the High Court.\nIt follows, said the respondents, that it is not open to the applicant to seek to advance evidence of the means whereby the Committee members came to their decision, because the immunity is an absolute immunity and if the Committee members had to answer allegations about how they came to their decision, they would lose the immunity.\nDr Saint argued that the judicial immunity would only preclude from admission into evidence documents or other evidence which exposes the actual thought processes of the Committee.\n56 In the case of Herijanto v Refugee Review Tribunal [2000] HCA 49 ; (2000) 170 ALR 379 , Gaudron J held that the entire general protection and immunity of a Justice of the High Court is conferred on a member of the Refugee Review Tribunal by s 435(1) of the Migration Act 1959 (Cth).\n ...immunity from disclosing any aspect of the decision-making process.\n57 In Herijanto v Refugee Review Tribunal (No 2) [2000] HCA 21 ; (2000) 170 ALR 575 ( Herijanto (No 2) ), the plaintiffs in that case were seeking to undermine a statement made by the Tribunal in its reasons for rejecting a visa application, that it had considered certain specified documents stored in a computer database before making a decision.\n So far as the plaintiffs seek discovery to ascertain whether the individual members concerned with their review applications gained access to the Pt B documents stored in computer databases, they seek to achieve indirectly what they cannot achieve directly by means of interrogatories.\nThe protection afforded to individual members of the tribunal by s 435(1) of the Act would be illusory if, although they could not be compelled to disclose their decision-making processes, those processes could be revealed by analysis of computer records.\nIn my view, the protection and privilege conferred by s 435(1) of the Act extends not merely to disclosure by the individual member concerned, but the revelation, by whatever means, of any aspect of his or her decision-making process.\nThis seems to have been the basis for the decision in Zanatta v McCleary.\nIn that case the evidence of counsel was not admissible to prove an out of court statement by a judge as to his decision-making process.\nAnd it may also be the rationale for the decision of the Privy Council in Ramlochan v R in which it was held that a defendant in criminal proceedings was not entitled to production of the notes of the judge who presided at a his previous trial.\n(Emphasis added.\nFootnotes omitted.\n58 In my view, evidence which exposes or purports to expose the means whereby the Committee came to its decision, is inadmissible for the purpose of impugning the decision of the Committee.\nThis is because if evidence was admitted for that purpose the absolute immunity of the Committee from having to answer as to how they came to their decision, would be lost.\nI do not accept that the preclusion is limited to the class of evidence contended for by Dr Saint.\nSuch a limitation is inconsistent with the width of the preclusion described by Gaudron J as \"any aspect\" of the decision-making process.\nFurther, it is significant that in Herijanto (No 2) the plaintiffs were not seeking access to documents and information disclosing the thought processes of the Tribunal, but discovery of the documents which the Tribunal had accessed before making its decision.\nGaudron J refused discovery on the basis that the preclusion extended to \"any aspect\" of the decision making process.\n59 It follows that I do not accept into evidence any of the documents including the documents compiled by Dr Saint from the derived information or any other evidence, on which Dr Saint sought to rely to expose the process whereby the Committee made its decision, for the purpose of impugning the Committee's decision on the grounds referred to in [129]to [140] below.\n60 As will be apparent from these reasons, the expert evidence of Dr Henstridge, Professor Nicholls and Mr Clark did not loom large in the resolution of the contentions made before the court.\nHowever, notwithstanding this fact, and that the evidence did contain matters which did not go to the issues in contention between the parties, I will, nevertheless, admit the evidence in the affidavits of Dr Henstridge, Professor Nicholls and Mr Clark, reserving the question of the weight to be placed on that evidence.\n Procedural unfairness \n61 Dr Saint's first contention in relation to the making of investigative referral is that he was denied procedural fairness.\n62 Dr Saint contended that the Commission had represented that, before making an investigative referral, a medical practitioner would be counselled and given an opportunity to make adjustments to his practice to accommodate the concerns of the Commission.\nDr Saint contended that this did not occur in his case and there was procedural unfairness because he was not given the opportunity to make submissions as to why the Commission should give effect to its representation and this failure by the Commission resulted in practical unfairness.\n63 In support of this claim, Dr Saint referred to the following matters.\n64 First, Dr Saint said that in the newsletter referred to in [9] above the Commission represented that, before making an investigative referral, it would, by counselling, warn a medical practitioner about its concerns, advise him or her of the risk of not adjusting his or her practice to accommodate those concerns, and give him or her an opportunity to make appropriate adjustments.\nDr Saint also sought to characterise the statement in the newsletter as the publication by the Commission of a procedure, and he founded an alternative challenge on the basis that the Commission had not followed a published procedure.\n65 Secondly , Dr Saint said that at the interview with Dr Laundy on 18 January 2000, Dr Laundy told him that the Commission was not asking him to cut back his services.\n66 Thirdly, Dr Saint said that the letter from Mr Garrity dated 23 March 2000 set out at [15] above was a representation that the Commission would make a decision whether to make a investigative referral after reviewing his practice statistics for the second quarter of 2000.\n67 Dr Saint contended that the Commission did not give effect to its representation, because he was not given an opportunity to make changes to his practice to accommodate the concerns of the Commission, before the investigative referral was made.\nThis was because, said Dr Saint, the Commission had regard to his statistics for the first quarter of 2000 in assessing whether to make an investigative referral, notwithstanding that at the interview in January 2000 Dr Laundy had said that the Commission was not asking him to cut back his services, and Mr Garrity had said in his letter of 23 March 2000 that the Commission would review his statistics for the second quarter of 2000 for the purposes of determining whether to make an investigative referral.\n68 In my view, Dr Saint was counselled and given an opportunity to make improvements to his practice before the Commission decided to make the investigative referral.\nThe relevant counselling occurred at the meeting with Dr Laundy on 18 January 2000 and the Commission allowed Dr Saint until the end of March 2000 to demonstrate that he had made changes to his practice to meet the concerns expressed by at the meeting.\n69 It is apparent from that record of interview of 18 January 2000 that Dr Laundy outlined to Dr Saint that the Commission was concerned that the high level of services he was providing may mean that he was engaging in inappropriate practice.\nThe record of interview does record, as contended by Dr Saint, that Dr Laundy said that the Commission was not asking Dr Saint to reduce his services.\nHowever, it is also apparent, from the context in which Dr Laundy made that remark, that Dr Laundy was not thereby indicating that Dr Saint was at liberty to continue providing services at that level without the risk that his conduct would be referred to the Director and then to the Committee.\nThe meaning of Dr Laundy's comment was that the high level of services carried with it a risk that he may be found to be engaging in inappropriate practice, but any finding that Dr Saint had engaged in inappropriate practice was a matter to be assessed by the Committee and not the Commission; and that the response made by Dr Saint to the expression of the Commission's concern, was a matter for Dr Saint and not the Commission.\n70 Accordingly, in my view, the Commission complied with representation referred to in the newsletter, and, to the extent that the newsletter prescribed a procedure, the procedure so prescribed.\n71 In any event, even if the decision to make an investigative referral by reference to Dr Saint's statistics for the first quarter of 2000 was a departure by the Commission from the representation or procedure, there was, in my view, no failure to accord procedural fairness.\nThis is because Dr Saint did not suffer any practical unfairness by being denied an opportunity to make submissions as to why the effect should be given to the representation or procedure.\n The applicant rests his case upon the proposition that, if an administrative decision-maker states to a person affected an intention to take a certain procedural step, and fails to do so without warning the person affected of the change of intention, then the result is procedural unfairness warranting certiorari and prohibition.\nSuch a proposition is far too broad.\nThere are undoubtedly circumstances in which the failure of an administrative decision-maker to adhere to a statement of intention as to the procedure to be followed will result in unfairness and will justify judicial intervention to quash the decision; but for the present applicant to succeed it would be necessary to conclude that such a result will follow in all circumstances.\nThat cannot be correct.\nTo begin with, it overlooks the discretionary nature of the remedies of certiorari and prohibition.\n Fairness is not an abstract concept.\nIt is essentially practical.\nWhether one talks in terms of procedural fairness or natural justice, the concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice.\nNo practical injustice has been shown.\nThe applicant lost no opportunity to advance his case.\nHe did not rely to his disadvantage on the statement of intention.\nIt has not been shown that there was procedural unfairness.\nAnd, as I have already indicated, there is no warrant for a conclusion that there was a failure properly to take into account the interests of the applicant's children.\n74 Dr Saint said that the departure from the presentation or procedure without having an opportunity to make submissions, led to practical unfairness in three respects.\n75 First, it was said that the investigative referral was made on the basis that he had been given an opportunity to improve after counselling, when this was not the case.\nIt was Dr Saint's submission that the warning and accompanying opportunity to improve was only provided in Mr Garrity's letter of 23 March 2000.\nIt followed that, if effect had been given to the Commission's representation, the Commission should have reviewed his statistics for the period 23 March 2000 to 30 June 2000 - and not for the first quarter of 2000, which was the period reviewed by the Commission.\n76 The evidence does not support a finding that Dr Saint suffered any practical unfairness from the failure of the Commission to make an assessment by reference to Dr Saint's statistics for the period 23 March 2000 to 30 June 2000.\nSignificantly, Dr Saint did not depose that in reliance on the 23 March 2000 letter from Mr Garrity, he had substantially changed his pattern of delivering services during the second quarter of 2000 in an effort to satisfy the concerns of the Commission.\nFurther, there is no reference to Mr Garrity's letter of 23 March 2000 in the submissions which Dr Saint made to the Director in September 2000 to persuade him to dismiss the investigative referral.\nNor is there any reference in those submissions to having made adjustments to his practice during the second quarter of 2000 in an attempt to meet the concerns of the Commission.\nHad Dr Saint, in reliance upon Mr Garrity's letter, substantially changed his pattern of delivering services during the second quarter of 2000, one would have expected that he would have referred, in those submissions, to Mr Garrity's letter and the adjustments which he made to his practice consequent upon Mr Garrity's letter.\n77 It follows that even though the letter of 23 March 2000 by Mr Garrity was ambiguous and could be construed in the way Dr Saint contended in this case, the ambiguity of the letter led to no unfairness in respect of Dr Saint.\n78 Secondly, Dr Saint said he also suffered practical unfairness in not being able to make submissions to the delegate of the Commission because the investigative referral was made on the basis that he had been the subject of \"multiple\" or \"repeated\" counselling, when, as he recorded in his submissions to the Director, he had only been counselled twice --- namely, 29 October 1996 and 18 January 2000.\n79 In my view, Dr Saint suffered no practical unfairness by being deprived of the opportunity to point this out to the delegate of the Commission.\nThe Commission's representation in the newsletter only referred to one counselling occasion and an opportunity to improve.\nDr Saint accepted in his submissions to the Director (which were sent about a month after the Commission had made the investigative referral) that each of the interviews of 18 January 2000 and 29 October 1996 was a counselling occasion.\n80 In any event, the delegate had before her the interview reports of each of the three meetings which Dr Saint had with Dr Hertnon and Dr Laundy.\nIt was, therefore, open to the delegate to make her own characterisation of the content of the meetings which Dr Saint had with the Commission officers.\n81 Thirdly, in the course of oral submissions Dr Saint said that the practical unfairness arose because at the time that he made his submissions to the Director, Dr Saint did not know that the delegate of the Commission had based her referral on his statistics for the period January to March 2000 figures and not on his statistics for the second quarter of 2000.\nI do not accept that submission.\nFirst, there was no evidence from Dr Saint that he held that belief when he made his submissions to the Director.\nSecondly, it is apparent from a perusal of Table 5 of the investigative referral that the Commission had reviewed statistics only for the first quarter of 2000 and not for the second quarter of 2000.\nFurther, and significantly, Dr Saint, in his submissions in September 2000 to the Director, specifically referred to the statistics in that Table and expressly referred to the statistics for the \"first quarter of 2000\" when he compared those statistics with the statistics of \"the last two quarters of 1999\".\n[See [26] above].\nI infer, therefore, that in commenting in that fashion upon the statistics in Table 5, Dr Saint closely perused the Table and appreciated that the period covered by the statistics figures ended in with the statistics for the first quarter of 2000.\n82 For those reasons, in my view, Dr Saint suffered no practical unfairness, even if (contrary to my finding), by making an investigative referral on the basis of an assessment of Dr Saint's statistics for the first quarter of 2000, there was a departure by the Commission from its representation or procedure, in circumstances where Dr Saint was not given the opportunity to make submissions.\n83 Next, Dr Saint contended that in making the investigative referral Dr Mould, the delegate of the Commission, had improperly exercised power, because she failed to take into account Dr Saint's explanation for his level of servicing.\n84 Dr Saint said that he gave an explanation for his high levels of servicing during his discussions with Dr Laundy on 18 January 2000.\nHowever, Dr Saint said, the delegate's reasons refer only to an explanation for the high level of services \"having been sought\" in the interview of 18 January 2000, and the reasons make no reference to the content of Dr Saint's explanation.\nIt should be inferred, therefore, said Dr Saint, that his explanation was in fact not considered by the delegate of the Commission.\nFurther, Dr Saint said that Dr Mould's reasons did not manifest a \"proper, genuine and realistic consideration\" of Dr Saint's explanation for the high level of servicing.\n The Commission is obliged to take into account any explanation offered by the practitioner for what may be a temporary, and perhaps understandable breach of the [80/20 rule].\n86 Dr Saint contended that although the 80/20 rule referred to in the observations in Kelly was not applicable in this case, the referral was based upon statistics reflecting a high level of servicing by Dr Saint.\nTherefore, said Dr Saint, the observations were equally applicable to his circumstances.\n I accept for present purposes that Kelly v Daniel 134 FCR 64 is authority for the proposition that, in making a decision under s 86(1), the Commission is bound to take into account the consideration, where applicable, that the conduct of the person under review has already been considered by the Commission and a decision communicated to the person that the conduct will not be further investigated.\n88 Branson J went on to observe at [35] that any other factors the Commission was bound to take into account in making a decision under s 86(1) were to be determined as a matter of statutory construction.\nHer Honour observed that as the Act did not expressly identify the considerations to be taken into account they may be implied from the subject-matter, scope and purpose of the Act.\n89 I find it unnecessary to determine whether the Commission is required to take into account any statements made by a medical practitioner in an attempt to explain the level of services over the period in question, because I am satisfied that the delegate was aware of and took into account those statements.\n90 In her reasons for the investigative referral, the delegate referred to the 18 January 2000 meeting between Dr Saint and Dr Laundy, and referred specifically to the fact that an explanation had been sought from Dr Saint.\nDr Mould also referred to the fact that the record of interview of that meeting was an annexure to the referral.\nDr Mould also included in the annexure to the investigative referral, the correspondence between Dr Saint and the Commission which ensued subsequent to his meeting with Dr Laundy.\nAmong that correspondence was Dr Saint's letter of 5 February 2000 which expands upon the explanation given by Dr Saint at the meeting for his high levels of servicing.\nI infer from those facts (in particular, the inclusion as an annexure to the referral, Dr Saint's letter which expanded on Dr Saint's explanation given at the meeting) that the delegate was aware of, and took into account, the content of that material.\n91 I do not accept the contention of Dr Saint that in order for the delegate to comply with her statutory obligation it was necessary for her reasons to manifest a \"proper, genuine and realistic consideration\" of Dr Saint's explanation made to Dr Laundy.\n The appellant contended that there were three matters not taken into account by the Commission in making its investigative referral to the Director.\nFirst, the fact that the appellant had been counselled by the Commission's medical adviser in September 2000.\nSecond, the fact that the appellant had been counselled by the Director in December 2000.\nThird, that he had restructured his practice and reduced his rate of servicing.\nIn putting that submission, the appellant argued that the reasons given for the investigative referral, and in particular in para (c) of that referral, do not disclose that the Commission had regard to those three matters.\nIn my opinion, the absence of a mention of those three matters in the reasons does not mean that the Commission did not have regard to those matters.\nThe reasons which must be given by the Commission under s 86(4)(b) are \"the reasons why the Commission considers the person under review may have engaged in inappropriate practice\".\nThe Commission does not have to give reasons why it has decided to make an investigative referral but only the reasons why it considers the practitioner may have engaged in inappropriate practice.\nThe purpose of the Commission's reasons is to identify the matters into which the Director needs to inquire.\nIn my opinion, the reasons which were advanced by the Commission were appropriate having regard to the reasons which the Commission had to give.\nIn those circumstances, the appellant cannot, in my opinion, rely upon the Commission's failure to mention the three matters to which the appellant referred for arguing that the Commission failed to have regard to them.\n92 I, accordingly, reject the contention of Dr Saint that the delegate improperly exercised power by failing to take into account the explanation of Dr Saint.\n93 Dr Saint then contended that the scheme created by Pt VAA of the Act involved disciplinary proceedings, and therefore the Commission, in making the investigative referral, was required to act on adequate evidence of sufficient cogency to justify it \"being comfortably satisfied\" in respect of the decision to be made.\nDr Saint relied upon the case of Greyhound Racing Authority (NSW) v Bragg [2003] NSWCA 388 ( Bragg) .\nDr Saint went on to say that the delegate of the Commission took into account material which did not meet these requirements of adequacy and cogency and was, therefore, extraneous to the exercise of that power.\nThese matters were inaccurate statistics and the number of times Dr Saint had been counselled.\n94 In Bragg, Mr Bragg, a greyhound trainer, had faced disciplinary proceedings before the Regulatory Committee of the Greyhound Racing Authority (NSW) and, on appeal, the Greyhound Racing Appeals Tribunal.\nIt was the function of each of the Regulatory Committee and the Tribunal to make factual findings in respect of the charge against Mr Bragg, which was the serious charge of bribery.\nThe Regulatory Committee had imposed a penalty of 10 years disqualification and 10 penalty fine on Mr Bragg.\nThe Tribunal dismissed an appeal from the decision of the Regulatory Committee.\nMr Bragg challenged these decisions in the New South Wales Supreme Court by way of judicial review.\nHe was successful at first instance.\nThe Greyhound Racing Authority (NSW) appealed.\n [A]dequate evidence, informally obtained as it might be, of sufficient cogency to justify the Tribunal being comfortably satisfied in relation to the serious charge before it, with its grave consequences.\n96 Dr Saint contended that these observations also applied to the Commission when deciding to make an investigative referral.\n97 The function of the Tribunal in Bragg was to make factual findings in relation to a charge made against Mr Bragg of serious misconduct, and, if warranted, to impose penalties.\nBy contrast, the function of the Commission at the stage of making an investigative referral is confined to posing a question for investigation.\nIts function does not even include formulating a charge, much less making findings of fact in respect of a charge, as the Tribunal was required to do in Bragg .\n In this regard, it is significant, we think, that at the stage of the making of a referral of conduct, the Act in s 86 speaks in the language of posing a question: \n The Commission may...refer...the conduct...relating to... the question ...whether the person has engaged in inappropriate practice in connection with rendering of services.\n The statutory ingredients are thus clearly stated: what is referred, for inquiry is the question whether, by conduct in connection with rendering certain services, a person has engaged in \"inappropriate practice\".\nAt this initiating stage, the whole matter rests in inquiry rather than charge.\nA charge may never eventuate.\nFor one thing, the Director's initial capacity to dismiss may be invoked (ss 89(1)(a) and 93(a)).\n98 It follows that the policy considerations which underlie the observations by Santow JA in favour of a modified Brigginshaw principle, in respect of fact finding by the Greyhound Racing Appeals Tribunal, have no application to the Commission in making an investigative referral.\nThe Bragg case is distinguishable.\n99 It follows that I reject Dr Saint's challenge made on this ground.\n100 It was next contended that the investigative referral was invalid or defective because the conduct referred to was \"unspecified and unlimited\".\n Pursuant to subsection 87(1) of the Act, this investigative referral relates to services rendered and initiated by Dr Warren John Saint that were rendered and initiated during the 2 year period immediately preceding the date of this investigative referral and are: \n (i) all services provided within a specified location...[which location was identified]; \n (ii) all services provided within a specified period, namely on and from 1 January 1999 to and including 31 December 1999.\n The attached material is provided for information only and is not intended in any way to limit the conduct referred.\n(italics added).\n101 Mr Saint contended that the sentence in the investigative referral which is italicised above, is in the same terms as the sentence which was impugned in the Pradhan case and which led to the investigative referral in that case being declared invalid.\n102 Dr Saint recognized that since Pradhan there have been observations made by the Full Court in the case of Grey and in the case of Freeman v Health Insurance Commission [2004] FCAFC 335 ; (2004) 141 FCR 129 ( Freeman ) to the effect that the presence of the impugned sentence in an investigative referral did not lead to the investigative referral and subsequent process being invalid.\nHowever, Dr Saint contended that those decisions were made without the benefit of the decision in SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24 ; (2005) 228 CLR 294 ( SAAP ).\nDr Saint also said that the Full Court observations in Grey and Freeman were obiter.\n When, as here, the Court is considering the effect of legislative provisions, having as its object the protection of the public, a holding of nullification of the whole process from its beginning for purely formal reasons would occasion public inconvenience, a consequence which the Parliament would be unlikely to intend.\nTo this extent, we cannot, with respect, accept the general approach taken by Finn J in Pradhan.\n104 In Freeman , Kiefel J (with whom Marshall J agreed) identified several grounds for distinguishing the decision in Pradhan .\nOne ground was that the language of the investigative referral in Freeman was more specific than in Pradhan.\n105 Secondly, and more relevantly for this case, Kiefel J (with whom Marshall J agreed) observed at 142, at [41]-[42]:\n There is substance to the respondents' submissions that the statement is directed to the Director's powers of inquiry.\nIn particular s 89(1) of the Act enables the Director to consider services not referred to in the Commission's reasons, when determining whether a Committee could reasonably find that there has been inappropriate practice.\nThe Director may identify other relevant conduct by reference to the services and the focus of the inquiry might shift.\nThe nature of the Director's inquiry may extend beyond the matters referred to in the Commission's reasons.\nThere is however no denial of procedural fairness were the Director to identify other conduct as relevant.\nThe Director's report is required to identify that conduct to the person under review: see ss 93(6) and 94(3).\nThe ability of the Director to consider conduct other than that specified by the Commission and its relevance to the meaning of the statement were not considered in Pradhan v Holmes.\nUnderstood in the context of the Act, the statement did no more than remind the Director of the extent of his powers of inquiry.\nIt follows, in my respectful view, that the construction given by his Honour to the statement should not be applied.\n106 Thirdly, Kiefel J (with whom Marshall J agreed) adopted the observations of the Full Court in Grey referred to in [ 103 ] above and Downes J, the third member of the Full Court, also approved those observations.\n107 In SAAP , the High Court held that the failure of the Refugee Review Tribunal to comply with the procedure prescribed in s 424A of the Migration Act invalidated the decision of that Tribunal.\nDr Saint contended that the reasoning in that case applied equally to this case, such that a contravention to s 86(1) of the Act no matter in what form it occurred, invalidated the investigative referral, and the whole of the subsequent process.\n108 I do not accept Dr Saint's contention that the observations in Grey at [103] above which were followed in Freeman , are undermined by the subsequent High Court decision in SAAP .\nThe observations of the High Court in SAAP comprise an instance of the application of the principle in Project Blue Sky to the contravention of s 424A of the Migration Act.\nThe case of SAAP considers legislative intention in relation to the consequences of non-compliance with a different process enacted under a different Act.\nBy contrast, the Full Court in Grey applied the Project Blue Sky principles of statutory construction, to the same infringement of the same Act as is relied upon by Dr Saint in this case, and concluded that the defect, even if it is regarded as such, did not have an invalidating effect upon the statutory process.\nThe SAAP case is distinguishable.\n109 In my view, I am not justified in declining to apply the observations of two Full Courts, (as Dr Saint would have me do), whether they are obiter or not.\n110 Further, and in any event, in my view, Dr Saint's challenge on this ground also fails for the reasons referred to by Kiefel J (with whom Marshall J agreed) in Freeman referred to at [105] above.\n No procedural fairness \n111 Dr Saint also impugned the decision of the Director to make the adjudicative referral.\n112 Dr Saint contended that the power of the Director to make an adjudicative referral under s 93 was subject to the power to dismiss conferred by s 91 of the Act.\nDr Saint contended that the Director's consideration of whether to exercise his powers under s 91 of the Act was infected by a failure to accord procedural fairness, alternatively failure to observe mandatory procedures in the making of the investigative referral.\nThis, so it was contended, meant that Dr Saint was unable to make meaningful submissions to the Director in the exercise of his right under s 91 of the Act.\n113 It was said that the reasons for the investigative referral stated that after counselling the Commission had reviewed Dr Saint's practice statistics and that the Commission had determined that there had \"been insufficient change to remove the overall concerns expressed above\".\nIt is submitted that Dr Saint erroneously understood that this statement indicated that Dr Mould had considered the Dr Saint's statistics for the three months following 23 March 2000.\n114 As I have already found, the evidence does not support that submission.\nFirst, there was no evidence from Dr Saint that at the time of making his submissions to the Director he believed that Dr Mould had considered the statistics for the period from 23 March 2000 to 30 June 2000.\nIn fact, there is no reference in Dr Saint's affidavit evidence to him having ever made the submissions to the Director.\nThe submissions of September 2000 were tendered during the oral evidence given by Dr Saint at the trial.\n115 Secondly, as I have also already found, Table 5 of the report which was part of the investigative referral identified the statistics that were reviewed by the Commission.\nThere is no reference in those statistics to the statistics for the second quarter of 2000 -the statistics reviewed end at the first quarter of 2000.\nAs previously mentioned, Dr Saint commented specifically on Table 5 in his submissions.\n116 It was also contended that Dr Saint's ability to comment in a meaningful way was also affected by the fact that the statistics ruled on by the Commission were unreliable and inaccurate.\nI reject this contention.\nIn his submission to the Director, Dr Saint referred specifically to certain inaccuracies in the figures.\nHe also dealt with the question of the number of times he had been counselled.\n117 Dr Saint next contended that the Director's decision to make an adjudicative referral under s 93 of the Act was based on findings regarding clinically inappropriate use of drugs for which there was no evidence.\n118 In support of this contention, Dr Saint said that the Director had relied upon reports of investigations undertaken by Dr Christine Davidson, for the purposes of discharging his statutory duty of investigation under s 89(1) and that Dr Davidson's reports formed the basis for his opinion under s 93.\nDr Saint went on to contend that that Dr Davidson did not identify in her reports any evidence of inappropriate drug prescription by Dr Saint in relation to MBS item 35 and MBS item 36, whereas the Director had referred to inappropriate drug prescription in relation to MBS item 35 and MBS item 36 services.\nIt followed, said Dr Saint, that the Court should infer that there was no evidence for the Director's findings in relation to drug prescription by Dr Saint and/or those findings involved extreme irrationality or logicality.\n119 In my view, Dr Saint's contention is not to be accepted.\n120 As mentioned in [30] above, the Director's report to referred to four aspects of Dr Saint's practice to which the Committee should have regard when considering whether his conduct in connection with rendering MBS item 35 and 36 services may have constituted engaging in inappropriate practice.\nThe third aspect was \"prescribing drugs in the absence of accepted medical indications\".\n121 It is the case that the Director received reports of the investigations made by Dr Davidson in relation to the investigative referral.\nHowever, in his report, the Director expressly states that he has examined Dr Saint's clinical notes.\n (a) First, the Director, at paragraph 6 of his report, stated that the pharmaceutical benefits prescribing data in the investigative referral, indicated that Dr Saint prescribed a wide range of drugs at greater than the 75th percentile.\nThe Director made reference to the range of the drugs and stated that most notable were injectable vitamin B12 and iron, soluble asprin, pethidine and antibiotics.\nThe Director then said: \"The wide range of drugs prescribed at greater than the 75th percentile suggested that the issuing of a prescription was the most common means of closing a consultation.\nThis means of closing a consultation may be associated with rapid throughput, symptom oriented medical practice.\n\" (b) As to MBS Item 36: \"There were some indications of apparently clinically inappropriate use of antibiotics or other drugs....Morphine appeared to be used for migraine and antibiotics appeared to be used routinely for upper respiratory tract infections... .\nThe management plans appeared to be mostly confined to drugs.\n\" (c) As to MBS Item 35: \"Again there were some suggestions that drugs were not always prescribed for clinically acceptable reasons or in accordance with accepted medical practice.\n122 Dr Saint relied on s 5(1)(h) and (3) of the ADJR Act in support of this \"no evidence\" ground of review.\nIt has been held that those provisions of the ADJR do not apply to the expression of opinion ( Australian Retailers Association v Reserve Bank of Australia [2005] FCA 1707 ; (2005) 148 FCR 446 at 588).\n123 The Act did not require that the Director make any findings of fact, in relation to making the adjudicative referral.\nSection 91 of the Act provides that the enquiry which the Director must make is whether there are sufficient grounds on which the Committee \"could reasonably find that the person under review has engaged in inappropriate practice.\n\" Section 93(6) provides that in his report to the Committee, the Director must give reasons why the Director \"thinks that conduct by the person under review....may have constituted engaging in inappropriate practice.\n124 The impugned observations of the Director's are not stated as facts which have been found.\nThe Director's observations are couched in language of opinion as to findings that may be open to the Committee.\nFor example, the Director refers to \"indications of apparently clinically inappropriate use of antibiotics or other drugs\" and \"some suggestions that drugs were not always prescribed for clinically acceptable reasons or in accordance with accepted medical practice\".\nThe Director's observations are, in my view, the expression of professional opinion based on what he said he had examined, namely, the pharmaceutical benefits prescribing data recorded in the investigative referral, Dr Saint's clinical notes and the reports of Dr Davidson.\nIt follows that I reject the \"no evidence\" ground of review relied upon by Dr Saint.\n125 Dr Saint also contended that findings of the Director involved extreme irrationality or illogicality.\nAs previously mentioned, there is reference in the Director's report to having examined the pharmaceutical benefits prescribing data in the investigative referral which recorded that Dr Saint prescribed a wide range of drugs at greater than the 75 th percentile.\nFurther, the Director stated that he had examined the clinical notes of Dr Saint.\nThere is, in my view, no basis for concluding that the views expressed by the Director were irrational or illogical.\nI do not, therefore, accept the contention of Dr Saint.\n126 Dr Saint also submitted that he relied on the accuracy of the Director's reasons to prepare his defence at the hearing before the Committee and this led to him being denied procedural fairness before the Committee.\nNeither in his oral nor his written submissions did Dr Saint refer to any passages in his evidence which identified the part of the Director's report he relied upon in the preparation of his defence.\nNor was any reference made as to how he was prejudiced in that regard.\nAccordingly, I reject that ground of review.\n127 In any event, the question of whether a party has been denied procedural fairness must be assessed by reference to the whole process ( Phan v Kelly (2007) 158 FCR 75) ( Phan ).\nThe evidence discloses that Dr Saint had legal representation at the hearing before the Committee, that he was provided with a draft report by the Committee which clearly identified the issues in respect of which he was at risk of an adverse finding and that he made very extensive submissions in response to the draft report.\n128 Dr Saint also impugned the process and decision of the Committee.\n129 Dr Saint contended that the Committee had allowed matters outside the scope of the adjudicative referral to infect its findings in the final report.\n130 Dr Saint contended that the Committee had no power to have regard to the time that Dr Saint had spent in consultation with patients, because the adjudicative referral had not referred the question of whether Dr Saint had applied the correct MBS descriptor to the services he provided.\nHowever, said Dr Saint, the Committee had inquired into these matters and it should be inferred that the Committee has allowed these matters \"to infect its final decision\".\nThe relevance of the issue arises because MBS item 36 prescribes a consultation period of at least 20 minutes.\n131 In support of this contention, Dr Saint sought to rely upon statements made by Dr Ruse, the content of the draft report which contained references to the time taken by Dr Saint in consultations with patients, and the content of the final report, which did not contain those references.\nDr Saint also relied upon evidence of the communications that took place between Ms Horler and members of the Committee before the preparation of the final report.\n132 Dr Saint asked the Court to draw an inference from this evidence that despite the final report making no reference to the time Dr Saint had spent in consultation with patients than this matter had \"infected\" the Committee's decision in its final report.\n133 I have already held at [59] above, that the evidence purporting to expose the manner in which the Committee reached its decision is inadmissible for the purpose of impugning the decision.\nIn the absence of that evidence, there is no basis for drawing the inference contended for by Dr Saint.\nIn any event, even if that evidence had been admissible, I would not have found that the Committee's decision was based on any consideration, other than those expressed in its reasons.\n134 Accordingly, I do not accept Dr Saint's contention that the Committee had allowed matters outside the scope of the adjudicative referral to infect its final decision.\n135 Next, Dr Saint contended that the Committee failed to discharge its statutory function because it \"did not meet to:\n (a) discuss and form a final view on the services they examined at the hearing and about which they had concerns; \n (b) consider the draft report (which purported to be a unanimous report); \n (c) consider [Dr Saint's] submissions to the draft report; or \n (d) draft or consider the final report (which purported to be a unanimous report).\n136 In my view, the Act does not require the Committee to meet to perform the functions referred to by Dr Saint in the preceding paragraph.\nSection 160KD of the Act provides that the Committee \"prepare a written draft report\".\nLikewise, s 106L provides that after the expiry of the requisite period and after taking into account any submissions made in response to the draft report, the Committee must \"prepare a final report\".\nIn neither of these sections is there any requirement that the Committee meet to prepare, or meet in relation to the preparation of, either of the reports.\nThe Act does, however, deal with the convening of meetings.\nSection 97(1) of the Act requires that the chairperson must convene the first meeting of the Committee within 14 days after the appointment of the Committee members.\nThe fact that the Act expressly identifies only one occasion when a meeting is required to be held, namely, the first meeting, but has not expressly provided for the holding of a meeting in relation to the preparation of either report, is indicative of a legislative intention that it is no absolute requirement for the Committee to meet to perform those functions.\nWhether meetings, other than the first meeting, are to be held depends on what is necessary for the efficient conduct of the affairs of the Committee (s 97(3)).\nBy legislating for the preparation of the two reports as part of the function of the Committee, without also specifying that the Committee must meet in relation to the performance of this function, it is apparent that the legislature did not intend that the efficient conduct of the Committee's affairs mandated that the Committee meet to carry out this function.\n137 Further, Dr Saint relied upon the following observations of Fox J in Minister for Health v Thomson [1985] FCA 208 ; (1985) 8 FCR 213 at 217.\nIt is not disputed that the Committee is one of experts.\nThe Act requires that it comprise five medical practitioners.\nIt seems reasonably clear that the intention of the Act is that the Committee sit as a Committee of the peers of the medical practitioner whose conduct is in question and exercise its own judgment in relation to the evidence before it, using its own collective knowledge in its evaluation.\n138 These observations are in general terms and in my view have no application to the point in issue.\n139 Accordingly, I dismiss this ground of review.\n140 I would, however, add that, in support of this ground of review, Dr Saint again sought to rely upon evidence seeking to expose the process whereby the Committee prepared its draft report and its final report.\nAs previously mentioned, I have found that evidence is inadmissible for the purpose relied upon by Dr Saint.\nIn the absence of that evidence there is no basis on which I could have drawn any inference that the Committee had not met for the purposes referred to by Dr Saint.\n141 Dr Saint then contended that the Committee had applied the wrong test in assessing whether Dr Saint had maintained adequate and contemporaneous records because it had not applied the statutory test.\n142 The Committee in its final report found that the statutory definition of adequate record keeping in s 82(3) and s 81(1) of the Act as supplemented by the Health Insurance (Professional Services Review) Regulations 1999 ( Cth ) (the Regulations), did not apply to the conduct of Dr Saint under review.\nThis was because, so the Committee said, the relevant legislative provisions only became effective on 1 November 1999, and the conduct under review predated those sections.\n Although there was no obligation under the Act for Dr Saint to keep adequate medical records before this time, [the Committee] states that in keeping with the expectations of the general body of general practitioners, there was a professional necessity.\nThe Committee considers that the subsequent introduction of this legislation essentially codified existing standards of the general body of practitioners.\n143 Dr Saint contended that the transitional provisions of the amending Act which introduced the record keeping provisions state that those record keeping provisions apply in respect of investigative referrals which were made after the effective date of the amending Act.\nIn this case, the investigative referral was made after November 1999.\nTherefore, said Dr Saint, the Committee should have applied the statutory record keeping provisions.\n144 Dr Saint went on to say that, even if the Committee was right in finding that the record keeping provisions introduced with effect from 1 November 1999 did not apply to conduct engaged in before that date, some of Dr Saint's conduct which the Committee inquired into, post-dated 1 November 1999.\nSo, even on the view taken by the Committee, the record keeping provisions of the Act and Regulations should have been applied by the Committee to that conduct.\n A Committee must, in determining whether a practitioner's conduct in connection with rendering or initiating services was inappropriate practice, have regard to (as well as to other relevant matters) whether or not the practitioner kept adequate and contemporaneous records of the rendering or initiation of the services.\n adequate and contemporaneous records of the rendering or initiation of services means records that meet the standards prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this definition.\n An adequate record For the definition of adequate and contemporaneous records in section 81 of the Act, the standard to be met in order that a record of service rendered or initiated be adequate is that: \n (a) the record clearly identify the name of the patient; and \n (b) the record contain a separate entry for each attendance by the patient for a service and the date on which the service was rendered or initiated; and \n (c) each entry provide clinical information adequate to explain the type of service rendered or initiated; and \n (d) each entry be sufficiently comprehensible that another practitioner, relying on the record, can effectively undertake the patient's ongoing care.\n148 Regulation 6 provides:\n A contemporaneous record For the definition of adequate and contemporaneous records in section 81 of the Act, the standard to be met in order that a record of a service rendered or initiated be contemporaneous, is that the record must be completed: \n (a) at the time the practitioner rendered or initiated the service; or \n (b) as soon as practicable after the service was rendered or initiated by the practitioner.\n149 At subparagraphs 38(c),(d) and (e) of the final report, the Committee said:\n (c) ...The Committee considers that adequate medical records are considered by the general body of general practitioners to be a significant component of the clinical input expected when using this item number and as such should be sufficient to facilitate the: &#8226; monitoring and modification of ongoing conditions; &#8226; recall of conditions, problems and treatment after any substantial period; and &#8226; enable another practitioner to assume care of the patient, if necessary.\n&#8226; the presenting complaint;\n&#8226; a relevant medical history;\n&#8226; an examination;\n&#8226; a differential diagnosis;\n&#8226; a management plan; and\n&#8226; an evaluation of the patient at each presentation.\n(e) The Committee considers that a clinical record would not be adequate unless it contained the elements outlined in points (c) and (d) above, and in its opinion, Dr Saint's records did not.\n150 In my view, even if the Committee erred in law in concluding that the record keeping provisions did not apply to the conduct referred to it in the adjudicative referral, the Committee, nevertheless, applied the standard articulated in the statutory provisions in assessing whether Dr Saint had kept adequate medical records.\nThere was, therefore, no error of law in the application of the correct standard for record keeping.\nHowever, if I am wrong in this characterisation and there was such an error of law made by the Committee, the error made no difference to the outcome for Dr Saint because there was no material difference in the standards and, therefore, I would in the exercise of my discretion withhold relief in respect of that error ( VAAD v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCAFC 117).\n151 The standard of adequate record keeping referred to Regulation 5(c) is that the entry provides \"clinical information adequate to explain the type of service rendered or initiated\" (emphasis added).\nThe standard referred to in Regulation 5(d) is that the entry be \" sufficiently comprehensible that another practitioner relying on the record, can effectively undertake the patient's ongoing case\" (emphasis added).\n152 The use of the language in the terms italicised manifests a parliamentary intention that the Committee is to determine the adequacy of records by reference to the standard of the general body of general practitioners.\nThus, for example, Reg 5(d) requires that the Committee is to determine whether the record was adequate by reference to what the general body of general practitioners would regard as an entry that was \"sufficiently comprehensible\" to permit another practitioner relying on the record to effectively undertake the patient's ongoing care.\nThe standard set out in subparas 38(c),(d) and (e) of its final report, by the Committee is the standard of the general body of general practitioners.\nAccordingly, when the Committee assessed the adequacy of Dr Saint's records, it assessed them by reference to the statutory standard described in the Act and Regulations, notwithstanding that it did not expressly recognize that it was doing so.\n153 It follows that I reject Dr Saint's challenge founded on this ground of review.\n154 Next, Dr Saint contended that in making findings in relation to inadequate record keeping, the Committee failed to distinguish between failing to provide an adequate clinical input and failing to keep a record of such input as the practitioner did make.\nThus, for example, it was contended that if the input was deficient then that might constitute failing to provide adequate clinical input, but failing to record what was not provided would not comprise failing to keep a proper record.\n155 The Committee found that in respect of all 14 services where in its opinion there was inappropriate practice, Dr Saint kept inadequate records.\nIn respect of eight of those services, the Committee also found that Dr Saint had failed to provide an adequate clinical input.\nThere were, therefore, six services in respect of which the Committee's finding of inappropriate practice was founded only on the basis of inadequate record keeping.\nThese were services Nos 7, 16, 18, 21, 29 and 36.\n156 In my view, the Committee did not fall into the error which Dr Saint said that it did.\n157 I have reviewed each of the six services in respect of which the finding of inappropriate practice was based only on a finding of keeping inadequate records.\nI am satisfied that in making the findings the Committee was aware of, and applied, the distinction to which Dr Saint has referred.\nIt is not necessary to refer to all of these services to demonstrate the Committee's appreciation of the distinction.\nIt will suffice to illustrate the point that I refer to some of the findings in respect of these services, by way of example.\n This was a 91 year-old woman being treated with Coversal and Urex for heart failure.\nDr Saint advised that the patient had told him her shortness of breath had been increasing over the previous few weeks and that she was having pain in her legs.\nThese are important positive symptoms that were not recorded.\n158 By this finding, the Committee has demonstrated that the vice was Dr Saint's failure to record what he had been told by the patient.\n The records kept for this consultation were inadequate.\nIf Dr Saint did perform the examination which he stated he did, it was equally important to record the significant positives and negatives.\n160 In relation to patient 18, the Committee found that Dr Saint was aware that the patient had a carer, but found that Dr Saint had not recorded that fact in the Health Summary.\n This consultation was one in the sequence in which Dr Saint agreed he had tried to provide comprehensive care to a difficult patient.\nSuch patients may need to be seen by another doctor at short notice and in conditions where a full and accurate history cannot be easily obtained.\nThe fact that the necessity for a cross check with the carer was not recorded in the Health Summary and that he kept those important details in his head would be unacceptable to the general body of general practitioners.\n No record in the clinical notes of the quantum of increase in methadone dosage, which Dr Saint clearly recalls in his supplementary submission.\n In his supplementary submission, Dr Saint transcribes his clinical notes as \"pt has need of review wt 74kg methadone 8/7/99-8/8/99...Hep C/HIV\".\nDr Saint recalled but did not record that the patient was concerned about her skin.\nIf he did perform an examination, it was not recorded.\n163 Accordingly, Dr Saint's contention is not accepted.\n164 Dr Saint also contended that the findings of inappropriate practice were based on \"minor record keeping transgressions of the record keeping test it adopted\".\nIt was said that the Committee's finding that inadequate record keeping alone was sufficient to amount to inappropriate practice, was contrary to s 82(3) of the Act.\nThis was because that section required that the keeping of the practitioner's records was just a relevant matter that had to be considered in conjunction with other relevant matters.\nIt could not by itself found a finding of inappropriate practice.\n165 In my view, the intention of s 82(3) of the Act is to emphasise, not diminish, the importance Parliament placed on the requirement that a medical practitioner keep adequate and contemporaneous records.\nThe addition of the bracketed words \" (as well as to other relevant matters) \" in that section is not to be regarded as a requirement that a finding of inappropriate practice in respect of record keeping can only be made in conjunction with one or more other incidents of practice which would amount to inappropriate practice.\nThe additional words are there to emphasise that record keeping is not the only matter to which the Committee should have regard in assessing inappropriate practice.\n166 Dr Saint also contended that the sampling methodology adopted by the Committee did not comply with the Act.\n167 First, it was contended that the departure by the Committee from the methodology which had been specified in the written determination made by the Minister pursuant to s 106K(3) had not been authorised.\nThis is because the advice given by Professor Nicholls did not comprise advice of the nature contemplated by s 106K(4).\n The Committee may use a sampling methodology that is not specified in such a determination if and only if the Committee has been advised by a statistician accredited by the Statistical Society of Australia Inc that the sampling methodology is statistically valid.\n169 Dr Saint contended that the advice provided by Dr Nicholls was not advice contemplated by the section because the letter was not addressed to the methodology as a whole; and that it was the \"conclusion\", as opposed to the methodology as a whole, which was certified as statistically valid.\nDr Saint said that s 106K(4) should not be construed to permit the use of, what Dr Saint referred to as, \"ad hoc\" methodology or the \"salvaging\" of a partially completed sampling methodology set out in the Determination.\n Re: Request of 4 March 2004 From the information supplied I note: &#8226; From the 17,970 item 23 services a random sample of 84 services have been examined (with 4 services being disregarded due to no records).\nThe Committee found that of the remaining 80 services, 69 or 86% (rounded down) were considered inappropriate.\n&#8226; Applying appropriate statistical techniques it can be shown that we can be 95% confident that the true percentage of inappropriate practice lies between 86% +/- 8%, that is the lower 95% confident limit is 78%.\nThis value (78%) is to be chosen as the level of inappropriate practice (rather than 86%).\nIn conclusion, it is statistically valid to accept the conclusion based on the sample of 80 item 23 services that the level of inappropriate practice will be determined as 78%.\nI confirm that I am a statistician accredited by the Statistical Society of Australia Inc. as required under subsection 106K(4) of the Act.\n171 There is, in my view, no relevant distinction between the nature of the certification given by Dr Nicholls in this case and that which he gave in relation to Phan .\nFurther as he did, in Phan , Professor Nicholls stated in his report in this case, that the \"approach\" adopted by the Committee was statistically valid (Para 8 of Professor Nicholls' report dated 22 September 2006).\n172 Dr Phan made an argument as to the defective nature of Professor Nicholls' opinion on similar lines to that made by Dr Saint in this case.\n He refers to the fact that one course of sampling action had been taken and a second course was then adopted in the analysis of the results in order to salvage the incorrect implementation of the first.\n The principal difficulty with this challenge to the sampling process is that s 106K(4) of the Act specifically contemplates that the Committee can make use of an alternative sampling methodology to that prescribed in s 106K(3) if it has been advised by a statistician accredited by the Statistical Society of Australia Inc that the alternative sampling method is statically valid.\nProfessor Nicholls' response to Ms Goodspeed's email dated 5 March 2004 clearly certifies that it was statistically valid for the Committee to accept the conclusion, based on a sample using 80 item 23 services, that the level of inappropriate practice would be determined at 78%.\n174 Tamberlin J was, accordingly, satisfied that the language Professor Nicholls used in his letter that it was \"statistically valid to adopt the conclusion\" based on the alternative methodology referred to in the letter, was sufficient compliance with s 106K(4) of the Act.\n175 Dr Saint also argued that the Determination is contained in a legislative instrument and this should be construed as indicative of a legislative intention to preclude the use of \"ad hoc\" methodologies which were not adopted before initial sampling was undertaken.\nI do not accept this submission because the legislature has by s 106K(4) expressly provided in the Act that there may be a departure from the Determination and there is nothing in s 106K(4) which places any limitation on the nature of the alternative sampling methodology that may be validated by the statistician, or at what stage it may be validated ( Phan at [58]).\n176 Accordingly, I will follow Phan and hold that a certification in the terms given by Professor Nicholls in this case fell with the ambit of s 106K(4) of the Act.\n177 Further or alternatively, Dr Saint contended \"as in Mathews v HIC (2006) 90 ALD 49 ( Mathews ) the selection of the first services from the preliminary sample meant that those services were not randomly chosen from that preliminary sample\".\nIt followed, said Dr Saint, that the final report was invalid.\n178 The Mathews' case is distinguishable.\nIn Mathews , the Court was concerned with a different fact situation.\nIn essence the Determination provides for a two stage process of producing the random sample of services which is examined by the Committee.\nThe drawing of the sample known as the \"preliminary random sample\" is the first stage.\nThe second is the drawing of the sample which is referred to as the \"exploratory sample\".\nThis is a sample which is randomly drawn from the \"preliminary random sample\".\n179 In Mathews the Committee had examined the first 30 services on the list of the preliminary sample.\nMr Clark deposed that he had examined the computer files relating to the drawing of the samples in Dr Saint's case which were stored on the Commission's computer and by reason of that examination was able to say that the Commission by the application of the computer program randomly selected the \"preliminary random sample\", then by the application of the computer program, randomly selected from that preliminary sample the \"exploratory random sample\" of the 40 services.\n180 In support of his contention, Dr Saint relied upon paragraph 7 of Dr Henstridge's affidavit of 5 December 2006.\nHowever, Dr Henstridge's evidence does not demonstrate that the sampling in Dr Saint's case exhibited the vice referred to in in Mathews .\nNor does Dr Henstridge's evidence challenge the evidence of Mr Clark that the explanatory random sample was randomly selected in the manner described by Mr Clark.\nDr Saint accepted that the question of how the explanatory sample was drawn was a factual question which turned on whether Mr Clark's evidence should be accepted.\n181 Dr Saint submitted, that I should not accept the evidence of Mr Clark because there is an insufficient foundation laid for his evidence that in this case, namely Dr Saint's case, the Committee examined an \"exploratory sample\" that had been randomly drawn by the application of the Commission's computer program from the \"preliminary sample\".\nI do not accept that submission.\nMr Clark deposed that he went back to the file stored on the Commission's computer to examine how the sampling had occurred in relation to Dr Saint's case and that based on that examination, he expressed the view set out above.\nIn my view, that evidence affords Mr Clark a sufficient basis upon which to express the view that he expressed.\n182 In my view, therefore, that the Mathews' case has no application to this case.\nIt follows that I do not accept Dr Saint's contention.\n183 It follows that Dr Saint's application is dismissed.\nRulings on

        "description": "1 The appellant is a partnership comprising Mr Glenn McKenzie and his wife, Mrs Teresa McKenzie.\nIn May 2002, a company, Grant Caple Pty Ltd, the first respondent to the originating application (the first respondent), carried on business as a stockist and seller of a range of nailing and stapling hardware to the building, cabinet-making and furniture-making businesses.\nThe business was carried on from premises at Unit 4, 42 Farrall Road, Midvale in the State of Western Australia.\nOn 16 May 2002, the appellant entered into a contract to purchase the business from the first respondent.\nThe shareholders and directors of the first respondent were Mr Grant Caple, the second respondent to the originating application (the second respondent) and his wife, Mrs Michelle Caple, the fifth respondent to the originating application (the fifth respondent).\nThe business premises were owned by Mr and Mrs Caple as co-owners.\n2 The appellant agreed to pay $150,000 for the business.\nAs part of the purchase, the appellant also agreed to be novated as a party to existing financial leases between the first respondent and credit providers in relation to three motor vehicles which were used in the business.\nThese three motor vehicles were a 1999 Ford Explorer, a 1998 Ford station wagon and a 1999 Falcon station wagon.\nIn addition, the appellant entered into a lease of the business premises in Midvale on the purchase of the business.\nThe contract for the purchase of the business was completed on 28 June 2002.\n3 The purchase of the business proved an unsuccessful venture for the appellant.\nOn 20 December 2002, the appellant commenced an originating application in the Federal Magistrates Court claiming damages pursuant to s 82 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) (the TPA).\nIn an amended application, the appellant alleged that the first respondent had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in contravention of s 52 of the TPA and that the second and fifth respondents were each knowingly involved in contraventions of the TPA by the first respondent.\n4 No appearance to the service of the originating application was filed by or on behalf of the second respondent, whose relationship with the fifth respondent had broken down and who had by that time, left Australia to live in Thailand.\nOn 19 March 2003, an order was made by Federal Magistrate Raphael that judgment be entered for the appellant against the second respondent in default of his filing an appearance, for damages to be assessed.\n5 On 21 November 2003, the appellant sold the business for $37,692.19.\n6 In May 2004, there was a trial before Federal Magistrate McInnis of the claim made against the fifth respondent.\nThe trial was limited to the question of the fifth respondent's liability.\nThe appellant alleged that in purchasing the business, the partners had relied upon statements contained in a sales document which had been prepared by the business agent engaged by the first respondent.\nThe sales document stated that the first respondent had developed customer loyalty through regular visits by sales representatives, which was successful because it was a contact business where customers were visited, orders taken and personal relationships developed.\nIt was said that direct calling by sales representatives accounted for approximately 80% of the sales of the first respondent.\nThe sales document also stated that one of the sales representatives, Mr McCaughan, was leaving the business to retire and would be leaving the industry.\n7 There was also a representation in the sales document that some of the stock of the business comprised nails that were imported from Thailand which were of no lesser quality than those from other suppliers, but would provide a substantially better profit margin.\n8 The trial lasted two days.\nEach of Mr and Mrs McKenzie gave evidence and was cross-examined.\nThe Federal Magistrate found that the first respondent had engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct in that it had failed to disclose that Mr McCaughan, the sales representative who had resigned, was intending to commence employment with a direct competitor of the first respondent, and that there had been problems with the quality of the stock of nails from Thailand.\nThe Federal Magistrate found that the fifth respondent was knowingly involved in the misleading or deceptive conduct of the first respondent, and entered judgment against the fifth respondent for damages to be assessed.\n9 The hearing for the assessment of damages occurred on 17 May 2005 before Federal Magistrate McInnis.\nBy that time, there was an order made by Federal Magistrate Raphael on 19 March 2003 that damages be assessed in respect of the default judgment obtained against the second respondent, and the order of Federal Magistrate McInnis in respect of the liability of the fifth respondent.\nAt that hearing, the appellant relied upon the affidavits of Mrs Teresa Lea McKenzie sworn 5 March 2004 and 23 February 2005, and the affidavits of Mauro Federico, an accountant, sworn 4 March 2004 and 24 February 2005.\nEach of the deponents was cross-examined on their affidavits at the hearing on 17 May 2005 - although only the cross-examination of Mrs McKenzie is in the appeal book.\n10 The appellant claimed damages of $200,000, being the maximum under the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Court.\nThe appellant claimed damages in respect of capital loss, trading losses, financing costs, income forgone and losses arising from the purchase of the motor vehicles which the appellant acquired as part of the business.\nThe appellant also claimed an order under s 87(2)(c) of the TPA for the refund of $11,706.70 in respect of the rent paid to the second and fifth respondents for the lease of the Midvale business premises.\n11 Between the date of the hearing on 17 May 2005 and the delivery of the judgment in December 2005, the fifth respondent succeeded in an appeal against the decision of Federal Magistrate McInnis that she was liable for damages to be assessed.\nAccordingly, when Federal Magistrate McInnis made orders in respect of the quantum of damages to be paid, those orders were made only against the second respondent.\nIt is in respect of those orders that this appeal is brought.\n12 The Federal Magistrate ordered that the second respondent pay by way of damages the sum of $90,000, representing primarily the capital loss suffered by the appellant, adjusted to take account of his finding that the partners of the appellant elected to conduct the business \"at a lower level than it could have been run\", and to reflect other factors, including the benefit derived from the sale of two of the motor vehicles.\n There were criticisms made during the course of the hearing in this matter of the manner in which the [appellant] conducted the business.\nIt is important to at least make some allowance for that conduct which may lead a court to conclude that it was not conducted in a way which might have attracted a better \"sale price\".\nOf course in the assessment of damages it is difficult to make a precise finding in relation to that but rather simply make some allowance by way of reduction to the damages claimed.\n14 Further McInnis FM observed at [22]:\n I am satisfied the business would not have been purchased had the representations not been made, and therefore am prepared to conclude that the damages by way of capital loss have been sustained.\nI am not prepared however to accept that the total amount of capital loss of $106,114.18 is an appropriate amount of damages and I make some allowance for what might be described as the less than efficient conduct of the business on the evidence before me by the [appellant].\nA further reduction should be made for transactions including the acquisition and sale of at least two of the three vehicles.\nDoing the best I can on the material before me, I am prepared to find that there has been a capital loss constituting damages, which I assess at $90,000.\n15 At [23] the Federal Magistrate also said:\n I accept in this instance the downturn in the business occurred soon after the purchase and I do not find that there has been a contrived downturn in the business caused by the [appellant].\nRather I accept, as indicated, that a loss and damage has occurred in the nature of a capital loss arising from the purchase and sale of this business.\nThe sale in itself, I am satisfied, was appropriate in order for the [appellant] to mitigate the loss, and that the loss as found was caused by the claimed contravention of the s 52 of the TPA by the Second Respondent.\n16 The Federal Magistrate rejected the appellant's claims for trading losses of $74,090.88.\n I apply the principles set out in the decision of the Federal Court in Starborne Holdings Pty Ltd v Radferry Pty Ltd where the Court held an Applicant is not entitled to recover damages from trading losses from having elected to operate a business at a lower level than it could have been run.\n(Footnote omitted.\n17 The Federal Magistrate also rejected the appellant's claim in respect of losses in relation to the motor vehicles, and loss of income forgone by reason of unrewarded work in the business, and financing costs.\n Whilst I accept the assessment of damages in this instance may reflect a somewhat robust approach, I should add that it is not for the court to merely accept all the damages claimed in circumstances where it is clear that the Court's duty is not to make a damages order for all losses, where it may well be that some of those losses do not arise directly out of the contravention of the TPA by the Second Respondent.\nIt is clear that in the conduct of a business that other losses were sustained and adjustments made, though the substantive loss, I am satisfied, which justifies the assessment of damages in the sum of $90,000 is for the capital loss, and that in my view, is sufficient compensation for the [appellant] in this application.\n19 The Federal Magistrate also declined to make any separate order under s 87(2)(c) of the TPA in the amount of $11,706.70 by way of refund of the rent paid, as value was delivered to the appellant for the payment of rent.\n20 It was contended that the Federal Magistrate erred by refusing to award the amount claimed in respect of trading losses and by making an adjustment in the capital loss, because there \"was no evidence to support\" the finding that the appellant elected to run the business at a lower level than it could have been run (Grounds 2 and 3 of the appeal).\nThe appellant also contended that the Federal Magistrate erred in not awarding damages in respect of the other heads of damages claimed, which said the appellant, were items of loss that occurred as a direct consequence of the contravening conduct, and therefore, compensable in accordance with the causation principles espoused by the High Court in Henville v Walker [2001] HCA 52 ; (2006) 206 CLR 459 ( Henville ).\n21 I deal firstly with the appellant's contention that the Federal Magistrate erred in not awarding trading losses and in reducing the amount of capital loss.\n22 In Gould v Vaggelas [1985] HCA 75 ; (1983) 157 CLR 215 ( Gould ), Gibbs CJ recognised that in actions for deceit, trading losses could, in certain circumstances, be recovered in addition to a capital loss.\n There is no reason in principle why the defrauded purchaser should not recover damages for all the loss that flowed directly from the fraudulent inducement (unless, possibly, the loss was not foreseeable).\nIf the purchaser, besides paying more for the business than it was worth, has suffered additional losses which resulted directly from the fraud he ought to be compensated for them.\nOf course, the court must be satisfied that the loss did result directly from the fraud and not from some supervening cause such as the folly, error or misfortune of the purchaser himself, and must ensure that no additional compensation is given for losses when those losses, or the probability of their occurrence, has already been taken into account in determining the value of the business.\n(Footnotes omitted.\n23 In the case of Kizbeau Pty Limited v W G &amp; B Pty Limited [1995] HCA 4 ; (1995) 184 CLR 281 ( Kizbeau ), the High Court observed at 290-291:\n Actions based on s 52 are analogous to actions for torts.\nIt follows that, in assessing damages under s 82 of the Act, the rules for assessing damages in tort, and not the rules for assessing damages in contract, are the appropriate guide in most, if not all, cases.\nIn an action for damages for deceit for inducing a person to enter a contract of purchase, which is an action that is closely analogous to an action for damages for breach of s 52, the courts have consistently held that the proper measure of damages is the difference between the real value of the thing acquired as at the date of acquisition and the price paid for it.\nNevertheless, although the value is assessed as at the date of the acquisition, subsequent events may be looked at in so far as they illuminate the value of the thing as at that date.\nA distinction is drawn, however, between subsequent events that arise from the nature or use of the thing itself and subsequent events that affect the value of the thing but arise from sources supervening upon or extraneous to the fraudulent inducement.\nEvents falling into the former category are admissible to prove the value of the thing, those falling into the latter category are inadmissible for that purpose.\nThus, the takings of a business subsequent to purchase are generally admissible, not only to prove that a representation concerning the takings was false but also to prove the true value of the business as at the date of purchase.\nEven when some difference exists between the conditions under which the business was conducted before and after purchase, evidence of subsequent takings may be admissible, \"subject to due allowance being made for any differences in relevant conditions\".\nBut if it is established that the decline in takings has been caused by business ineptitude or unexpected competition, evidence of subsequent takings is not admissible to prove the value of the business as at that date, events such as ineptitude and unexpected competition being regarded as supervening events.\nIn some cases of deceit, it may also be proper to compensate the defrauded party not only for the difference between the value of the thing acquired and the price paid for it but also for losses induced by the fraud and directly incurred in conducting the business.\nAll of these principles are appropriate to the assessment of damages under s 82 where a breach of s 52 of the Act has induced a person to purchase a business.\n24 There was no evidence produced by the appellant as to the value of the business at the date of purchase.\nThus, the Federal Magistrate was not in a position to apply the usual measure of damages referred to by the High Court in Kizbeau , namely, the difference between the price paid and the value of the business as at the date of purchase.\nThe appellant claimed capital loss of $106,114.18 on the basis of the difference between the price paid for the business in June 2002 and the price obtained for the business when it was sold in November 2003.\nIn assessing the damages generally, and capital loss in particular, the Federal Magistrate had to do the best he could with the evidence which was available to him.\nAlthough the Kizbeau approach is the preferred, or usual approach, to assessing damages, it is not the only approach available to give effect to the general rule which is to seek to to put the applicant into the position he or she would have been but for the contravening conduct ( HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 54 ; (2004) 217 CLR 640 at 663).\n25 The Federal Magistrate's approach to trading losses, although not articulated in this way, can be explained as follows.\nInsofar as the trading losses claimed by the appellant arose from causes inherent in the business, in accordance with the observations of Gibbs CJ in Gould , the Federal Magistrate took them into account in assessing the \"true value\" of the business, when making his award for capital loss.\nHowever, there were, in his view, other trading losses that were not inherent, and which were not, therefore, to be accounted for in the award for capital loss.\nThose trading losses were attributable to the appellant's own conduct in electing to operate the business at a lower level, and, therefore, not compensable.\n26 In my view, in discounting the difference between the price paid and the amount obtained on sale, the Federal Magistrate, in effect, determined that the \"true value\" of the business by the date of sale, had been reduced to some extent by \"extraneous factors\" --- namely, the election of the appellant to operate the business at a lower level than it could have been operated.\nHis Honour, therefore, made an allowance to accommodate that finding.\nSubject to the evidentiary limitation as to the value of the business already referred to, this approach generally accords with the tenor of the observations by the High Court in Kizbeau.\n27 The next question is whether there was evidence to support the Federal Magistrate's finding that the appellant operated the business at a lower level than it could have been operated.\nThe appellant contended that there was not.\n28 The evidence was that prior to the appellant purchasing the business, Mr McKenzie carried on business as a therapeutic masseur, a courier and a postman.\nHe had no sales experience.\nBefore purchasing the business, Mr and Mrs Mckenzie knew from the sales document that the performance of the business would depend upon a high level of direct sales contact, and that 80% of the revenue was generated by direct sales contact.\nBefore the appellant contracted to purchase the business there were two full-time experienced sales representatives working in the business --- one of whom was Mr McCaughan.\nOn taking over the business, Mr McKenzie started assisting the remaining sales representative, Mr Milton, in sales activities.\nWithin three months Mr Milton left the employment of the appellant.\nThe appellant decided not to replace Mr Milton, leaving Mr McKenzie, a person with no prior sales experience, as the only sales representative.\n29 Mrs McKenzie said in evidence that the reason why the sales representative was not replaced was to cut costs, and that she was confident Mr McKenzie could perform well as a sales representative.\n30 In my view, there was evidence before the Federal Magistrate upon which it was open to conclude that the decision to operate with one inexperienced sales representative, was a decision to operate a business at a lower level than it could have been operated.\n31 The grounds of appeal which raise these points fail.\n32 I now deal with the appellant's contention that the Federal Magistrate erred in not awarding damages in respect of the losses associated with the motor vehicles it acquired and used in the business.\n (a) $14,250.34 --- in respect of two of the three vehicles acquired on the purchase of the business, which were traded-in on a new Mitsubishi Pajero vehicle in July 2002; being the difference between the amount obtained by the appellant when the vehicles were traded-in, and the amount which was then outstanding on the finance leases in respect of those vehicles.\n (c) $3,636.37 - being the difference between the true value of a vehicle which Mr and Mrs McKenzie owned privately, prior to the purchase of the business, and the amount obtained on trading it in as part of the July 2002 transaction.\n33 The Federal Magistrate did not award any damages in respect of this claim.\nIn my view, the Federal Magistrate erred in declining to award damages under this head of claim.\nConsistent with the findings made by the Federal Magistrate, the appellant was induced to acquire three motor vehicles for an amount in excess of the true value of the vehicles as a direct consequence of the misleading or deceptive conduct.\nThe usual measure of damages to be applied in relation to the losses associated with the motor vehicles would, on the principles referred to in Kizbeau , be the difference between the price paid for the three motor vehicles acquired with the business (being the vehicles referred to in [32(a)] and [32(b)]) and their value at the date of purchase.\nThe appellant did not produce evidence of the amount which the appellant undertook to pay in respect of each of the three vehicles under the novated arrangements entered into at the time of the purchase of the business, nor of the true value of the vehicles at that time.\nDoing the best I can and, acting on the evidence which was before the Federal Magistrate, I would award damages in the amount claimed of $14,867.34 in respect of those three vehicles.\n34 As to the loss claimed in respect of the sale of the vehicle referred to in [32(c)], the evidence does not establish a causal connection between the contravening conduct and the loss which was allegedly incurred through trading-in the pre-existing family car in order to purchase a new vehicle.\nThe evidence did not establish that it was necessary to sell that vehicle, as opposed to the vehicle referred to in [32(b)], nor that the failure by the appellant to obtain a trade-in amount which represented the true value of the vehicle at the appropriate time, was attributable to the contravening conduct.\n35 The next head of damage to the claim which it is said the Federal Magistrate ought to have allowed was for earnings forgone by reason of unrewarded work during the period 1 July 2002 to 21 November 2003 --- when the appellant sold the business.\nUnder this head, the appellant claimed the amount of $25,197.\n36 This amount was derived from a claim that Mr McKenzie earned $18,198 in the 2002 financial year as a therapeutic masseur, courier and postman.\nThe claim was said to be evidenced by his taxation return for 2002.\nThe Federal Magistrate rejected this claim on the basis that the amount he awarded for capital loss covered this loss.\nHe also said that it would not be appropriate to make such an award because it was clear that some income and benefit was derived from the conduct of the business.\nHowever, the Federal Magistrate did not give reasons for coming to that view.\n37 In my view, the Federal Magistrate erred in failing to award an amount in respect of that head.\nThe evidence was that Mr McKenzie was required to work full-time in the business and that the business was a loss-making business.\nThe inference is open on the evidence that had the partners not bought the business, Mr McKenzie would have continued to operate his massage business and his courier business and would have earned income during the period in question.\nThere are a number of authorities which support the proposition that where a person, in reliance upon the contravening conduct, purchases and works in a loss-making business without reward, that party is entitled to receive compensation for income forgone ( Cut Price Deli Pty Limited v Jacques (1994) 49 FCR 397, Crystal Auburn Pty Ltd v IL Wollermann Pty Ltd [2004] FCA 821).\nI would allow the appellant's appeal in respect of this claim.\n38 As previously mentioned, the quantum of the claim was based on the evidence of Mr McKenzie's tax return for the financial year ended June 2002.\nDuring cross-examination Mrs McKenzie was unable to explain how that figure of $18,198 was derived from the 2002 tax return.\nIn my view, the tax return only supports an annual income after expenditure of $12,655.\nIt is that figure which should provide the basis for assessing damages in respect of the claim for income forgone, with the consequence that I would award $17,500 damages under this head.\n39 The appellant also claimed financing and borrowing costs.\nThe financing and borrowing costs claimed comprised fees related to obtaining finance in order to purchase the business, as well as interest and fees on the business overdraft.\nThe fees relating to the raising of the money to complete the purchase of the business comprised broker's fees of $1,485 and bank fees of $1,598.25.\n40 The Federal Magistrate rejected this head of claim on the basis of observations in the case of Yorke v Lucas (1982) 69 FLR 116 that these costs were not compensable because they were incurred as the result of the lack of ready money to pay for the purchase of the business, and not the direct consequence of the purchase of the business.\nSince that case, the High Court has observed that ordinarily an award of damages under s 82 of the TPA will compensate for the actual loss incurred where the contravening conduct is a cause of that loss ( I &amp; L Securities Pty Ltd v HTW Valuers (Brisbane) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 41 ; (2002) 210 CLR 109 at 121-122, at [33], at 125-126, at [50] and at 130, at [62]).\nOn the basis of the Federal Magistrate's finding that the appellant purchased the business in reliance on the contravening conduct, the incurring of the fees to raise finance to purchase the business would be causally connected to the contravening conduct.\nIn my view, the Federal Magistrate should have accepted the appellant's claim for these fees, being fees relating to the completion of the purchase of the business.\nI would, accordingly, award the appellant damages in the sum of $3,083.25.\n41 The interest and bank fees payable on the business overdraft after the purchase of the business until the sale of the business in November 2003, are embraced within the claim made in respect of the trading losses.\nThe Federal Magistrate did not err in rejecting the claim for those amounts.\n42 The appellant also made a claim in respect of ongoing interest paid after the sale of the business in November 2003, on the outstanding balance of the loan taken out to purchase the business.\nIn my view, for the reasons referred to above, the Federal Magistrate should have accepted this claim as a head of consequential loss.\nThe amount that the appellant claims under this heading is not fully particularised.\nUp to February 2004, the amount claimed is $2,510 and between July 2004 to January 2005, the amount is $6,498.\nTo those sums I would add an amount of $3,600 reflecting the intervening months.\nThe rounded total would be $12,600.\nIn my view, however, any amount awarded in respect of this head should reflect the Federal Magistrate's finding that the performance of the business, and therefore, the extent of the outstanding balance of the borrowing, was affected by the appellant electing to run the business at a lower level.\nDoing the best I can on the evidence, I would award the sum of $9,000 under this head.\n43 As to the claim in respect of the refund of the rent, in my view, the Federal Magistrate did not err in refusing that claim.\nThe Federal Magistrate correctly found that the appellant suffered no loss because it obtained value for the monies that it paid by way of rent.\n44 It follows that the appellant's appeal is allowed in part.\nI will hear the parties on costs and the terms of the order.\nI certify that the preceding forty-four (44) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Siopis.\nDated: 16 August 2007\n Counsel for the Appellant: Mr Alan Rumsley \n Solicitor for the Appellant: Mr Alan Rumsley \n Counsel for the Respondent: The Respondent did not

        "description": "1 The applicant, a Sri Lankan national of Tamil ethnicity, arrived in Australia on 22 September 1996 on a three month visitor visa.\nOn 6 December 1996, that visa was extended to 22 June 1997.\nOn 10 April 1997, she lodged with the first respondent an application for a protection visa.\nIn substance, she claimed that if she returned to Sri Lanka she faced a real chance of persecution at the hands of the Sri Lankan authorities by reason of her Tamil ethnicity, and because those authorities would impute to her a particular political opinion as a supposed supporter of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (\"the LTTE\").\nShe relied upon four specific incidents, which she claimed had occurred in her life, as evidence that her fear of persecution was well-founded.\n2 On 10 September 1997, a delegate of the Minister refused the application.\nOn 26 September 1997, the applicant lodged an application for review with the Refugee Review Tribunal (\"the Tribunal\").\nOn 30 October 2000, the Tribunal conducted a hearing at which the applicant, who was represented, gave evidence.\nOn 27 July 2001, the Tribunal affirmed the delegate's decision not to grant the applicant a protection visa.\n3 On 23 August 2001, the applicant filed with this Court an application for review of the Tribunal's decision.\nThat application was ultimately heard by Gray J.\nBecause it was filed prior to the commencement, on 2 October 2001, of the privative clause amendments to the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (\"the Act \"), the \"old\" Pt 8 of the Act applied.\n4 By amended application, dated 28 September 2001, the applicant provided particulars of her grounds of review.\nThese are set out at [19] in the judgment of Gray J, whereby his Honour, on 30 May 2002, dismissed the application: see [2002] FCA 683.\n \"(a) the Tribunal erred in not determining that the detention and questioning of the applicant, together with harassment and threats after the Central Bank bomb blast in early 1996, was persecution for reasons of race or political opinion within the meaning of the Convention; \n (b) the Tribunal erred when it said that it was \"not convinced\" that the applicant was detained as she alleged in what I have described as the fourth episode; \n (c) the Tribunal erred in not finding that the repeated detention and questioning, especially at checkpoints, of the applicant, and the Tamil people in general, amounted to persecution, or might amount to persecution in the reasonably foreseeable future; and \n (d) the Tribunal erred in failing to determine whether the length of absence of the applicant from Sri Lanka would give rise to well-founded fear of persecution for a Convention reason should she now return to Sri Lanka.\n5 It is important to note that the applicant did not appeal from Gray J's judgment dismissing her application for review.\nHowever, on 21 June 2002, the applicant filed with the High Court, an application for constitutional writs in respect of the Tribunal's decision.\nHer draft order nisi set out various grounds of judicial review, all of them cast in the most general of terms.\n \"... persecution within the meaning of the definition of a refugee under the Refugees Convention, as incorporated by reference to section 36 (2) of the Migration Act 1958 could occur as a result of being an imputed supporter of the LTTE.\n6 On 7 February 2003, the High Court (Hayne J) ordered that the further proceedings in that application be remitted to this Court.\nOn 23 April 2003, Marshall J ordered that the applicant file and serve an amended application by 15 May 2003, and any contentions of fact and law by 22 May 2003.\nOn 20 June 2003, four days before the application was scheduled to be heard, the applicant wrote to the Court withdrawing her application, and indicating that she was prepared to pay the reasonable costs of the Minister.\nThat letter was treated by the Court as being, in substance, a notice of discontinuance that met the requirements of O 22, r 2 of the Federal Court Rules .\nUnder O 22, r 3, a party who discontinues a proceeding is liable to pay the costs of the other party or parties occasioned by the proceeding.\nUnder O 22, r 7, an order for discontinuance does not operate as an extinguishment of the action, or in any way bar further proceedings: see SZFOG v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1374 per Edmonds J at [16]-[18].\nIt may, however, be relevant when determining whether the institution of such further proceedings amounts to an abuse of process.\n7 On 18 July 2003, less than a month later, the applicant filed with the High Court a second application for constitutional writs in respect of the Tribunal's decision.\nIn that second application she sought orders for the issue of writs of prohibition and certiorari.\nOn 26 February 2004, Hayne J ordered that the further proceedings in that second application be remitted to this Court.\nHis Honour further ordered that the application proceed in this Court as if the steps already taken in the High Court had been taken in this Court.\nIt is that second application that constitutes the proceeding before this Court.\n8 In the present proceeding, the draft order nisi sets out various general grounds of judicial review.\nThe document was apparently prepared without legal assistance, and is, for that reason, somewhat uninformative.\nSo too are the applicant's contentions of fact and law, filed prior to the hearing, which focus in part upon several passages in the judgment of Gray J in the earlier proceeding in this Court.\nIn those passages, his Honour referred to \"unsettling aspects of the Tribunal's reasons\", in particular, its use of the expression that it was \"not ... convinced of the truth of some aspects of the applicant's evidence\".\nHis Honour also found that the Tribunal had made various factual errors, but went on to explain why the application before him could not, in any event, succeed.\nThe applicant's written contentions relied, in part, upon his Honour's observations.\nHowever, they did not identify any error on the part of the Tribunal that might give rise to jurisdictional error.\n9 It is obvious from what is set out above that the applicant faces a series of hurdles in seeking to have this Court set aside the Tribunal's decision.\nIn the first place, several of the matters of which she now complains were raised, in substance at least, before Gray J, and determined adversely to her.\nAs previously indicated, there was no appeal from his Honour's judgment.\n10 In addition, the very matters that the applicant now seeks to agitate were all raised in her initial application for constitutional writs in the High Court.\nThat application contained the same grounds, and the same particulars to those grounds, as are raised in the present proceeding.\nThe fact that the applicant ultimately discontinued that proceeding after it had been remitted to this Court creates a difficulty, so far as she is concerned, regarding the success of this application.\n11 It can be argued that at least so much of the present application as was determined against the applicant by Gray J is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\nHis Honour's judgment was a final judgment, dealing essentially with at least some of the very same matters that the applicant now seeks to rely upon.\nHer failure to appeal that judgment may represent an insuperable obstacle to at least that part of her case.\n12 Alternatively, even if it can be said that the present proceeding is based upon a cause of action that differs in certain respects from the case that was determined by Gray J, so that the doctrine of res judicata does not apply, it is at least arguable that principles of issue estoppel, or Anshun estoppel, prevent these claims from being pursued.\nSee generally Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45 ; (1981) 147 CLR 589; see also VWZG v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1018 at [10] - [14] .\n13 The applicant was not represented before me.\nShe said that she had signed the 20 June 2003 letter indicating that she wished to withdraw her application for review in circumstances where she had not appreciated the effect of adopting that course.\nShe was not legally represented at the time, and had merely been given informal advice by a migration agent.\nShe claimed, in relation to this proceeding, that she had approached a lawyer to act for her, but had been told that there was some impediment to that lawyer doing so.\nShe indicated that the lawyer had expressed concern about being personally liable for any costs that might be incurred in pursuing the litigation.\n14 I must say that I have some difficulty in accepting this account in its entirety.\nNonetheless, even if what I was told was correct, the applicant still faces difficulties in pursuing this application.\n15 Putting to one side questions of res judicata and issue estoppel, the applicant must explain why she did not commence proceedings seeking constitutional writs until approximately two years after the Tribunal's decision.\nHer explanation that she thought she had initiated an appeal from Gray J's judgment when she first issued proceedings in the High Court, if accepted, goes part of the way towards answering the delay that has ensued.\nThe proceedings in the High Court were brought shortly after Gray J's judgment was delivered.\nThe fact remains, however, that the applicant ultimately discontinued that proceeding, and then reinstated it.\nThere is no escaping the fact that there was a delay of approximately two years between the Tribunal's decision, and the filing of the application for constitutional writs.\nA delay of that length requires both adequate explanation, and some justification.\n16 Different views have been expressed as to whether, when the High Court remits a matter of this type to this Court, the time limits that are provided for under the High Court Rules are applicable to this Court.\nIf those time limits are applicable, the applicant must seek an extension of time within which to bring this proceeding.\nIf the time limits are not applicable, no formal application for an extension of time is required, but the question of delay will still be relevant when considering whether to refuse relief in the exercise of the Court's discretion.\n17 Order 55, r17(1) of the High Court Rules provides that that an application for an order nisi for a writ of certiorari must be brought within six months of the decision under challenge.\nOrder 60, r 6(1) enables a judge to enlarge time.\nHowever, the discretion thereby conferred must be exercised judicially.\n18 In Applicants M16 of 2004 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2005] FCA 1641 , Gray J expressed doubt as to whether the time limits contained in the High Court Rules were applicable once a proceeding had been remitted from the High Court to this Court.\nIn that regard, it should be noted that there are no specific time limits in the Federal Court Rules within which applications for certiorari must be brought.\n19 If the time limits set out in the High Court Rules are applicable to this proceeding, the principles that govern the exercise of the power to enlarge time under those rules were outlined with great clarity by McHugh J in Re Commonwealth of Australia; Ex parte Marks [2000] HCA 67 ; (2000) 177 ALR 491.\nIn particular, his Honour observed that a case \"would need to be exceptional\" before the time for commencing proceedings was enlarged by many months.\nIn deciding whether or not to enlarge time, the Court may take into account any explanation for the delay in commencing proceedings, and the applicant's prospects for success in the proceedings.\nMoreover, as the constitutional writs are directed at the acts or decisions of public bodies or officials, the public interest requires that there be an end to litigation regarding the efficacy of such acts or decisions.\n \"Independently of the merits of the case, I find it difficult to see how a person who, with knowledge of the decision, delays 17 months before seeking relief could ever be granted an extension of time to quash such a decision unless some conduct of the respondent or the public body or official had brought about the delay.\nAs the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council said in Ratnam v Cumarasamy , \"[t]he rules of court must prima facie be obeyed\".\nThe time for seeking certiorari is six times, and the time for seeking mandamus is twice, the period in which an application for special leave to appeal to this court can be brought against a judgment or decision.\nThe periods for applying for certiorari and mandamus give a person affected by an adverse decision or judgment ample time in which to commence proceedings in this court.\nIn all but very exceptional cases, they should be rigidly applied when, as here, more than one year has elapsed between the decision and the commencement of proceedings in this court.\n21 In Applicant M70 of 2002 v Minister for Immigration &amp; Multicultural &amp; Indigenous Affairs [2004] FCAFC 132 , a Full Court (Heerey, Dowsett and Bennett JJ) cited these comments of McHugh J, and said at [8]:\n \"Applying those observations and, by analogy, the time limits in the High Court Rules to the present case, relief should be declined for reason of delay.\n22 It may be noted that the expression \"by analogy\" in the passage set out above lends support to Gray J's view that the time limits set out in the High Court Rules do not ordinarily apply to matters that have been remitted to this Court.\nIt is, of course, possible that the judge who remits the matter to this Court will order that those time limits do apply.\nHowever, that did not occur in this case.\n23 I should add that although the applicant seeks an order nisi for a writ of prohibition, as well as an order nisi for a writ of certiorari, and there is no specific time limit in the High Court Rules in relation to prohibition, it is plain that she can gain no comfort from this.\nProhibition is not an appropriate remedy when challenging a decision of the Tribunal that has already been made.\nThere is nothing left to prohibit.\nOnce the Tribunal has made its decision, it has no further function to perform.\n24 If the order nisi for a writ of prohibition is directed to the Minister, seemingly with the intention of preventing her from giving effect to the Tribunal's decision, the remedy may, nonetheless, be inappropriate.\nIn Re Ruddock; Ex parte Reyes (2000) 177 ALR 484 (\" Reyes \"), McHugh J held that even if certiorari was granted to quash the Tribunal's decision, there should be no order for prohibition against the Minister.\n \"there is no ground whatever in a case such as the present for the issue of a writ of prohibition against the minister.\nAs was conceded, as the law stands at the moment and on the facts of the case, the minister was under a duty, in accordance with s 198 of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) (the Act ), to deport the applicant.\nNo claim for prohibition could possibly be made on the basis of his personal fault or breach of the law or jurisdictional error.\n25 McHugh J went on to say that the proper remedies in a case in which a decision of the Tribunal is challenged are certiorari and mandamus, both of which should be directed to the Tribunal.\n26 The reasoning in Reyes seems difficult to reconcile with the later decision of Merkel J in Thayananthan v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2003] FCA 1054 in which his Honour accepted the possibility that prohibition might be an appropriate remedy in cases of this type.\n27 It is unnecessary for me to express any concluded view regarding the divergent approaches taken in these two cases.\nAs will shortly be seen the applicant's claim for an order nisi for a writ of prohibition fails for other reasons.\n28 Moreover, I do not consider it necessary determine this case on the basis of res judicata, issue estoppel or abuse of process.\nNor is it necessary to resolve the question whether time should be enlarged (if the High Court Rules are applicable), or whether relief should be refused as a discretionary matter by reason of delay (if those rules are not applicable).\n29 The real difficulty that confronts the applicant is that she is unable to point to any jurisdictional error on the part of the Tribunal that would justify setting aside its decision.\n30 During the course of oral argument, the applicant handed up a written document headed \"Submission\" which purported to identify errors in the Tribunal's reasoning that would warrant the issue of constitutional writs.\n \"1.\nIt is submitted that the Tribunal erred in applying the wrong test in determining whether the applicant had a well founded fear of persecution.\n The Tribunal in its findings and reasons stated that the treatment of the applicant after the Central Bank bombings and from time to time at checkpoints did not amount to persecution indicates that the Tribunal did not have a proper understanding of the word persecution.\n It is submitted that the action suffered by the applicant were based upon the authorities profiling her as a Tamil likely to be a supporter of the LTTE or even as a member of that organization.\n 2.\nThe use by the Tribunal of words suggesting that \"it was not convinced\" of the Applicant's evidence that she was arrested and detained twice following the DEHIWELA bombing.\n This suggests that the Tribunal was imposing an onus of proof upon the applicant.\n 3.\nThe Tribunal failed to apply the real chance test as to what might happen in the future.\n 4.\nThe Tribunal treated as trivial events suffered by the applicant i.e.\ndetention by police and being stopped at checkpoints.\n It is suggested that the events the applicant complained of amounts to a well founded fear of persecution.\n 5.\nIt is submitted that the Tribunal asked the wrong questions and applied the wrong tests in determining whether the four series of events the applicant complained of amounted to a well founded fear of persecution for a convention reason.\n31 It should be noted that at least the first two points set out in the submission were dealt with by Gray J at [20]-[25] of his Honour's judgment.\nThis proceeding is not, of course, an appeal from that judgment.\nNonetheless, I have had regard to what his Honour had to say about these issues, and I can see no basis for arriving at any different conclusions.\n32 Gray J found, at [23], that the Tribunal had correctly understood that the notion of persecution, to which the Refugees Convention refers, necessarily contemplates that there is a real chance that a person will suffer \"some serious punishment or penalty or some significant detriment or disadvantage\".\nHis Honour noted that the Tribunal had also referred to the need to demonstrate selective harassment (which may, in appropriate cases, include single acts of oppression, serious violations of human rights, and measures in disregard of human dignity).\nHis Honour concluded that although the Tribunal's references to these principles \"were in standard form\", there was nothing to indicate that it had not applied them in its reasoning.\nHe found that it had been open to the Tribunal to conclude that any harm that the applicant may have suffered had not been inflicted because of any of the Refugees Convention reasons.\n33 Gray J also dealt specifically, and in terms, with the second point now made by the applicant in her written submission.\nHis Honour concluded that, when read in context, the passage containing the expression \"not ... convinced\" did not suggest that the Tribunal had erroneously imposed an onus of proof upon the applicant.\n34 With respect, I agree with both these conclusions.\nIt follows that neither of the first two points raised in the applicant's submission can succeed.\n35 The remaining three points set out in the submission can fairly be described as either being insufficiently particularised to identify any reviewable error, or as merely inviting merits review.\nAccordingly, those contentions must be rejected.\n36 For the reasons set out above, the application must be dismissed, with costs.\nI certify that the preceding thirty-six (36) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Weinberg.\nDated: 3 February 2006\n The applicant

        "description": "BUCHANAN J: \n1 On 7 December 2007 I dismissed all the applicant's claims ( McDonald v Parnell Laboratories (Aust) [2007] FCA 1903).\nI did not then deal with the question of costs.\nThe respondents have now made an application for costs, including indemnity costs, in the amount of $203,909.89.\n2 The basis of the claim for indemnity costs is that on 20 July 2007 the respondents made an offer of compromise to settle the proceedings.\nIn that offer, which was open for acceptance for 17 days (until 6 August 2007) Ms McDonald was offered payment of a sum equivalent to eight weeks salary ($18,461.54) plus interest at the rate of 10.5% from 30 June 2006 to 20 July 2007 ($2,044.68), payment of a further amount of $10,000 and payment of her costs in accordance with Schedule 1 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 .\nAt that time the proceedings were before the Federal Magistrates Court of Australia ('the FMCA').\n3 The offer was not accepted and it lapsed on 6 August 2007.\nOn 31 July 2007, while the offer to Ms McDonald was still open, the respondents applied to transfer the proceedings from the FMCA to this Court.\nAn order to that effect was made by consent on 9 August 2007.\nAt the time of their transfer the proceedings invoked the jurisdiction of this Court to deal with matters arising under federal legislation in two ways.\nMs McDonald alleged breach of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) and breaches of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (Cth) ('the WR Act').\nApart from claims arising under federal legislation Ms McDonald made claims in contract and tort.\nSuch claims were within the jurisdiction of the Court by reason of s 32 of the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 (Cth ).\n4 One of the principal issues to be dealt with in this judgment is whether indemnity costs should be awarded as a matter of discretion in circumstances where O 23 r 11 of the Federal Court Rules does not apply.\nAnother is whether the existence in the WR Act of provisions which limit the award of costs in proceedings under that Act (s 666 and s 824 in particular) operate to inhibit an award of costs in the present matter.\nA major plank in Ms McDonald's resistance to the costs orders sought is a contention that claims made under the WR Act were protected from costs orders, along with all other claims in the proceedings, to a substantial degree.\nAlthough I will deal with some of the issues which arise concerning the second of these two principal aspects it will not be necessary to deal with them all.\nUltimately, even if I had concluded that the limitations on the award of costs operated to the extent suggested on Ms McDonald's behalf, nevertheless, for reasons I will endeavour to explain, consistently with those restrictions I would still have made the orders finally determined.\n5 When proceedings were commenced in the FMCA Ms McDonald relied, by Points of Claim filed on 27 March 2007, on claims that the respondent had breached s 659 of the WR Act (which makes termination of employment for certain reasons unlawful) and also s 253 and s 255 (which concern obligations on an employee to give notice of absences taken as sick leave and carers leave).\nReliance on these two latter sections was abandoned with the filing of Amended Points of Claim on 8 June 2007.\n6 In the Amended Points of Claim, s 659(2)(f) of the WR Act was specified as the particular obligation said to have been breached by the termination of Ms McDonald's employment.\n '(4) An employer must not unreasonably: \n (a) refuse to authorise an employee to take an amount of annual leave that is credited to the employee; or \n (b) revoke an authorisation enabling an employee to take annual leave during a particular period.\nIn Further Amended Points of Claim filed in this Court on 4 October 2007 the allegation of breach of s 659(2)(f) of the WR Act was withdrawn.\nReliance on s 236(4) was also withdrawn.\nIn the result it was not ultimately necessary to decide any issue concerning an alleged breach of the WR Act.\n 'it is a fundamental tenet of federal jurisdiction that once a federal claim is made, even a bad one, and even one that is abandoned, or struck out, the whole matter in which that claim is made is, and remains, federal jurisdiction ...' \n(see Macteldir Pty Ltd v Dimovski (2005) 226 ALR 773 at [36] and the cases there referred to).\nSimilarly, as will be discussed, provisions limiting the payment of costs in relation to claims made under the WR Act have been held to extend to the whole proceedings and to apply to other claims dealt with in the same proceedings.\n8 Prima facie, therefore, proceedings concerning claims alleging breaches of s 236(4), s 253 and s 255 of the WR Act (s 659(2)(f) needs separate attention) engaged the operation of s 824 of that Act.\n '(1) A party to a proceeding (including an appeal) in a matter arising under this Act (other than an application under section 663) must not be ordered to pay costs incurred by any other party to the proceeding unless the first-mentioned party instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause.\n (2) Despite subsection (1), if a court hearing a proceeding (including an appeal) in a matter arising under this Act (other than an application under section 663) is satisfied that a party to the proceeding has, by an unreasonable act or omission, caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding, the court may order the first-mentioned party to pay some or all of those costs.\n (3) In subsections (1) and (2): \n costs includes all legal and professional costs and disbursements and expenses of witnesses.\n9 Neither s 253 or s 255 impose any obligation upon an employer or create any right for the benefit of an employee.\nThey each, on the contrary, impose an obligation on an employee to give adequate notice before claiming an absence from work as sick leave or carer's leave.\nThose claims were misconceived and should not have been made.\nI am satisfied that the claims made in purported reliance on s 253 and s 255 of the WR Act were made without reasonable cause.\nHowever, that does not mean that the proceedings in which those claims were made were instituted without reasonable cause.\n10 Prima facie also, reliance on s 659(2)(f) of the WR Act engaged the operation of s 666 of that Act.\n '(1) Subject to this section, a party to a proceeding under section 663 must not be ordered to pay costs incurred by any other party to the proceeding unless the court hearing the matter is satisfied that the first-mentioned party: \n (a) instituted the proceeding vexatiously or without reasonable cause; or \n (b) caused the costs to be incurred by that other party because of an unreasonable act or omission of the first-mentioned party in connection with the conduct of the proceeding.\n (2) Subsection (1) does not empower a court to award costs in circumstances specified in that subsection if the court does not have the power to do so \n (3) In this section: \n costs includes all legal and professional costs and disbursements and expenses of witnesses.\n11 Section 666, therefore, unlike s 824, contemplates a proceeding under a particular provision --- s 663.\nSection 663 permits an employee to apply, inter alia, with respect to an alleged breach of s 659 as Ms McDonald purported to do.\nThe claim of breach of s 659 must be seen as an attempt to institute a proceeding under s 663.\n '(5) An application under subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4) in respect of an alleged contravention of section 659, 660 or 661 may not be made to a court unless the applicant: \n (a) has received a certificate under subsection 650(2) regarding conciliation of an application made wholly or partly on the ground of the alleged contravention; and \n (b) has elected under section 651 to begin proceedings in that court for an order under section 665 in respect of the alleged contravention.\n12 It was not disputed that no certificate under s 650(2) had been given.\nNo election under s 651 had been made.\nFurthermore, counsel for the respondents relied on the fact that a certificate under s 650(2) is only available following conciliation proceedings conducted pursuant to an application first made to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission pursuant to s 643 of the WR Act.\nNo such application had ever been made.\nIndeed, such an application was statute-barred by s 674 of the WR Act because Ms McDonald had already sought a remedy for the termination of her employment, alleging it was unlawful, relying upon the Sex Discrimination Act .\nCounsel for the respondents argued, accordingly, that no proceeding had been instituted under s 663 and no protection arose under s 666.\nThe argument is tarnished somewhat by the fact that these points were never pleaded, although it may have been in recognition of them that reliance upon s 659 of the WR Act was ultimately abandoned.\n13 Counsel for Ms McDonald on the present application sought to argue, relying on Berowra Holdings Pty Limited v Gordon [2006] HCA 32 ; (2006) 225 CLR 364 ( 'Berowra Holdings' ) (especially at 369-377) that s 663(5) was merely a provision postponing a remedy, of the kind considered in that case.\nThe argument cannot assist Ms McDonald in the present case.\nThe right given by s 659(2)(f) is a special statutory right.\nVindication of it is available only in accordance with the statutory arrangements which accompany the grant of the right ( Josephson v Walker [1914] HCA 68 ; (1914) 18 CLR 691).\nThe combination of circumstances pointed to by counsel for the respondents appears to me to set up a fatal obstacle to reliance upon s 659(2)(f) of the WR Act.\nThat does not mean that the Court lacked jurisdiction, or that the claim based on s 659(2)(f), even if doomed to fail, fell outside the ambit of the federal matters with which the Court was dealing in the proceedings.\nIt does, however, mean that the attempt to invoke s 659(2)(f) was without reasonable cause.\nIn this instance, as the proceedings in question (to which s 666 refers) are limited to proceedings under s 663, no question arises of the proceedings having greater content than the alleged breach of s 659(2)(f).\nAccordingly, s 666 of the WR Act gave no protection against an order for costs.\n14 That conclusion makes it unnecessary to deal with an argument by counsel for the respondents that no proceeding under s 663 had been instituted.\nThis contention could not, in any event, dispose of all the WR Act claims, much less the proceedings in which those claims were made, even accepting that individual claims were made without reasonable cause.\nIt does not dispose, moreover, of the claim made under s 236(4) of the WR Act.\nAlthough this allegation was only advanced as a particular to a pleaded allegation of breach of contract I agree with counsel for the applicant that it was sufficient, questions of merit aside, to raise an issue under the WR Act.\nProceedings relating to it therefore, at least for as long as they remained on foot, were proceedings in a matter arising under the WR Act within the meaning of s 824.\n15 However the matter is examined, there were proceedings on foot, at the time the proceedings were transferred to this Court at least, in which claims under the WR Act, however unmeritorious, were made, along with other, more substantial, claims.\nDoes that, prima facie at least, suggest that no order for costs can be made at all in the proceedings?\n16 It has been held that protections of the kind granted by s 824(1) extend to all non-federal claims made in the same proceedings (see Maritime Union of Australia v Geraldton Port Authority (No 2) [2000] FCA 16 ; 94 IR 404 at [61] --- [78] ( 'Geraldton Port Authority' )).\n17 On the other hand, in Seven Network (Operations) Ltd v Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance [2004] FCA 637 ; (2004) 148 FCR 145 ('Seven Network Operations' ) Gyles J held (at [61]) that a separate federal claim under a different federal statute was not 'in a matter arising under' the WR Act within the meaning of the statutory predecessor to s 824(1) (s 347(1) which is indistinguishable).\nHis Honour concluded, in that case, that costs should be awarded, but only such costs as 'would not have been incurred in relation to the s 347 cause of action in any event and are only attributable to the other successful causes of action'.\nIn Bahonko v Sterjov [2007] FCA 1341 Jessup J followed Seven Network Operations observing that it appeared to be 'the only occasion upon which the Court has decided a costs application by reference to the fact that the proceeding involved claims arising under different federal statutes, one of which was the WR Act'.\nI should follow the same course.\n18 The approach in Seven Network Operations may not be easy to apply in some cases although, in the present case, it is reasonably clear that no costs should have been incurred in relation to allegations of breach of the WR Act from 4 October 2007 when all such claims were formally abandoned.\nAs the matter proceeded thereafter on the basis of a separate federal claim (as well as the common law claims) I am satisfied that, whatever view is taken of the operation of s 824 of the WR Act, there is no restriction on the award of costs from that source on and from the abandonment of reliance on the WR Act --- i.e.\n4 October 2007.\nI should emphasise that I do not intend, by this conclusion, to suggest any departure from the principles stated by Nicholson J in Geraldton Port Authority .\nIn the present case there were proceedings in a federal matter independently of the claims under the WR Act.\nWhen the claims under the WR Act were abandoned it became possible to differentiate between costs attributable to proceedings connected with the WR Act claims and costs in federal proceedings not (or no longer) connected with the WR Act claims.\nIn a case where (initially) non-federal claims are associated only with WR Act claims, abandoning the latter may not disengage the operation of s 824 of the WR Act.\n19 I shall return in due course to examine the potential operation of s 824 before 4 October 2007 in the light of the offer of compromise made on 20 July 2007.\nFirst, however, it is desirable to assess the respondents' entitlement to costs on and from 4 October 2007.\n20 Should costs in respect of non-WR Act claims from 4 October 2007 be awarded on an indemnity basis?\nThe circumstance of an applicant failing altogether to obtain any relief, after a respondent has made an offer of compromise, is not covered by O 23 r 11 of the Federal Court Rules .\nThat is an omission which has attracted some criticism.\n21 In Coshott v Learoyd [1999] FCA 276 (' Coshott' ) Wilcox J reviewed a number of cases discussing the circumstances in which rejection of an offer of compromise (whether pursuant to O 23 or a Calderbank offer), followed by complete failure at trial, should lead to the award of indemnity costs against an unsuccessful applicant.\nHis Honour doubted that an applicant's conduct in rejecting the offer must be 'plainly unreasonable' before indemnity costs will be ordered.\n 'whether or not it is correct to talk about a \"prima facie presumption\", non-acceptance of an Order 23 offer should at least be regarded as providing to the offeror a good start in the task of persuading the court to award more than party-party costs'.\n22 In Dukemaster Pty Ltd v Bluehive Pty Ltd [2003] FCAFC 1 ( 'Dukemaster' ) Sundberg and Emmett JJ said, in a case like the present where O 23 r 11 did not apply because an applicant had been wholly unsuccessful, that an applicant for a more generous award of costs than party-party costs 'must show that the rejection of the offer was imprudent or plainly unreasonable' (see at [7]).\nThere has been doubt expressed about the soundness of the statement in Dukemaster that rejection of an offer, if unreasonable, must be 'plainly unreasonable' in the light of the earlier judgment of a Full Court in Black v Lipovac (1998) 217 ALR 386 at [217] --- [218], to which Wilcox J also referred in Coshott (see Seven Network Limited v News Limited [2007] FCA 1489 at [59] --- [62] ( 'Seven Network' )).\nI do not need to express any view on this issue because, as will be seen, even if the stricter test of 'plainly unreasonable' is to be applied where appropriate, I do not need to apply it to my consideration of the present application.\nIt will be sufficient to assess whether rejection of the offer was imprudent (see also APF Properties Pty Ltd v Kestrel Holdings Pty Ltd (No 3) [2007] FCA 2016 at [24] --- [25]).\n23 If an offer is made under O 23 and an applicant is partially successful, although falling short of the offer, there is a presumptive right in the respondent to indemnity costs (see O 23 r 11(5)).\nIn the present case the offer was a substantial one.\nHad Ms McDonald had a good measure of success, but not achieved a result exceeding the offer, the respondent's presumptive right would have been enlivened.\nThe absence of some provision accommodating the circumstance that an applicant fails altogether is anomalous (see also Seven Network at [57] --- [59]).\nLike Sackville J in Seven Network , I regard myself as bound by Dukemaster not to approach the matter on the basis of a presumption, despite the anomaly.\nNevertheless, I do not regard it as inconsistent with authority to follow the approach indicated by Wilcox J in Coshott which was also referred to with apparent approval in Dukemaster.\nThe respondents therefore have a 'good start' but I must also consider whether Ms McDonald was imprudent or (plainly) unreasonable to reject the offer at the time it was made.\n24 It is true that in the present case the offer was made before the proceedings were transferred to this Court and before the issues had been finally refined.\nAt the time the offer was made the applicant had survived a strike-out application and had filed and served Amended Points of Claim which provided the foundation for the application that the matter be transferred to this Court.\nThe application for transfer itself was founded upon the proposition that some of the claims raised important issues of law.\nOn the other hand, the offer, in my view, was a very reasonable one.\nIt accommodated the prospect that Ms McDonald would succeed in her claim that she should not have been summarily dismissed.\nIt accommodated the possibility of damages or compensation on some other ground as well.\n25 It should be apparent from the reasons stated in the earlier judgment that, apart from the question of summary dismissal, the remaining claims were, in my view, ambitious.\nEven if Ms McDonald had been able to make good the proposition that she should not have been summarily dismissed it would have been necessary to secure an award of additional damages or compensation on some other basis to exceed the terms of the offer.\nThe prospect of Ms McDonald succeeding in other claims (and to the extent which would be necessary) must be regarded as relatively slim.\nSome of her claims were plainly without merit.\nSome of them relied upon propositions of law which were far from settled.\nIn addition, as will be apparent from the earlier judgment, I concluded that such claims were not made out on the facts.\nThere was no issue in the principal proceedings about the basis for the termination of employment.\nFor reasons given in the earlier judgment, the uncontradicted explanation for termination of Ms McDonald's employment defeated, at the outset, any premise upon which some of the other claims depended.\nMoreover, it would have been necessary to secure an award of additional damages or compensation in excess of $10,000.\nHaving regard to the nature of the claims and the facts of the case that was an ambitious project.\n26 I think it was very imprudent of Ms McDonald not to have accepted the offer.\nI do not need to decide whether it was 'plainly unreasonable' not to do so.\nIn my view, the respondents are entitled to an order for the costs I am discussing at the moment (i.e.\nfrom 4 October 2007) on an indemnity basis, whatever may be the effect of s 824 of the WR Act on the proceedings before that time.\nIt would be unjust to deny the respondents indemnity costs, having regard to the terms of the offer, the outcome of the proceedings and the reasons for the result.\n27 That leaves the question of costs prior to the abandonment of claims under the WR Act.\nThe first question is whether it is possible to disentangle and separate the federal statutory claims prior to this date.\nIn my view it is not possible to do that.\nAll those claims invoked the jurisdiction of this Court, even to the extent they were made without reasonable cause.\nConsideration of all the claims, statutory and common law, required reference to the same substratum of facts.\nAccordingly, in my view, all the claims, federal and non-federal, should be regarded as arising in the one matter.\nPrior to the date of abandonment of the claims under the WR Act it was not possible to distinguish proceedings relating to the WR Act claims from proceedings concerning the others.\nFor the reasons given by Nicholson J in Geraldton Port Authority it follows that s 824 of the WR Act was, prima facie, engaged with respect to the whole of the proceedings (to the extent that s 666 did not apply independently).\n28 For many years provisions in the form of s 824(1) and (3) imposed strict limits on powers to award costs in matters arising under federal industrial legislation.\nSpeaking generally, costs were not available against respondents to such proceedings and might only have been awarded against applicants if the proceedings were judged to have been initiated without reasonable cause or vexatiously.\nHowever, s 824(2) (which was set out earlier) states an important qualification to that earlier policy.\nIt was included in extensive amendments made by the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 (Cth) (Act No 153 of 2005, Schedule 1, clause 206).\nIt took effect from 27 March 2006.\nIt applied to the proceedings commenced by Ms McDonald.\nIt has direct application in the present case.\n29 Jessup J has pointed out in Goldman Sachs JB Were Services Pty Limited v Nikolich [2007] FCAFC 120 (at [373]) that similar provisions were included in the statutory predecessor to s 666 from 1995.\n30 Even if it is not possible to say that the proceedings (in which claims under the WR Act were also made) were instituted without reasonable cause, or vexatiously, costs may be awarded against Ms McDonald if I conclude that she has 'by an unreasonable act or omission, caused another party to the proceeding to incur costs in connection with the proceeding'.\nAgain, I do not need to decide whether it was 'plainly unreasonable' of Ms McDonald not to accept the offer which was made to her.\nHowever, for the reasons already given, I am satisfied that it was unreasonable of her not to do so.\n31 In all the circumstances I am satisfied that under s 824(2) (and if necessary s 666(1)(b)) of the WR Act it would be proper to order Ms McDonald to also 'pay some or all of' the costs in the proceedings up to the time of the abandonment of the claims under the WR Act (and thereafter, if I am wrong in my earlier conclusion that there is a free-standing power to award costs from 4 October 2007).\nOnce that threshold is crossed there is no reason not to apply ordinary principles.\nFor reasons earlier discussed, the respondents are therefore entitled to an award of indemnity costs from an appropriate date.\nIn my view, as the matter is not covered directly by O 23 r 11, the appropriate date is the final day on which it was open to Ms McDonald to accept the offer made to her on 20 July 2007 --- i.e.\n6 August 2007.\n '5 Where in a proceeding transferred to or removed into the Court or in a proceeding on an appeal to the Court, the Court makes an order as to the costs of a proceeding before any other court, the Court may - \n (a) specify the amount of the costs to be allowed; \n (b) order that the costs be taxed in accordance with this Order; or \n (c) make orders for the ascertainment of the costs by taxation or otherwise in that other court.\n33 Until the proceedings were transferred from the FMCA on 9 August 2007 the question of costs fell to be determined by reference to Schedule 1 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 .\nCounsel for the respondents accepted during argument that it was appropriate for ordinary costs before 9 August 2007, when the proceedings were transferred to this Court, to be awarded in accordance with the arrangements for costs in the FMCA.\n34 In my view, in all the circumstances, it is appropriate to direct that costs up to 6 August 2007 be paid in accordance with Schedule 1 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 and that costs, if any, thereafter in the FMCA as well as costs in this Court be paid on an indemnity basis.\n35 The respondents initially asked me to quantify the costs and make an order for a gross amount.\nI am not prepared to do so.\n 'taxation on an indemnity basis allows all costs incurred except those unreasonably incurred or unreasonable in amount.\n36 On the material before me it is not possible to satisfactorily examine any issue of that kind.\nAlthough copies of tax invoices stating gross sums payable as professional fees from Henry Davis York are attached there is no detail provided about the matters to which those fees might relate.\nCopies of invoices from counsel are more detailed but such fees represent a minor proportion of the total fees which Ms McDonald will be asked to pay.\nThere is no reason why the assessment of costs should not receive the attention of a taxing officer who is accustomed to, and experienced in, dealing with matters of this kind.\nI will order that the costs on and from 7 August 2007 be taxed if not agreed.\n 1.\nThe applicant pay the respondents' costs up to and including 6 August 2007 in accordance with Schedule 1 of the Federal Magistrates Court Rules 2001 .\n2.\nThe applicant pay the respondents' costs from 7 August 2007 to the date of this judgment on an indemnity basis, such costs to be taxed in accordance with O 62 of the Federal Court Rules , if not agreed.\n I certify that the preceding thirty-seven (37) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the

        "id": "20",
        "description": "(REVISED FROM THE TRANSCRIPT) \n This is, as happens so often in litigation, an argument about the sterile issue of costs.\nThe plaintiffs are the consignor and consignee of a cargo of steel pipes sent under a bill of lading on the \"MV Emmagracht\" from Japan to Port Kembla.\nThe owner of the \"MV Emmagracht\" is the first defendant in the proceedings.\nThe stevedore alleged to be responsible for unloading the steel pipes, P&amp;O Automotive &amp; General Stevedoring Pty Limited, is the second defendant.\nAs might have been expected, the bill of lading contains a \" Himalaya \" clause in the widest terms which is usual in such transactions.\nIn Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 52 ; (2004) 219 CLR 165 at 193 [79] , Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ noted that courts have been ready to conclude in cases of a stevedore seeking the benefit of a Himalaya clause that the carrier was acting with the stevedore's authority.\nThey referred to the judgment of Barwick CJ in Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty Limited v Salmond &amp; Spraggon (Australia) Pty Limited [1978] HCA 8 ; (1978) 139 CLR 231 at 241.\nHis judgment was expressly approved in the last appeal to the Privy Council from the High Court of Australia: Port Jackson Stevedoring Pty Limited v Salmond &amp; Spraggon (Australia) Pty Limited (\" The New York Star \") (1980) 144 CLR 300 at 305.\n \"...not so much in the establishment of any new legal principle, as in the finding that in the normal situation involving the employment of stevedores by carriers, accepted principles enable and require the stevedore to enjoy the benefit of contractual provisions in the bill of lading.\n The authorities make it clear that it is relatively easy for a stevedore to establish a conclusion that it will be entitled to the benefit of the Himalaya clause such as is contained in clause 10(a) in the bill of lading in this case.\nThat being so, while it may be seen as prudent and precautionary for the plaintiffs to have commenced the proceedings against the stevedore, once that had been done both sides should have taken prompt steps to establish without delay whether or not the stevedore would be likely to enjoy the benefit of the bill of lading.\nThe correspondence between solicitors reveals some lack of engagement with that critical, clear and definite issue.\nThe time has long since past where courts should be obliged to deal with matters that are not seriously in dispute.\nParties to litigation, particularly in commercial and international trade litigation, ought to put their real cases forward at the earliest opportunity.\nWhere there may be an issue about the capacity in which a stevedore is acting, namely, whether in truth it was the appointed agent of the carrier for the purposes of loading or discharge from a vessel, it is a commonplace and very simple for the stevedore who wishes to rely on a Himalaya clause to put the complete facts concerning its capacity before the cargo interest seeking to allege liability against it.\nI am of opinion that it was incumbent both on the plaintiffs and the second defendant to ensure that that matter, if it were ever to be an issue, were put squarely on the litigious table at the beginning of the proceedings.\nThis question should not have been allowed to continue to this point.\nAfter the motion for a stay had been filed by the stevedore, matters came to a head on 8 September 2009 in correspondence between the parties' solicitors.\nAt that point, the plaintiffs sought to be provided with evidence that, as a matter of law, the stevedore would be entitled to the benefit of the Himalaya clause.\nUltimately, that evidence was provided earlier this week in an affidavit served by the carrier's solicitor.\nHowever, this is not now an appropriate way for parties in this kind of litigation to engage.\nIt has been almost a tradition in the past in cargo claim litigation to protract sterile, pointless disputes unnecessarily that could be resolved easily by one or both parties laying its forensic cards on the table at the beginning of the proceedings or before they are commenced.\nThis has resulted in one or both parties bedevilling the serious identification of the real issues that the court will be required to resolve when the matter is to be heard.\nThis conduct is not conformable with the Court's expectation as to how cargo claim litigation should be approached as identified in the Notice to Practitioners and Litigants issued on 18 December 2008 by the Chief Justice on the conduct of Admiralty and Maritime work in the Federal Court of Australia (see new Practice Note ADM1 issued by the Chief Justice on 25 September 2009: Admiralty and Maritime work in the Federal Court of Australia: s 11).\nAs I see it, each of the parties bears some responsibility for their joint failure to bring forward the true issue between them that required prompt identification and resolution.\nI pointed out during the course of argument that in commercial litigation of this character and, as indeed in other litigation in today's society, that approach is unacceptable for the reasons given by Allsop J in White v Overland [2001] FCA 1333 at [4] which were applied by Heydon JA with the endorsement of Mason P and Young CJ in Eq in Nowlan v Marson Transport Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 346 ; (2001) 53 NSWLR 116 at 128---129 [28]---[32] and by a Full Court of this Court in Maniotis v JH Lever &amp; Co Pty Ltd [2006] FCAFC 7 at [72] per Finn, Emmett and Bennett JJ.\n \"In the efficient and proper conduct of civil litigation, even civil litigation hard fought between parties, it should always be recognised that, in the propounding of issues for trial, the parties should take steps to ensure that all relevant parties to the dispute are cognisant of what the issues are.\nQuietly leaving footprints in correspondence or directions hearings to be uncovered some time later in an attempt to reveal that a matter was always in issue is a practice that must be firmly discouraged.\nWhere it is evident, or indeed suspected, that the other side is proceeding on the basis of a misconception or has not appreciated something, common sense will, as a general rule, mandate that a party ensure that the other is not proceeding on a misconception or that the other does appreciate something that has been said.\nNo one's interests are advanced by litigation proceeding on assumptions which are seen or suspected to be false.\nThe only consequence of keeping issues hidden or not clearly identifying them is to disrupt the business of the court leading to the waste of valuable public resources and to lead to the incurring of unnecessary costs by the parties, costs which ultimately have to be borne by someone: see White v Overland [2001] FCA 1333 at [4] .\n And as Heydon JA noted even in personal injury litigation 'the ambush theory of life has been abandoned' (53 NSWLR at 128 [30]); see too Snowy Mountains Organic Dairy Products Pty Ltd v Wholefoods Pty Ltd [2006] FCA 1361 at [15] per myself; Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineering Pty Ltd v Gordian Runoff Ltd [2008] NSWCA 243 at [160] ---[162] per Allsop P, with whom Beazley and Campbell JJA agreed.\nThese litigants and their lawyers are seasoned and experienced in the intricacies of this class of litigation.\nThey all know the likely issues and what material or evidence will be sufficient to satisfy the other side that particular issues are not worth pursing (such as the commonplace applicability of a Himalaya clause).\nThe parties have a duty to eliminate such issues as quickly and efficiently as possible.\nUltimately, the stevedore put a fall back position that it would seek its costs up to and including 8 September 2009 in respect of its motion for a stay.\nThat was the time that it was clear, between the parties, that there was no longer any issue between them because the question of the stevedore's ability to rely on the Himalaya clause had been or would soon be addressed.\nI will order that the stevedore receive 75 per cent of its costs up to and including 8 September 2009 in respect of its motion.\nI certify that the preceding ten (10) numbered paragraphs are a true copy of the Reasons for Judgment herein of the Honourable Justice Rares.\nDated: 2 October 2009\n Solicitor for the Applicants: D Luxford of Hicksons Lawyers \n Solicitor for the First Respondent: G Farnsworth of Macpherson + Kelley \n Counsel for the Second Respondent: JA Soars \n Solicitor for the Second Respondent: Blake Dawson \n Date of Hearing: 18 September 2009 \n Date of Judgment: 18 September 2009 \n AustLII: Copyright Policy | Disclaimers | Privacy Policy | Feedback \n URL: http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2009/1127.html"
